    "# **USAID FUNDING SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plays a pivotal role in supporting global development through strategic funding initiatives. In recent years, discussions around the withdrawal or reduction of USAID funding have sparked significant public response — both within the United States and in countries that have long relied on this aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to analyze the public sentiment surrounding USAID funding, particularly in relation to controversial political decisions or policy shifts. By leveraging social media data, news articles, and other textual sources, we aim to uncover how these funding changes are perceived by various stakeholders — including American citizens, government officials, development workers, and beneficiaries in aid-receiving countries such as Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we perform sentiment classification and thematic analysis to better understand the emotional tone, concerns, and priorities reflected in public discourse. The findings from this analysis can offer valuable insights into the social and geopolitical implications of foreign aid decisions and their real-world human impact.\n"

    "### **PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, shifts in U.S. foreign aid policy—particularly under different presidential administrations—have sparked varying public reactions, especially regarding USAID’s role in Kenya and across Africa. While news media and online communities like Reddit reflect public sentiment on these changes, there is limited structured analysis of how people perceive USAID's presence, impact, and funding shifts over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of insight poses a challenge for stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, development partners, NGOs) who need to understand community perceptions to align strategies, counter misinformation, and strengthen trust. There is, therefore, a need to systematically analyze and compare public sentiment toward USAID across social media and mainstream news platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **OJECTIVES**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conduct sentiment analysis** using tools like VADER, TextBlob, or spaCy to classify posts and articles as positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare sentiment trends** across Reddit and news platforms to identify spikes, policy-driven reactions, or framing differences over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize and report insights** using graphs, word clouds, and dashboards that highlight the tone and evolution of public opinion on USAID in Kenya.\n",
