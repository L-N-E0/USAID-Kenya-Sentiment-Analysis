    "**USAID FUNDING SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS**\n",
    "\n",
    "**INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plays a pivotal role in supporting global development through strategic funding initiatives. In recent years, discussions around the withdrawal or reduction of USAID funding have sparked significant public response — both within the United States and in countries that have long relied on this aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to analyze the public sentiment surrounding USAID funding, particularly in relation to controversial political decisions or policy shifts. By leveraging social media data, news articles, and other textual sources, we aim to uncover how these funding changes are perceived by various stakeholders — including American citizens, government officials, development workers, and beneficiaries in aid-receiving countries such as Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we perform sentiment classification and thematic analysis to better understand the emotional tone, concerns, and priorities reflected in public discourse. The findings from this analysis can offer valuable insights into the social and geopolitical implications of foreign aid decisions and their real-world human impact.\n"
