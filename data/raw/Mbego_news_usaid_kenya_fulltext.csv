President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk celebrated their efforts to slash federal spending before Musk stepped away from his White House work. Musk wore a black DOGE hat over a bruised right eye that he blamed on his young son’s punch. That was May 30 in the Oval Office. Days later, the two billionaires were punching at each other on the social media platforms they own.

Their fight began over federal tax and spending legislation, with Musk calling a Trump-backed bill “a disgusting abomination” and Trump saying he was “very disappointed” with Musk. Soon, Musk claimed credit for Trump and Republicans winning in 2024, and Trump threatened to cut off Musk’s companies’ federal contracts.

I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025

The public display of animosity called into question the fate of months of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) work.

Under Musk’s oversight and with Trump’s approval, DOGE axed billions of dollars in grants for state health departments and scientific research. It gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers. It all but shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the decades-old department that provides food and healthcare to people in other countries.

Still, as Musk ended his work with DOGE, it was clear that the group’s cost-cutting achievements fell short of Musk’s goals. A week before Trump won his second term, Musk said he expected to cut “at least $2 trillion”, without identifying a timeframe for doing it. He later lowered that to $1 trillion.

But both figures were wildly unrealistic. Even if Musk could have eliminated every dollar of non-defence discretionary spending – everything from air traffic control, medical research, federal prosecutors and prisons to border control, US embassies and national parks – he wouldn’t have reached his $1 trillion goal.

As of early June, DOGE’s online “wall of receipts” accounting of federal dollars cut said that the government had cut $180 billion. But analyses by PolitiFact, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the conservative American Enterprise Institute showed that the tallies Musk provided were flawed. And total 2025 federal spending under Trump has continued to grow.

Nat Malkus, an education policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said DOGE’s cuts showed an “appetite for recklessness”, and its error and exaggeration-filled wall of receipts provided “ample grounds for scepticism” about its accuracy. “Beyond that, the receipts only cover a fraction of their actions, making their accomplishments and savings impossible to verify,” Malkus said.

Savings amount unclear

DOGE’s “wall of receipts” reported that the $180bn savings represented a combination of actions, including lease and grant cancellations, “fraud and improper payment deletion” and eliminating employees.

During their May 30 news conference, Musk predicted savings would rise to $1 trillion, but their public dispute made DOGE’s future more uncertain. A few top lieutenants had already departed; dozens of DOGE employees remained.

DOGE says its wall of receipts is incomplete: “We are working to upload all of our receipts in a digestible and transparent manner consistent with applicable rules and regulations,” the website says, calling its list “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30 percent of total savings.”

And it has errors. For example, DOGE said it would save $740,457 by ending a lease that housed records for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. But the federal government had already planned to end that lease in 2025. The property’s leasing company told PolitiFact on May 30 that the government is still using the property and paying rent. If the government leaves before September, it will have to continue paying under the lease’s terms, unless another tenant is secured.

Some of DOGE’s contract and grant cancellations are being litigated, and the government may ultimately be required to fulfil them.

“Even for grants and contracts that DOGE cut, the claimed savings may never be realised,” Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said.

The $180bn figure was aspirational and projected, PolitiFact found.

“Itemised, verifiable cuts – those with receipts – are roughly half that amount,” said Dominik Lett, a budget policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Of those itemised cuts, there are numerous clerical errors and inflated savings values.”

Government officials did not respond to our questions about how many federal employees were cut. The New York Times reported that as of May 12, the government reduced its workforce by roughly 135,000, including cuts and buyouts. That amounts to a tiny portion of the 2.4 million federal workforce, with similarly modest savings in salaries. The Reuters news agency, counting early retirements in addition to buyouts and firings, said the tally was 260,000.

When 75,000 employees who took buyouts come off the books in October, that will save about $10bn a year, or 0.1 percent of federal spending, Jessica Riedl, an expert on the federal budget at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in an essay for The Atlantic. (Trump quoted the 75,000 figure during his May 30 news conference.) But the government could end up hiring contractors to perform some of that work, further shrinking those savings.

Not every agency or department faced widespread cuts. The Justice Department’s staffing was reduced by about 1 percent, The New York Times found. But nearly all employees were cut at USAID and AmeriCorps. Nearly half of the Education Department’s staff were cut.

Federal government spending continues to rise. In April 2025, total spending was $594bn, $27bn more than in April 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s a 5 percent increase. The largest spending decrease – $17bn – came in the Department of Education, which Trump promised to eliminate. But Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid outlays rose, as did some department spending, including in agriculture and defence.

Some of DOGE’s line items show savings of zero dollars, which a White House spokesperson said means that the money has been spent but won’t be renewed, such as for news subscriptions or training. It also showed some negative values for grants; a State Department spokesperson said they were caused by an input error that had since been corrected, although it was still on the site as of about noon ET (16:00 GMT) on June 5.

It’s unclear whether DOGE’s spending cuts will be permanent because federal law requires the executive branch to send proposed cuts, known as “rescissions”, to Congress for approval. The White House on June 3 sent a $9.4bn package of rescission cuts to Congress that includes cutting foreign aid.

“DOGE can kill projects, but the spending doesn’t become savings until Congress votes to ‘unspend’ the money,” Malkus said.

DOGE also increased some government costs, such as those incurred when defending against lawsuits.

DOGE abruptly cut programmes but failed to find mass fraud

DOGE left no state untouched, according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It terminated leases and grants to health departments, universities and volunteer programmes across the country.

DOGE listed terminations of hundreds of millions of dollars in state health department grants, which represented some of the group’s biggest “savings”. These cuts targeted health departments in states including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

The administration said the cuts mostly affected money used for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Twenty-three states challenged the cuts in a lawsuit that argued the move caused states “tremendous chaos” including “immediate harm to public health initiatives and the termination of large numbers of state and local public health employees and contractors”. In mid-May, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the federal government to release the frozen funding.

“These funds support state and local health departments in combatting infectious diseases, as well as offering mental health services and funding addiction treatment programmes,” said Lynn Sutfin, a state Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson in Michigan, one of the state plaintiffs.

Other cuts included nearly $400m in AmeriCorps grants, resulting in the terminations of more than 32,000 AmeriCorps members and volunteers, and the historic gutting of USAID, the nation’s federal international humanitarian and development arm.

One local AmeriCorps programme, Serve Louisiana, filed a lawsuit to stop cuts to its $700,000 grant that aimed to place 37 workers with Louisiana nonprofits, including a food bank, a library and Boys and Girls Clubs, through August. As of June 2, the lawsuit was ongoing.

“Our nonprofit partners are now scrambling to adapt without the help they counted on,” Serve Louisiana Executive Director Lisa Moore said.

USAID programmes aimed to reduce hunger and disease and promote democracy globally. In fiscal year 2024, USAID made up 0.3 percent of the federal budget. Weeks after Trump’s inauguration, DOGE froze nearly all of USAID’s spending and terminated nearly all employees.

Musk boasted on February 3 that DOGE had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, and two weeks later he wielded a chainsaw at a conservative political event to symbolise what he said was his attack on federal bureaucracy.

USAID’s dismantling had sprawling global effects.

In Ukraine – the largest recipient of USAID funds since Russia’s 2022 invasion – regional media outlets lost funding and medical charities shuttered programmes that screened for and treated tuberculosis and HIV, NPR reported.

US diplomats in Malawi said US funding cuts to the United Nations World Food Programme increased criminal activity, sexual violence and human trafficking in a large refugee camp, ProPublica reported. American embassy officials in Kenya said funding cuts to refugee camp food programmes led to violent demonstrations, ProPublica said.

People also died because of the chaotic aid disruptions, according to Al Jazeera, NPR, The Associated Press, and other news organisations.

The consequences are still unspooling.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that up to four million people in Africa might die from treatable diseases without USAID funding. Former USAID officials told Reuters that, because of the cuts, food rations worth $98m that could supply 3.5 million people for a month are decaying in warehouses and some are likely to be destroyed. The World Health Organization cautioned in March that USAID cuts could trigger a global increase in tuberculosis cases and deaths.

Musk and Trump said that DOGE would ferret out fraud, too. Government reports predating Trump’s current term show fraud is a real problem, but so far DOGE has not proven that it has recently uncovered mass fraud.

A White House spokesperson said there had been 50 criminal referrals stemming from DOGE’s work and pointed to three individuals charged for voting as a noncitizen in New York or Florida. Statements by federal prosecutors said that DOGE assisted with the cases. Such cases had been prosecuted before DOGE’s creation."

Here is a story showcasing how innovation in Kenya’s electric mobility sector is helping to address real problems where it matters most. Pedestrian-pulled handcarts (called mkokoteni in Kenya) play a crucial role in Kenya, providing a channel for informal traders to get their goods all around from suppliers to marketplaces. The story of Ecomobilus sheds light on the potential for e-mobility to be transformational.

Ecomobilus Technologies Limited is a startup established in 2022 to pursue e-mobility and solar technological engineering projects. The formation of the company arose from a coinciding problem encountered by the founders (Paul Waweru and myself) regarding access to EV replacement batteries for their scooters in the aftermarket both in Kenya and even in the OEM source countries. Initial projects were focused on custom-designed lithium battery packs for aftermarket replacement for their customers. They achieved this by use of second-life lithium cells recovered selectively from discarded laptop batteries, most of which had over 80% integrity capacity.

The battery packs went a long way in providing affordable lithium batteries for e-mobility in Kenya for its early adopters. Then came the demand of those wishing to convert from gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs. In response to this, we undertook our first successful ICE to EV conversion of a motorcycle, which resulted in a series of conversions of several versions of motorcycles and quadbikes, with the patronage of Zetech University and Chandaria Business Incubation Centre, Kenyatta University. Lithium cells that could not provide sufficient capacity for EVs, but with at least 70% integrity capacity, were used to build solar charged power stations for use by small businesses such as saloons and barbershops at less than 30% the cost of an equivalent OEM product.

It was during this process that the company started getting media highlights from Kenya and internationally. This led us to receive a stream of invites for attendance at EV showcasing events sometimes supporting other existing EV companies that had a gap in their technical capacity. During these events, we met many enthusiasts who made requests for different EV products and lithium battery solutions. One of the clients was Sow Precise, who were carrying out a project dubbed “SunRider” to provide mobile irrigation as a service in a model akin to the “Uber” hailing cab service. They were operating a farm in Mbeere South, Embu County, approximately 150 km from the capital city of Kenya, Nairobi.

From the model farm, they would showcase effective irrigation models using solar, and from there provide solar powered irrigation services to their customers using a manual pedestrian-pulled handcart (called mkokoteni in Kenya) to move the irrigation implements from farm to farm in areas of 10 km square. This was not only tiresome but unsustainable because they could only manage to deliver the service to very few farms due to the time consumed pulling the mkokoteni. When they consulted us, we decided to take up the project of building for them an electric mkokoteni, that we dubbed emKoko.

The specifications for the emKoko were supposed to be 400kg LW, 4ft by 7ft, with a 48V 45Ah lithium battery and a 3kW motor including a rider seat. We commenced the project in mid-Aug 2024. This project posed to us a number of challenges. The biggest challenge was that we had no replica project in our view to benchmark from. This called for a lot of ingenuity and creativity. We modeled it after the traditional mkokoteni, except we had to consider ease of maneuverability in the farm, requiring good ground clearance, torque, off-road tackling, and all necessary rugged application — yet reliable enough to avoid challenges of sending our engineers to the distant field support. We, therefore, settled for a rear-seat-driven model similar to a loader and made some battery upgrades to 72V45AH to give it more muscle energy for 0.5T payload.

The engineers took a modular design of a separate chassis and the cargo bed, with a focus on coming up with a CKD product. The construction and assembly took us approximately 1 month, and few days were spent on wiring and other finishes. Our biggest challenge was cost because we often had to re-work a number of our designs at our cost since we had to deliver the best at the end of the day. As the work progressed, enthusiasm was very high, with our engineers working into nights and weekends and holding numerous consultative meetings in-house and with engineers drawn from other EV companies in Kenya, who would pay regular visits to assess our progress and give useful insights.

Finally, the end of September 2024 delivered our initial MVP and we proceeded with its final reviews and reworks to deliver the complete unit in the first week of October 2024. We shipped it on lorry to the client and went to its launch on 7th October 2024, with the occasion graced by the USAID Mission Director for Kenya and East Africa, David Gosney. Our profound gratitude goes to Ms Linda Kamau and the team of Sow Precise for believing in us and giving a platform to realize the first functional electric handcart in Kenya and in this region. Also, much thanks go to our engineering team, their friends, and the engineering fraternity (including EnviroServe) who made different contributions to the project, and to the entire Ecomobilus team. We now look forward to replicating this vehicle for all of Africa, where movement of heavy loads by human or animal-pulled carts is common in both cities and rural areas.

We are glad to partner with any organizations and entities who can extend funding or technical support. We have received numerous enquiries from across Africa, with some asking for several adaptations of the design to suit their countries’ policy limitations on EV design registration requirements. New projects underway include a solarized light car with Murang’a University of Technology, Kenya, and a new triad joint collaboration between Ecomobilus, Murang’a University, and the University of Kigali, Rwanda, for regional EV projects targeting the African markets.

Prof Gitau has made a bold move to resign from full time teaching employment to focus on the daunting task of building this startup. Initial signs are good, although they have not received funding yet. The flow of new orders is convincing and there are several overseas entrants who are courting them for a JV. The company has won several awards so far, including the Africa Green Technology Award at the Connected Africa Summit, 2024; and Zetech University’s Best Innovation in the year 2024."

Series: The End of Aid: Trump Destroyed USAID. What Happens Now? More in this series Caret

American diplomats in at least two countries have recently delivered internal reports to Washington that reflect a grim new reality taking hold abroad: The Trump administration’s sudden withdrawal of foreign aid is bringing about the violence and chaos that many had warned would come.

The vacuum left after the U.S. abandoned its humanitarian commitments has destabilized some of the most fragile locations in the world and thrown refugee camps further into unrest, according to State Department correspondence and notes obtained by ProPublica.

The assessments are not just predictions about the future but detailed accounts of what has already occurred, making them among the first such reports from inside the Trump administration to surface publicly — though experts suspect they will not be the last. The diplomats warned in their correspondence that stopping aid may undermine efforts to combat terrorism.

In the southeastern African country of Malawi, U.S. funding cuts to the United Nations’ World Food Programme have “yielded a sharp increase in criminality, sexual violence, and instances of human trafficking” within a large refugee camp, U.S. embassy officials told the State Department in late April. The world’s largest humanitarian food provider, the WFP projects a 40% decrease in funding compared to last year and has been forced to reduce food rations in Malawi’s sprawling Dzaleka refugee camp by a third.

To the north, the U.S. embassy in Kenya reported that news of funding cuts to refugee camps’ food programs led to violent demonstrations, according to a previously unreported cable from early May. During one protest, police responded with gunfire and wounded four people. Refugees have also died at food distribution centers, the officials wrote in the cable, including a pregnant woman who died under a stampede. Aid workers said they expected more people to get hurt “as vulnerable households become increasingly desperate.”

“It is devastating, but it’s not surprising,” Eric Schwartz, a former State Department assistant secretary and member of the National Security Council during Democratic administrations, told ProPublica. “It’s all what people in the national security community have predicted.”

“I struggle for adjectives to adequately describe the horror that this administration has visited on the world,” Schwartz added. “It keeps me up at night.”

In response to a detailed list of questions, a State Department spokesperson said in an email: “It is grossly misleading to blame unrest and violence around the world on America. No one can reasonably expect the United States to be equipped to feed every person on earth or be responsible for providing medication for every living human.”

The spokesperson also said that “an overwhelming majority” of the WFP programs that the Trump administration inherited, including those in Malawi and Kenya, are still active.

But the U.S. funds the WFP on a yearly basis. For 2025, the Trump administration so far hasn’t approved any money in either country, forcing the organization to drastically slash food programs.

In Kenya, for example, the WFP will cut its rations in June down to 28% — or less than 600 calories a day per person — a low never seen before, the WFP’s Kenya country director Lauren Landis told ProPublica. The WFP’s standard minimum for adults is 2,100 calories per day.

“We are living off the fumes of what was delivered in late 2024 or early 2025,” Landis said. On a recent visit to a facility treating malnourished children younger than 5, she said she saw kids who were “walking skeletons like I haven’t seen in a decade.”

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restore safety and security around the world. At the same time, his administration, working alongside Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, swiftly dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, canceling thousands of government-funded foreign aid programs they considered wasteful. More than 80% of USAID’s operations were terminated, which crippled lifesaving humanitarian efforts around the world.

Musk, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said that DOGE’s cuts to humanitarian aid have targeted fraudulent payments to organizations but are not contributing to widespread deaths. “Show us any evidence whatsoever that that is true,” he said recently. “It’s false.”

For decades, American administrations run by both parties saw humanitarian diplomacy, or “soft power,” as a cost-effective measure to help stabilize volatile but strategically important regions and provide basic needs for people who might otherwise turn to international adversaries. Those investments, experts say, help prevent regional conflict and war that may embroil the U.S. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Jim Mattis, who was defense secretary during Trump’s first administration, told Congress in 2013 when he led U.S. Central Command.

Food insecurity has long been closely linked with regional turmoil. But despite promises from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that lifesaving operations would continue amid widespread cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has terminated funding to WFP for several countries. Nearly 50% of the WFP’s budget came from the U.S. in 2024.

Since February, U.S. officials throughout the developing world have issued urgent warnings forecasting that the Trump administration’s decision to suddenly cut off help to desperate populations could exacerbate humanitarian crises and threaten U.S. national security interests, records show. In one cable, diplomats in the Middle East communicated concerns that stopping aid could empower groups like the Taliban and undermine efforts to address terrorism, the narcotics trade and illegal immigration. The shift may also “significantly de-stabilize the transitioning” region and “only serve to benefit ISIS’ standing,” officials warned in other correspondence. “It could put US troops in the region at risk.”

Embassies in Africa have delivered similar messages. “We are deeply concerned that suddenly discontinuing all USAID counter terrorism-focused stabilization and humanitarian programs in Somalia … will immediately and negatively affect U.S. national security interests,” the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, wrote in February. USAID’s role in helping the military prevent newly liberated territory — “purchased at a high cost of blood and treasure” — from getting back into the hands of terrorists “is indisputable, and irreplaceable,” the officials added.

The embassy in Nigeria described how stop-work orders had caused lapses in oversight that put U.S. resources at risk of being diverted to criminal or terrorist groups. (A February whistleblower complaint alleged USAID-purchased computers were stolen from health centers there.) And U.S. officials said the Kenyan government “faces an impending humanitarian crisis for over 730,000 refugees” without additional resources, as local officials struggle to confront al-Shabaab, a major terrorist threat in the region, while also maintaining security inside the country’s refugee camps.

In early April, Jeremy Lewin — an attorney in his late 20s with no prior government experience who is currently in charge of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance and running USAID operations — ordered the end of WFP grants altogether in more than a dozen countries. (Amid outcry, he later reinstated a few of them.) The State Department spokesperson said the agency was responding on Lewin’s behalf.

In Kenya, the WFP expects a malnutrition crisis after rations are cut to a fourth of the standard minimum, Landis said. She is also concerned about the security of her staff, who already travel with police escorts, given the likelihood that there will be more protests and that al-Shabaab might make further incursions into the camps.

In order for the U.S. to deliver its usual food aid to Kenya by the end of the year, it needed to be put on a boat already, Landis said. That has not happened.

In recent days, South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia have begged a visiting government delegation from the U.S. not to cut food rations any further, according to a cable documenting the visit. Aid workers in another group of camps in North Africa reported that they expect to run out of funding by the end of May for a program that fights malnutrition for 8,600 pregnant and nursing mothers.

Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world, Malawi has been a relative beacon of stability in a region that’s seen numerous civil wars and unrest in recent decades. Yet in early March, officials there warned Washington counterparts that cuts to the more than $300 million USAID planned to provide to the country in aid a year would dramatically increase “the effects of the worsening economy already in motion.”

At the time, 10 employees from a USAID-funded nonprofit had recently shown up unannounced at USAID’s offices in the capital Lilongwe asking for their unpaid wages after the U.S. froze funding. The group left without incident, and it’s unclear if they were paid, but officials reported that they expected countries around the world would face similar issues and were closely monitoring for “increased risks to the safety and security of Embassy personnel.” (Former employees at another nonprofit in a nearby country also raided their organization “out of desperation for not being paid,” according to State Department records.)

An hour’s drive from the nation’s capital, Dzaleka is a former prison that was transformed into a refugee camp in the 1990s to house people fleeing war in neighboring Mozambique. In the decades since, it has ballooned, filling with people running from conflicts in Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. The camp, which was built to hold around 10,000, is now home to more than 55,000 people.

Iradukunda Devota, a refugee from Burundi, came to Malawi when she was 3 and has lived at Dzaleka for 23 years. She now works for Inua Advocacy, which provides legal services and advocates on behalf of refugees in the camp. She said tension is high amid rumors that food and other aid will be cut further. Since 2023, the Malawi government has prohibited refugees from living or working outside the camp, and there has already been an increase in crime and substance abuse after food was cut earlier this year. “This is happening because people are hungry,” Devota told ProPublica. “They have nowhere to turn to.”

Now, the Malawi government is likely to close its borders to refugees in response to the funding crisis and congestion in Dzaleka, the WFP’s country representative told the State Department, according to agency records.

Diplomats continue to warn the Trump administration of even worse to come. The WFP expects to suspend food assistance in Dzaleka entirely in July.

“The WFP anticipates violent protests,” the embassy told State Department officials, “which could potentially embroil host communities and refugees, and targeting of UN and WFP offices when the pipeline eventually breaks.”

The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria’s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.

“Feeding is severely difficult,” said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa — virtually the entire population — rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated “safe zone,” which severely limits farming.

For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.

Programs serving children were hit hard.

Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.

But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.

She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.

“I don’t want to bury another child,” she said.

‘Very traumatic’

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

“Before the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,” said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. “Now my biggest worry is high mortality. We don’t have enough resources to keep up.”

Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.

The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.

“It used to be far less,” said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.

Beyond nutrition

The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.

“Before, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,” said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. “Now, that has stopped.”

Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, “sadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.” He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.

A global problem

The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.

In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with “devastating” effects on the needy, said Frederico João, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.

More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inocêncio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.

What impact are the Trump administration's USAID cuts having on health care in Africa?

For the inhabitants of remote South African villages, getting access to medication is a challenge. HIV patients like 19-year-old Nozuko Majola must travel more than an hour to get the vital antiretroviral medication they need. But it wasn't always like this.

""We used to get the drugs delivered to our homes, but since Donald Trump announced he was cutting aid, the drugs have stopped coming. I'm worried that this service will be canceled altogether,"" Majola told DW.

She is one of an estimated 8 million people living with HIV in South Africa. The country has one of the highest rates of HIV in the world. Another HIV patient, Nozuko Ngaweni, who has been taking antiretroviral medications (ARVs) for decades, now fears for her life.

""When I heard that the US had canceled its aid, I felt like I was dying,"" she said. ""I asked myself: 'Will I get medication next month? I have medication for this month, but what comes after?'""

The US has donated to South Africa's health sector for many decades, primarily to combat HIV/AIDS. In 2023, the US gave the country $400 million (€352 million) in funding.

The US funding cuts to South Africa's HIV/AIDS programs could lead to more than 500,000 deaths over the next decade, the head of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, Linda-Gail Bekker, told reporters in February. After taking office on January 20, President Trump issued an executive order that paused foreign aid assistance for 90 days. The review ended with the decision to dismantle USAID as an independent agency. The administration slashed 90% of foreign contracts and grants funded by the US aid agency.

Such funding cuts have been a blow to many African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is the second-largest recipient of USAID funding worldwide, receiving $12.7 billion (€11.2 billion) in 2024. Up to 4 million additional people could now die from treatable diseases in Africa as a result of the loss of US funding, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

Catastrophic consequences

The pan-African NGO Amref Health Africa, which trains specialists and provides medical care to almost 20 million people a year, lost 20% of its budget primarily due to the US cuts. In Ethiopia, educational programs for thousands of young people have been canceled, while 500,000 tuberculosis screenings could no longer be carried out in Tanzania, according to Amref.

""We are seeing massive gaps in all countries. All sectors where humanitarian aid is needed are affected,"" said Lara Dovifat, head of advocacy at Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontières, MSF) in Germany. In South Sudan, MSF is struggling to respond to a cholera outbreak, due to a shortage of aid workers after USAID-funded clinics were forced to close.

""The consequences are catastrophic,"" Dovifat told DW of the cuts.

Dovifat also points to the example of Somalia: ""The number of malnourished children is rising because so many nutrition centers have had to close.""

Meanwhile, in Sudan, a water supply system that operated with USAID funding was shut down overnight.

Spread of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV

The cut in funding related to the fight against HIV/AIDS is particularly dramatic. The US is no longer funding UNAIDS, the UN's HIV/AIDS funding program that goes to communities around the globe. Some have called the US cuts in aid the biggest blow to the global effort to fight the disease.

In Kenya, funding has gone down from $846 million to just $66 million for 2025. Numerous HIV treatment centers have closed, with up to a million people infected with HIV lacking medication.

Nigeria is also heavily dependent on USAID funding. Although the government was able to release around $3.2 million in US aid for HIV medication, without continued US support, setbacks in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are certain.

To finance the fight against these three infectious diseases, the international community set up the Global Fund in Geneva in 2002. Michael Byrne, head of the Global Fund's technical advice and partnerships department, is especially concerned about the cutbacks in malaria prevention programs.

""If you don't get malaria under control, then it's very likely that there will be a significant resurgence and deaths,"" Byrne told DW. Malaria claims 600,000 lives every year, most of them are children under the age of 5 in Africa, according to the World Health Organization.

'We are losing 10 to 20 years of progress'

MSF's Dovifat also fears the cuts could undo the progress made in the area of disease prevention.

""We are losing 10 to 20 years of progress in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Many programs have been stopped, including programs for tuberculosis and outbreak control,"" she said.

The US is also cutting funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global health partnership that provides vaccines to children in low-income countries. USAID accounts for about 13% of Gavi's budget. As a result, 75 million children are expected to miss routine vaccinations over the next five years, which could result in up to 1.3 million preventable deaths, according to the organization.

Countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where MSF plays a crucial role in providing vaccines in areas with limited access to health care, will be heavily affected by the withdrawal of US funding to Gavi.

Yet, despite the setbacks, Byrne, the head of the Global Fund, remains hopeful about the future. Countries across sub-Saharan Africa have been quick to plan on the national level and come up with domestic funding, he said.

""For example, Uganda and Malawi have issued communiques stating that their countries would step in to fill the gaps,"" he said. ""They have implemented policy measures to support the work of community health workers.""

Many in the sector hope that other countries will not follow the US and cut funds too.

""The situation we find ourselves in now is not just about one country. There has been a trend in this direction for some time,"" Byrne said. ""If we don't get infectious diseases under control, we will have to pay more later — and wealthier countries will feel that too.""

DIKWA, Nigeria (AP) — Under the dappled light of a thatched shelter, Yagana Bulama cradles her surviving infant. The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria’s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.

“Feeding is severely difficult,” said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa — virtually the entire population — rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated “safe zone,” which severely limits farming.

For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.

Programs serving children were hit hard.

Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.

But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.

She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.

“I don’t want to bury another child,” she said.

‘Very traumatic’

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno’s capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama’s surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

U.S. Africa Command, which does everything from helping the Somalian military target strikes on al-Shabaab to sending Army civil affairs soldiers to build schools in Cameroon, is working out what their new role on the continent will look like as the U.S. halts aid that was meant to stabilize those countries and make it easier for them to defend themselves.

“Some things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,” AFRICOM commander Marine Gen. Michael Langley, speaking from the 2025 African Chiefs of Defense Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, told reporters Thursday. “So we're asking you to step up and burden-share with us.”

For two decades, U.S. troops have deployed to Africa for exercises like African Lion and Flintlock, which improve the U.S.’s ability to operate in Africa at the same time as it trains up local militaries to be able to defend themselves against their biggest threats.

“Let me speak plainly about the threats we're facing, especially in the Sahel region—including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger—it is the flash point of prolonged conflict and growing instability,” Langley said. “It is the epicenter of terrorism on the globe.”

ISIS and al-Qaida-affiliated groups are “thriving” in the Sahel, he added. Burkina Faso’s government has lost control of vast swathes of their own territory.

“Extremist groups are gaining ground and also expanding their ambitions,” he said. “Therein lies the threat to the homeland, as they gain in capability and capacity.”

In that vein, the U.S. has for decades worked with those countries to train their militaries as well as provide aid for education, food and clean water, ensuring populations have basic necessities that keep them from turning to terror groups to survive.

Groups like al-Shabaab, al-Qaida’s biggest and most well-funded affiliate, are already anticipating an opportunity to amp up operations as Somalia loses U.S. Agency for International Development funding.

“Well, I'll just say this, what I've seen with al-Shabaab—they're making assumptions that there's going to be gaps in aid in certain regions across Somalia, and there's shadow governments,” Langley said. “They're trying to exploit that scene. But the quicker the federal government of Somalia steps up and goes in those areas—and they're already continuing operations in those areas, so time will tell.”

With that aid pulled, AFRICOM is urging partner nations to step up where the U.S. has fallen back.

“Now, we recognize that direct U.S. assistance must adapt to an updated strategy aligned with national defense priorities,” Langley said. “Our goal is not to do more for Africa. It's to help Africa do more for itself. African nations must assume more responsibility for their security. The U.S. will continue to support, but support will be on our overlapping security interests and must be matched by local leadership.”

U.S. military support will continue to include intelligence sharing, Langley said, as well as partner exercises, the “most credible” way to increase African countries’ military capacity while also benefitting U.S. troops.

At the same time, China can and has stepped in to provide aid to Africa and otherwise fill gaps left by the U.S., though their influence model depends more on lending to African governments.

“Last September at the forum on China and Africa cooperation, Chairman Xi [Jinping] said they're going to step up their engagements across Africa,” Langley said.

African troops attend professional military education programs in Beijing, he said, similarly to the U.S.’s International Military Education Program.

“Then they also said they're going to increase security and training in a number of countries, so they’re trying to replicate what we do,” he said. “They're stepping it up and trying to replicate every type of thing, whether it be advise-and-assist type of training and specialized military domains, or putting on exercises like they did in the fall.”"

The large-scale investment appeal arrives amid growing industry buzz surrounding the concept of regenerative agriculture. It also comes as international development organizations face new funding roadblocks.

In “The Regenerative Coffee Investment Case,” the nonprofit said that transitioning to regenerative agriculture could increase smallholder coffee farmer income by an average of 62%, and boost production and exports by approximately 30%. Additionally, the transition would reduce current greenhouse gas emissions associated with farm activities by 3.5 million tons of CO2e annually, while restoring and protecting natural environments.

“These findings confirm what TechnoServe has observed over decades of working with coffee farmers: Regenerative agriculture is not only good for nature, but essential for smallholder livelihoods and the future of the industry,” Paul Stewart, global coffee director at TechnoServe, said in an announcement of the report. “It’s an investment that pays off for farmers, businesses and the planet.”

The numbers above reflect modeling associated with smallholder farmers in nine key coffee-producing countries — Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Honduras, Indonesia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Peru and Kenya.

The report estimates that investment in smallholder adoption of regenerative agriculture averaging $560 million per year over seven years in seven of these countries — Brazil and Vietnam excluded — would result in $2.6 billion in additional coffee exports, and $2.1 billion in farmer income each year.

The report was supported by Swiss multinational Nestlé and its coffee-focused subsidiary Nespresso, global coffee giant JDE Peet’s, and the nonprofit Rudy & Alice Ramsey Foundation.

The report’s call for a seven-year, $4 billion investment comes at a time when U.S. government-supported aid for coffee sector development projects has essentially come to a halt. USAID, which has been gutted under the Donald Trump administration, has been funding TechnoServe-led projects since at least the 1980s, including multiple coffee sector projects launched since 2020.

The report calls for substantial private-sector investment in regenerative agriculture, as well as collaboration among “investors, industry, government and service providers.” Given its vast scope, the report also suggests that the scale of investments and their impacts will vary based on region and existing practices.

Generally speaking, the report focused on typical, or “archetypal,” smallholder farm scenarios for each of the countries, excluding the kinds of large estate-style farms that account for approximately 20-40% of the world’s coffee production.

In a press release from TechnoServe, representatives of Nestlé and JDE Peet’s each praised their respective companies’ existing sustainability schemes, while signaling support for future investments in regenerative agriculture.

“We’ve experienced first-hand how implementing regenerative practices help farmers tackle long-standing challenges like profitability and climate impact,” Nadia Hoarau-Mwaura, global responsible sourcing director for JDE Peet’s, said. “This detailed study offers a clear, practical path to implementing regenerative agriculture at scale — one that requires industry-wide collaboration. At JDE Peet’s, we are proud to support and help lead this transition.”

Look around Caitlin Tulloch's home in Oakland, California, and it's clear that the world outside the U.S. has made an impression on her.

""This is a really lovely piece of embroidery that I bought in a town called Mae Hong Son in Thailand,"" she says, gesturing to a red tapestry woven through with geometric forms. She has other textiles, too — from Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos and Uzbekistan. Some she's purchased in person while abroad. Others she's received as gifts.

On her office door is a little gold placard that her husband had made for her. It reads: ""Caitlin Tulloch, Grand Poobah of Cost Effectiveness.""

Tulloch is an economist. And cost effectiveness is what she has focused on for more than a decade. She uses data to work towards the biggest humanitarian bang for the buck: saving more lives, educating more children and lifting more people out of poverty as affordably and effectively as possible.

This is the work she'd been doing while on staff at USAID since 2023 when, earlier this year, DOGE and the Trump administration began pausing and then shutting down thousands of the agency's contracts. Funding for most of the foreign aid agency's programs evaporated almost overnight.

""It was all very confusing,"" recalls Tulloch. ""But in a very, very short period of time, what USAID had historically been doing was just wiped off the map.""

Tulloch was let go and reinstated by the agency multiple times before ultimately resigning. It was around that time that she and several colleagues, some of whom had been laid off, went on to create a special kind of matchmaking service. They call themselves Project Resource Optimization (PRO).

The idea was simple — out of the ashes of the dismantling of much of U.S. foreign assistance, Tulloch and her team would guide philanthropists who want to help but are uncertain how to do so. They would offer advice on where to invest their money for the biggest impact.

A most important spreadsheet

Here's how this effort got started.

At first, when USAID was being decimated and Tulloch and her coworkers watched their efforts go up in smoke, she says there was ""a large community of people processing a lot of grief.""

They managed to find ways to take care of one another, even at a distance. The daily texts of cat pictures began in February.

""I think we just needed things to smile at,"" says Tulloch. ""It actually became a very nice routine amongst our team. If something bad would happen, they would be like, 'Well, we need a thread of everyone's pets.' ""

Pretty soon, Tulloch started contemplating what to do next. ""Thinking about what I can do with my skill set to take care of people, improve human welfare,"" she says.

And then, in late February, she got a couple of phone calls from two well-heeled foundations that she'd interacted with previously and that support groups overseas. They were grappling with a conundrum. In a world where the U.S. has now largely retreated from its commitment to foreign aid, they wanted to know how to donate their money to have the greatest impact on saving lives. Of the thousands of programs the agency once supported at a level of some $35 billion , which should these foundations help fund?

""All of a sudden, people are saying, 'Out of all of that, if I have $2 million, if I have $5 million, what should I pick up?,' "" Tulloch recalls.

She decided this was the perfect project to focus on. So she and several colleagues went to ForeignAssistance.gov and downloaded a spreadsheet listing all the foreign aid programs that USAID had been funding. It amounted to 22,724 commitments.

""They're tagged by country and by sector and by purpose and by implementing partner and by funding source,"" says Tulloch. When an NPR reporter visited her in April, she called up the spreadsheet that she and her team assembled to track all these fields and scrolled through the document that now satisfyingly consumes her life.

There are basic sanitation programs in Ghana, tuberculosis control initiatives in Malawi, STD control projects in Nepal, and on and on. Line after line after line.

""Each of these represents an obligation in a particular country,"" Tulloch says. ""It's like a heat map of what was being done, where.""

Tulloch and her small team applied a series of filters to the spreadsheet, trying to hone in on the programs that were the most cost effective and that had the potential to save the most lives. For instance, they removed projects focused on improving the work environment or fostering biodiversity. ""Not because those were bad objectives,"" she says, ""but simply because that wasn't the focus of this initiative."" They also filtered geographically, focusing on lower income countries.

""And we were still at 2,000 rows and $9 billion,"" she says. She thought to herself, ""I don't know what else to filter out here. It's really a terrible set of decisions.""

They then waded through the descriptions for all 2,000 rows and reached out to numerous programs around the world to make sure their funding had indeed been withdrawn — and if so, how urgent their unfinished work was. PRO sent out a survey that asked the program staff to check off which proven lifesaving interventions they were currently delivering and to how many people. Things like emergency food assistance, syphilis detection and treatment, the spraying of insecticide on home surfaces to kill the mosquitoes that spread malaria, and more. PRO then conducted a quick check on the efficiency of that delivery to come up with their short list.

So far, the team has 54 projects totaling almost $96.5 million that they call ""Urgent and Vetted.""

A match made in Mali

When Tulloch first surveyed this list, one ""row"" leapt to the front of the line. ""It's a project in Mali that was delivering treatment for acute malnutrition for children, mostly under 5,"" she says, along with other health issues. The work was being done by the global NGO Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in the middle of an ongoing civil war affecting most of the country.

""So in these conditions, [the people are] unable to produce food,"" says Dr. Geoffray Kakesi Mambweni through an interpreter. He runs the Mali arm of the ALIMA group. ""They're unable to harvest. They're unable to travel because of all these risks that are present.""

toggle caption Moulaye Haidara/ALIMA

One of the most successful programs run by Kakesi's team of 109 people is providing young kids a fortified peanut-based paste called Plumpy'Nut that is extraordinarily effective in treating malnutrition. ""Many of these children would be dead at this stage without this kind of a program,"" he explains.

That's why his team was distressed when, earlier this year, the U.S. government asked them to suspend their work so that an evaluation could be conducted. Kakesi says they were subsequently told by USAID to fire their staff and liquidate their supplies, including fuel and medicines. It wasn't clear whether USAID would restore their award. Ultimately, it was reinstated but the funding will only last until July. And ALIMA wasn't confident the grant would be renewed at that point.

A US State Department spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR: ""USAID's grant with ALIMA in Mali is active and running,"" and added, ""We will continue to make changes as needed.""

""We didn't want ALIMA to be in a position of stop, start, stop, start funding,"" says Tulloch. ""There is still a cliff coming. And there was still an interruption in funds being paid in the meantime that was preventing ALIMA from doing their work.""

This instability is part of the broader foreign aid landscape that she and her colleagues are now navigating. ""We have been chasing a moving target since day one,"" she says. ""It is inherently a very volatile environment in which to be making decisions.""

The PRO team determined that with a relatively small investment, the program could sustain its distribution of life-saving nutritional support to thousands of women and children, independent of U.S. funding decisions. If ALIMA waited too long, however, Tulloch and her colleagues felt it would be almost impossible to resume, given the challenges of operating in a war zone.

So PRO called up the Boston-based CRI Foundation , which funds global health development work in Africa and said they should act now and contribute to the Mali project. PRO was transparent about the possible resumption of USAID funds and the unlikely chances of a grant renewal in July. The possible downside of waiting was just too great in their estimation.

""And so we're now in this kind of matchmaking role,"" says Tulloch.

Kara Weiss, the foundation's executive director, was excited to hear about the opportunity in Mali. Her team had been wondering where to invest once the U.S. cut foreign aid. It had all seemed so impenetrable. So they reached out to other foundations and former USAID colleagues to figure out what to do, which led them to Tulloch.

""To have someone come to you and say, 'Well, we're just gonna go through the entire portfolio and get some answers,' like, yes, please,"" Weiss says. ""It's been a remarkably helpful initiative.""

The foundation wound up contributing $2.5 million to the Mali program — about half of what the group used to receive from USAID over a two year period. Still, the new influx of funds will allow ALIMA to extend some of its most pressing work in the country through mid-2026, independent of a grant renewal by the U.S. government.

""I think it's clear that private philanthropy is not going to be able to fill all the gaps,"" says Weiss. ""But what we can do is staunch the bleeding, keep projects functioning so that it's possible for local organizations or local governments to take them over.""

Tulloch agrees. ""If we all wait until all of the dust settles, it's going to be a worse outcome that we're going to arrive at than if people take some of these bets right now,"" she says. She has found that not all donors are comfortable with contributing to an ecosystem characterized by such uncertainty, but the CRI Foundation was willing to take that risk.

In the meantime, ALIMA was thrilled with the news. ""When I was able to inform our teams who are out in the field that we had finally secured financing,"" says Kakesi, ""it was just so much joy. So this financing really gave us hope. And at the same time, we did have to prioritize because this is indeed more limited funding.""

He says his team will spend the money in the neediest regions of the country.

A closing window

Una Osili , the associate dean at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, finds PRO's matchmaking effort innovative and essential.

""No single actor can solve the scale of problems that the world has to deal with,"" she says, ""whether that's in health care, education, agriculture, energy. And increasingly, we think about blended finance models as well as new forms of capital."" Such funds might come from governments, the private sector and philanthropic interests across the Global North and Global South, she argues.

Osili brings up a standard critique of private global development philanthropy — that it tends to operate at a small scale and does so with minimal coordination with government agencies. By contrast, in her view, the PRO project is harnessing the reams of data that the U.S. government has accumulated over the years to rectify a key ""information asymmetry"" that often plagues donors who don't know how best to make a difference.

In addition, Osili says philanthropy's key advantage is that it's freed from the constraints that bind other entities, including governments. ""Private donors don't have to respond to election cycles,"" says Osili. ""They can work in real time, so philanthropy has flexibility, agility and the ability to essentially experiment.""

The Mali program is one of now 13 matches that the PRO team has helped facilitate so far. And PRO, which is now being hosted by the think tank Center for Global Development , has a singular focus — securing funding for as many programs as they can on that Urgent and Vetted shortlist.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

This matchmaking process, says Tulloch, ""is not intended to be a long-term thing. I think we expect to do this for another four or five weeks. After that, the projects in our database will all largely have closed down. This is very time sensitive.""

Sponsor Message

That's because the window for restarting de-funded projects is closing. Staff will soon go elsewhere, supplies will dry up. Tulloch knows well that most of the projects in that spreadsheet of hers will flatline.

""There's no justice in any of this,"" she says, ""that anybody should have to be sitting here and filtering a spreadsheet in this way as the means of making decisions of such consequence. Not everybody's going to make it.""

""This is not about getting everything we want, making things whole again,"" Tulloch admits. ""I would like to make the world a better and slightly more just place for other people. And that's something we can do, even if it doesn't fix everything.""

""Our members are surviving with grace,"" says Justine Adhiambo Obura, the chairperson of No Sex for Fish.

She's talking about a cooperative of 20 women who did the unthinkable. They are fishmongers from the village of Nduru Beach in Kenya who said no to fishermen who demanded: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

With the support of various charities and programs, these women eventually got their own boats — and hired men to fish for them in Lake Victoria. The name of their group is a testament to their success.

But in the year 2025, their survival is precarious. The No Sex for Fish women are coping with the legacy of disastrous floods that have virtually destroyed their village and disrupted the fishing business. And now they're facing new fears about their health.

Eleven of these women are HIV positive. Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S.

But in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted.

A single mom's story

Rebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place.

Their former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees.

While scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries.

She says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be ""the displacement from my home"" because of the flooding — and earning a living.

Now she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy?

""They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,"" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother.

""We are scared of what the future holds,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

So what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid.

But according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them.

It's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity ""to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.""

The source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and ""took a while to restart.""

What's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback.

""The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,"" the source says.

Sponsor Message

The government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit.

So even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs.

""People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,"" the former PEPFAR employee said. ""But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.""

""There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,"" says Oluoch. ""They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.""

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

In response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that ""PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries.

""All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.""

Erick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government.

""I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,"" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024.

Haunted by a member's death

The women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills.

Rose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are.

Her husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS.

Jack is HIV positive as well. ""I have also been taking my drugs from health center,"" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad.

""I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,"" he says.

Naomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs.

Like most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods.

Adding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, ""My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,"" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills.

""It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,"" she says.

Akoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive.

It is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Theresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. ""The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,"" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties.

And it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. ""Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,"" she says. ""The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.""

Cash aid from table banking

Justine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other.

""We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

""Table banking"" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs.

They meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income.

Alice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need.

But she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. ""The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,"" says Amonde.

In spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors.

Yet it can be hard to hold on to hope.

""We are living a daily nightmare,"" says Rebbeccah Atieno. ""Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.""

Alleged Torture in Tanzania

Two activists from Uganda and Kenya said on Monday that they were sexually assaulted by Tanzanian security forces while detained in the country last month. The two traveled to the country in May to attend the trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu in the capital, Dar es Salaam. The allegations come as Tanzania cracks down on dissent ahead of an October general election, in which Lissu hopes to run. He is being tried on several charges, including treason.

Agather Atuhaire of Uganda and Boniface Mwangi of Kenya were arrested at their hotel on May 19 before being driven to an unknown location, where they say they were tortured and “subjected to unimaginable cruelty” until May 23, according to Amnesty International. Following their detention, the activists said that officials dumped them near their countries’ borders with the country.

Atuhaire said that she was stripped, raped, and smeared with excrement. The entire ordeal was filmed—“to humiliate, instill fear, but also [to] silence you,” she told AFP. “[But] I am not that victim … I am not the one who should be ashamed.” Back home, Atuhaire has also campaigned against the nearly 40-year rule of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

Atuhaire’s and Mwangi’s cases were not isolated events. Former Kenyan Justice Minister Martha Karua was detained at the Dar es Salaam airport on May 19 and subsequently deported from Tanzania; she also sought to attend Lissu’s trial. Karua accused Tanzania’s government of “subverting the law to lock up the main contenders so that they can sail through unopposed” in the election.

“[L]et them not come here to meddle. Let’s not give them a chance,” Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan said at a May 19 event, speaking about activists from other East African countries seeking to visit Tanzania. “I have seen clips circulating on social media criticizing my approach,” she added, “but it is my responsibility to uphold and protect the constitution.”

Lissu leads Tanzania’s main opposition party, Chadema. He was arrested in April after calling for Tanzanians to boycott the October vote; he argued that the elections could not be free or fair as long as Samia directly appoints members of Tanzania’s National Electoral Commission. Lissu has also demanded electoral reforms.

Chadema was subsequently banned from participating in the contest, and Lissu was charged with treason and sedition. The Electoral Commission said that Chadema was barred because it had failed to sign an electoral code of conduct.

Influential Christian faith leaders have faced similar crackdowns for joining calls for electoral reforms. “Arresting people and detaining them does not silence the people’s grievances; it only deepens the divisions and drives people further apart,” Jacob Mameo Ole Paul, an Evangelical Lutheran bishop, said last month.

On Monday, armed police shut down a church in Dar es Salaam after its leader criticized a recent spate of politically motivated abductions. Chadema activist Mdude Nyagali was abducted on May 2 by unidentified assailants; his whereabouts remain unknown. And Lissu survived an assassination attempt in 2017 and then spent several years in exile before returning to Tanzania in 2020.

Samia took office in March 2021 as a transitional leader to finish the term of President John Magufuli, whom many believe died from COVID-19. She earned praise from international rights groups in her first term for her pandemic response and expansion of political freedoms. But critics say that Samia has adopted Magufuli’s authoritarian tactics to ensure her reelection.

Tanzania restricted social media access in May after hackers targeted government accounts on X. Last year, Samia’s administration temporarily suspended online licensing for three major newspapers after they published a cartoon that criticized her over rising forced disappearances in the country. Samia’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi party has governed Tanzania for more than five decades.

Lissu appeared in court on Monday, chanting Chadema’s slogan, “No reforms, No election.” His lawyers have asked the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for help ensuring his release, but the group’s advisory opinions cannot be legally enforced.

What We’re Watching

Western Sahara’s status. The United Kingdom this week joined the United States, France, and Spain in recognizing Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. During a visit to Morocco on Sunday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that he considered the country’s 2007 autonomy proposal “the most credible, viable, and pragmatic basis” for resolving a decades-old dispute over the territory.

The Western Sahara conflict dates back nearly 50 years, to when Spain relinquished territory that it occupied in what was known as Spanish Sahara. Both Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front lay claim to the region, with the latter group seeking independence.

Until recently, most countries abided by a U.N.-backed cease-fire that would see the territory’s fate determined by a future referendum. The French, Spanish, and U.K. announcements have come as Morocco builds a $1.2 billion port in Western Sahara; the statements seemed designed to boost economic ties with Rabat.

The future of Africom. Last week, the United States and Kenya co-hosted a Nairobi meeting of the annual African Chiefs of Defense Conference, which was attended by senior military officials from 37 African countries.

Speaking to reporters in Kenya, U.S. Africa Command (Africom) head Gen. Michael Langley said that networks affiliated with the Islamic State and al Qaeda in the junta-led nations of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali were attempting to gain access to coastal countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast.

“This puts not just African nations at risk, but also increases the chance of threats reaching the U.S. shores,” Langley said.

Under President Donald Trump, the United States is considering merging Africom with its European counterpart to cut bureaucracy, but Langley did not comment specifically on the proposed merger.

Langley has warned that China is “trying to replicate” programs in Africa that were administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. “They’re trying to match what we do. So that’s what we’re seeing as we start to fold in the capabilities of USAID under [the] State Department,” he said to the U.S. Senate in April. “Those capabilities are needed for the U.S. to maintain a strategic advantage over the Chinese Communist Party.”

Arrest in Kenya. Kenyans have denounced the arrest on Friday of Rose Njeri, a software developer who built an app for Kenyans to share views opposing a controversial finance bill that was recently proposed by the government.

Njeri’s site, known as Civic Email, allowed users to directly send their objections to the bill to government departments. Njeri was charged on Tuesday under the controversial 2018 Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act and then released on bail.

The Kenyan government says that the finance bill will increase state revenue by amending various tax laws, including in real estate and digital services. But opponents say the measure will raise the cost of living and erase privacy rights by limiting citizens’ data protections.

Last year, a previous iteration of the bill led to monthlong protests, forcing President William Ruto to withdraw the legislation before its reintroduction this year.

Nigeria’s floods. As of Sunday, flooding caused by heavy rainfall in the central Nigerian town of Mokwa in Niger State had killed more than 200 people and displaced more than 3,000 from their homes. Officials warned that the actual death toll is likely to be higher. Torrential rains started last Wednesday and continued into Thursday.

Nigeria is prone to flooding, in part due to poor drainage infrastructure. The country’s rainy season lasts about six months and began this year in April. Scientists have warned that Nigeria is vulnerable to extreme weather from climate change, including prolonged drought followed by heavy rains.

This Week in Money

Former Mauritanian Finance Minister Sidi Ould Tah was elected on Thursday to head the African Development Bank (ADB). He will take office at a critical time for the continent’s main infrastructure lender.

The United States is the bank’s third-largest shareholder, after Nigeria and Egypt. But Trump has proposed cutting $555 million in support for the ADB, arguing that the bank was “not currently aligned” with his administration’s priorities.

Ould Tah beat four other candidates competing for the job, gaining 76 percent of votes in the third round of the leadership selection contest. He previously served as president of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa for a decade, from 2015 to 2025. His predecessor at the ADB, Nigeria’s Akinwumi Adesina, said that the bank’s capital stands at $318 billion.

At its annual meeting last week, the bank also announced that it would launch an Africa Carbon Support Facility to help governments regulate carbon trading and to boost the supply and demand of carbon credits. The carbon credits would allow foreign companies to offset their emissions in their own countries by planting trees or putting up wind farms in Africa.

Carbon credits are not without controversy, however: Rights groups allege that the industry has furthered land grabs and the displacement of Indigenous populations across Africa. Scientists also say that carbon credits do not reduce emissions and often harm biodiversity.

FP’s Most Read This Week

What We’re Reading

Trump rewrites history. Ghanaian President John Mahama argued in the Guardian last week that Trump’s unfounded claim of white genocide in South Africa “was an insult to all Africans.” Trump is employing historical revisionism to undermine and erase the violence of apartheid, Mahama wrote.

“It is not enough to be affronted by these claims, or to casually dismiss them as untruths. These statements are a clear example of how language can be leveraged to extend the effects of previous injustices,” Mahama wrote. “And it cannot simply be met with silence—not any more.”

Libyan power grab. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh’s heads one of the country’s two rival governments, the U.N.-backed administration in Tripoli. But Dbeibeh’s recent moves to strengthen his government’s position against rival militias culminated in heavy gunfire in the capital last month.

In New Lines Magazine, Emadeddin Badi and Wolfram Lacher argue that by “mobilizing against what they portray as a … power grab, the government’s adversaries are inadvertently shoring up” Dbeibeh’s “faltering support in his hometown.”"

Our “Heads Up” Work

We’ve worked to improve our research insights over the last year by taking a more “heads up” approach—networking with more experts, going on more site visits, incorporating more local knowledge into our analyses. We often say that “reality is complicated,” and we know that spreadsheets and models alone can’t capture the whole story.

This effort is already paying off in meaningful ways. As part of our ongoing work to identify gaps resulting from USAID cuts, our malaria chemoprevention research team was able to quickly contact country-based representatives from multiple organizations who offered candid perspectives on the funding landscape and potential implementers as we investigated a potential grant. These conversations ultimately led us to fund a different organization than we had originally considered, and we’re confident that this decision was better informed as a result.

Another recent example comes from our malaria vector control research team. This spring, they attended the Alliance for Malaria Prevention Annual Partners Meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, which brings together funders, technical experts, and program implementers from around the world working in the malaria net space. In light of recent cuts to US foreign assistance, the meeting offered an opportunity to engage new partners and strengthen existing relationships at a critical moment. These connections deepen our understanding of the evolving challenges in the field, surface insights we might not otherwise access, and help ensure our research remains grounded in real-world implementation.

Our researchers also have several site visits planned for this year, including trips to see programs in action in Côte d’Ivoire, India, Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. Traveling to areas where the programs we fund operate helps us understand realities and challenges that our research might otherwise miss. We’re continuing to invest in this type of work as an important complement to our desk research, and we’re encouraged by the results we’re seeing as we integrate the approaches.

The traditional dominance of the US in shaping trade and aid policies is receding, creating both peril and possibility for African nations. Recent disruptions—from protectionist tariffs launched in Washington to the outsized influence of tech billionaires—have exposed how vulnerable Africa’s economies remain to external decisions. The once-stable antagonistic cooperation between Washington and Beijing, which long shaped the contours of the global order, now appears to be waning. Yet these shocks are also spurring a long-overdue conversation about self-reliance and sovereignty. Can Africa turn a decline in US influence into an opportunity to chart its own course, or will new dependencies simply replace the old ones? US President Donald Trump’s trade wars epitomize the jolts to the system. His administration’s sweeping tariffs did not stop at China—they struck African countries as well, abruptly undercutting the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which for two decades had given African exporters preferential access to US markets. The effects were immediate and painful. In Lesotho, for instance, a flourishing garment industry that depended on tariff-free exports to American retailers suddenly faced levies of up to 50% on its goods. Thousands of factory workers—mostly women—saw their jobs put at risk overnight as orders evaporated and profit margins vanished. In Kenya, flower farmers braced for a 10% tariff hike on horticultural exports, threatening to price them out of the market. These were not mere economic policy shifts—they struck at the livelihoods of households and communities that had pinned their hopes on global trade. Trump’s tariffs on African countries reached as high as 50% on goods from Lesotho, with steep duties also hitting Madagascar, Mauritius, and others. Industries painstakingly built under AGOA’s duty-free framework were thrown into crisis. For African policymakers, the tariff shock was a rude awakening. It exposed how fragile the continent’s place in global trade truly is when a single policy reversal in Washington can upend entire sectors. “Can we continue to rely on the US, or is it time to find a path of our own?” became the question animating high-level discussions across the continent. The call for diversification grew louder. For decades, Africa’s development strategy had been anchored to ties with the US and Europe—ties that now revealed themselves to be tenuous, even illusory. Trump’s protectionism, though damaging in the immediate term, has forced a reckoning: Africa must reduce its overreliance on any single foreign market. If the status quo can no longer be taken for granted, then perhaps this moment of crisis might also serve as a catalyst to imagine a more independent economic future.

When billionaires shape foreign policy Trade is only one side of the coin. Even as African nations grappled with tariff whiplash, a new challenge to their sovereignty has emerged—driven by powerful private actors like Elon Musk, the tech magnate-turned-policymaker. Under the auspices of a Trump-era initiative tellingly dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk spearheaded an aggressive campaign to slash what he considered “wasteful” federal spending, including US foreign aid. In an unprecedented arrangement, the billionaire was effectively handed the reins to remold parts of the US government’s role abroad. One of Musk’s prime targets, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has long provided development assistance to African countries. Musk’s cost-cutting crusade quickly translated into severe aid reductions. Programs that had been funding health clinics, schools, and infrastructure across Africa were abruptly scaled back or terminated. The consequences have been dire. In March, the World Health Organization warned that the US decision to “pause” foreign aid deliveries had “substantially disrupted” the supply of HIV/AIDS medications in at least eight countries, including Kenya, Lesotho, and South Sudan—nations that could run out of life-saving treatments within months. Decades of progress against the HIV epidemic now risk unraveling, with officials fearing as many as 10 million additional infections and three million deaths if these disruptions continue. In Uganda, which relies heavily on US-funded HIV programs, clinics have already begun rationing antiretroviral drugs—a grim step backward into crisis. These cuts are more than just numbers on a budget sheet; they are measured in human lives, as the US retreat from foreign aid, led by Trump and Musk, has gutted support for some of the most vulnerable populations. What makes this scenario especially unsettling for Africa is the erosion of accountability that comes with private influence over public policy. Musk is an unelected actor wielding outsized power: decisions made in a Silicon Valley boardroom—or an Oval Office backchannel—can determine whether a village clinic in Mali stays open, a clean water project in Kenya dries up, or maternal health programs in Ethiopia are shuttered. This trend, in which billionaire “diplomats” shape the destinies of nations, raises urgent questions about democratic oversight and sovereignty. Who ultimately holds the reins when development priorities can be reset on a whim by corporate titans? For African states used to negotiating with official departments and diplomats, the new paradigm is disorienting. It’s no longer just Washington’s whims they must navigate, but those of individuals operating far outside any diplomatic framework. Musk’s influence is a harbinger of a world where private wealth dictates the terms of global governance—often sidelining the governments of the very countries most affected. The convergence of Trump’s tariff nationalism and Musk’s corporate-driven agenda lays bare a hard truth: Africa’s economic fortunes are still far too subject to decisions made elsewhere, for interests other than Africa’s own. Whether it’s a US president pursuing an “America First” trade policy or a tech CEO advancing a technocratic vision of efficiency, the result for Africa is the same: loss of agency. Each has challenged African leaders to ask: Are we masters of our own fate, or merely pawns in someone else’s game? Yet amid these challenges, a cautious sense of empowerment is emerging. By exposing the pitfalls of dependence, Trump and Musk may have inadvertently done Africa a favor. They have made it impossible to ignore the structural vulnerabilities that have long been apparent. As one pillar of external support after another collapses, African nations are being forced to accelerate conversations about self-sufficiency and regional integration that have simmered for years.

New partners, old risks If the US is stepping back—or pushing Africa away—who will fill the void? One obvious answer is China. In the past two decades, China’s presence in Africa has grown from a curiosity to a cornerstone of the continent’s external relations. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing has poured money into highways in Kenya, railways in Ethiopia, ports in Tanzania, and beyond. For many African governments, China’s willingness to finance big-ticket infrastructure has been a godsend, especially as Western aid and investment waver. In the wake of Trump’s tariff shock, analysts predicted that Beijing would waste no time presenting itself as a more stable, “rules-based” partner—one that wouldn’t yank away market access on short notice. China has long emphasized its commitment to consistent engagement, a message likely to push countries even closer to its orbit. But if US influence came with strings, so too does China’s. Critics warn that BRI projects can devolve into “debt-trap diplomacy,” a new form of economic subjugation by another name. The formula is familiar: Chinese state banks offer huge loans for infrastructure, African states eagerly accept, and when repayment becomes impossible, Beijing gains leverage—whether in the form of control over strategic assets or greater influence over domestic policymaking. Already, countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka—a cautionary tale outside Africa—have struggled with unsustainable debt linked to Chinese funding. Critics argue the BRI functions as a development scheme that saddles countries with unaffordable loans, leaving them vulnerable to coercion and weakening their sovereignty. From an African perspective, the picture is more nuanced. Leaders like South African President Cyril Ramaphosa have pushed back on the “debt trap” narrative, arguing that Chinese investment, if managed prudently, fills crucial development gaps and that African states are not passive victims. Chinese capital has indeed built roads, power grids, and other infrastructure where it was desperately needed. And unlike Western aid, it often comes with fewer lectures on governance or human rights. Still, the long-term implications must be weighed. Who owns the mines and minerals after the deals are signed? Are local workers and businesses benefiting, or just foreign contractors? If a railway is built with Chinese loans and operated by a Chinese firm, how much of the profit stays in Africa? These questions strike at the heart of sovereignty: can Africa truly be sovereign if its most critical assets are externally controlled, whether by Washington or Beijing? The same caution applies to other emerging partners. For example, India, Turkey, and the Gulf states have also increased trade and investment across Africa in recent years. They offer African governments more diplomatic options and the promise of diversified economic ties. In theory, this competition for African markets could increase African leverage—a chance to play suitors off one another for better terms. But in practice, it could also become a race to the bottom. Without clear-eyed strategies and strong negotiating positions, African nations risk simply replacing one set of extractive arrangements with another. Ultimately, diversifying external relationships—whether through trade deals with Asia or South-South cooperation—is a necessary strategy, but not a sufficient one. True autonomy won’t come from swapping patrons. It will come from reducing the need for patrons altogether.

The promise of AfCFTA and regional integration One bright avenue for reducing external dependence is strengthening ties within Africa itself. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), operational since 2021, is an ambitious project aiming to knit together 54 African countries into a single market of 1.4 billion people with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion. It represents Africa’s boldest effort yet to boost intra-continental commerce, which currently makes up only about 15% of Africa’s trade, compared to over 60% in Asia and 70% in Europe. The logic is straightforward: if African countries trade more with each other, they will be less beholden to external markets. A more self-contained African economy could better withstand global shocks—whether financial crises, pandemics, or the whims of foreign leaders—because it would spread risk across a broader internal base. Early analyses of AfCFTA’s potential are encouraging. The World Bank estimates that by 2035, full implementation of AfCFTA could raise Africa’s exports by 32% and lift tens of millions of people out of poverty. It could also make the continent far more attractive to investment in manufacturing and services, as companies tap into economies of scale beyond their home country. In short, AfCFTA aspires to do nothing less than reconfigure the African economy—shifting it from an exporter of raw commodities into a diversified production base serving African consumers. Over time, this could help break the historic pattern where Africa sends out unprocessed minerals and crops and buys back finished goods at a premium, a cycle that has perpetuated underdevelopment since colonial times. However, turning the paper agreements of AfCFTA into real commerce on the ground is a formidable challenge. Infrastructure gaps are a major bottleneck—you can’t trade if you can’t transport goods efficiently from an inland factory to a port or land border. Many African countries still lack reliable roads, railways, and electricity to support industrial growth. Customs procedures and regulatory standards need harmonization to ease the passage of goods. And some countries remain wary that opening up their markets might undercut local industries in the short term. Implementing AfCFTA will require not just political will but also significant investment in connectivity and competitiveness. It is encouraging that even amidst these concerns, regional blocs and governments are actively working on these issues—from new cross-border highway projects to unified customs protocols. The direction is clear: Africa sees regional integration as key to its economic future, even if the journey will be long.

Beyond dependency Whether dealing with Washington, Beijing, or any other capital, one theme becomes apparent: Africa’s leverage will ultimately depend on its internal strength. Diversifying trade partners and signing new deals can only go so far if underlying vulnerabilities persist. The most fundamental question is one Africans are increasingly posing to themselves: What would it take to truly stand on our own feet? The answers usually begin at home. Stronger institutions, better infrastructure, and skilled human capital are the foundation of any self-sufficient economy. For Africa to negotiate as an equal on the world stage, it needs capable states that can deliver public goods and foster an environment where domestic and foreign businesses can thrive. This means tackling everything from corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency to gaps in education and technology. It means investing in roads, ports, power grids, and internet bandwidth that connect African producers with African consumers. It also means nurturing local entrepreneurship and industry, so that value is added within Africa rather than overseas. As long as African countries primarily export raw minerals or crude oil and import the finished electronics, machinery, and processed foods they consume, they will remain at the mercy of external price swings and foreign suppliers. Consider the stark reality: many African economies are still overly dependent on a narrow range of commodity exports—whether it’s oil in Nigeria, copper in Zambia, coffee in Ethiopia, or cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire. This makes them extremely vulnerable to global market fluctuations and leaves them with little bargaining power. Breaking out of that pattern requires deliberate strategy. Governments might, for example, incentivize the growth of local agro-processing industries, so coffee and cashew nuts are roasted and packaged in Africa rather than exported raw. Or they might invest in mineral refining and battery manufacturing at home to climb up the value chain from just mining cobalt or lithium. Some of this is already happening: Rwanda and Ghana have begun processing more of their minerals locally, and Kenya has nurtured a booming tech sector dubbed the “Silicon Savannah.” But scaling these successes across the continent is the challenge ahead. Reimagining Africa’s role in the global economy also requires a shift in mindset. For too long, the focus has been on attracting foreign aid and foreign investment as the primary drivers of development. This often meant tailoring policies to please donors or multinational corporations, sometimes at the expense of nurturing domestic capacity. Now, a new generation of thinkers and leaders is emphasizing build your own over beggar thy neighbor—the essence being that aid can only ever be a stopgap; real wealth comes from productive economies, not perpetual assistance. This perspective doesn’t reject globalization; rather, it seeks to engage on Africa’s terms. It’s about creating the conditions where African nations can engage in trade not as junior partners competing mainly on low wages or raw materials, but as equal players offering competitive industries and innovation. None of this is easy. The road to true economic sovereignty is long and complex, and progress will be measured in years, if not decades. There will be setbacks and compromises. In the near term, African governments must still contend with external pressures—whether it’s negotiating debt relief with Chinese banks, haggling over trade terms with Europe, or managing the fallout of US policy shifts. Globalization is not going away, and interdependence is a reality. The goal, however, is to reshape that interdependence into a healthier form—one where Africa is not a passive recipient but an active shaper of global norms and networks. What might that look like in practice? It could include steps such as strengthening governance and the rule of law to ensure that agreements are transparent and resources—whether aid or revenue—are managed responsibly, reducing opportunities for foreign exploitation of instability. Investing in education and skills would equip Africa’s massive youth population to drive the industries of the future, from agribusiness and manufacturing to digital services, rather than relying on expatriate expertise. Developing critical infrastructure—such as highways, ports, rail corridors, and power pools—would prioritize projects that connect African economies to each other and enable local businesses to become more competitive. Fostering entrepreneurship and innovation by supporting small and medium enterprises, start-ups, and research could unlock homegrown solutions and diversify the economic base. These initiatives, many of which are underway to varying degrees, would help build a resilient foundation. Only on such a foundation can Africa truly mitigate the whims of external forces—be it a trade war, an aid cutoff, or a global recession."

England

+ Football Association bars trans women from women’s soccer after court ruling

Starting June 1, trans women will be banned from playing in women’s soccer leagues in England, following a ruling by the UK Supreme Court that alters the legal definition of “woman” to being based on “biological sex.” The Football Association (FA) said the policy shift was legally required and will apply across both amateur and professional levels.

The ruling has prompted other UK sports bodies to follow suit. The Scottish FA has announced a similar restriction for the upcoming season, aligning with a broader global trend that has seen World Athletics and World Aquatics organizations impose bans on trans women in elite women’s sports.

LGBTQ+ advocates, including Pride Sports, condemned the decision as discriminatory, noting that fewer than 30 trans women currently play in UK women’s leagues, without issue. “Within weeks, they will lose not just their familiar place in football but the many physical and mental health benefits that come from being part of a welcoming team environment,” the group stated.

Togo

+ First all-women electric vehicle assembly line in Togo

One Africa’s leading electric vehicle (EV) companies, Spiro, has launched an all–women assembly line in Togo–a groundbreaking move for the African EV industry. Women will now lead daily motor and charger production, receiving specialized training in manufacturing. In a sector historically dominated by men, Sprio’s initiative not only breaks the barriers, but paves the way for greater inclusivity in tech and manufacturing.

“This initiative underscores Spiro’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and women’s empowerment while addressing Africa’s urgent infrastructure needs for electric mobility,” the company told the Kenya Times.

South Korea

+ Samsung under fire for failing women in the boardroom

Samsung is facing mounting criticism over its failure to appoint women to leadership roles, with shareholders calling out the company at its annual meeting for having no female internal board members. Only two women serve as external directors, highlighting the stark gender gap in one of South Korea’s most powerful corporations.

The tech giant is not alone. Among South Korea’s 30 largest companies, there are just 25 women directors in total. Hyundai named its first female internal director only in 2021, and LG Electronics has none. The country ranks second-to-last in the OECD’s 2025 “glass ceiling index,” above only Japan.

Women in South Korea face persistent discrimination even when applying for ordinary jobs. CNN recently reported a hiring manager telling a female applicant, “Women aren’t fit to work in sales.”

Samsung, meanwhile, has focused on initiatives like foreign language training and its Generation17 partnership with the UN, which supports youth-led work on global issues including gender equality. But critics say symbolic perks and CSR programs can’t substitute for real structural change in corporate governance.

Iran

+ 2024 femicide report shows surge in violence

StopFemicideIran (SFI) has released a preview of its 2024 report, exposing a troubling surge in femicides across Iran. The report offers a detailed analysis of the victims, methods of violence used and the societal factors fueling these crimes. Launched in 2020 by the Alliance for Rights of All Minorities in the wake of 14-year-old Romina Ashrafi’s murder, SFI seeks to raise global awareness about the ongoing crisis of violence against women in Iran.

The 26-page report documents a staggering 172 femicides—marking a 16 percent increase from the previous year. This translates to one murder approximately every other day, and includes 31 state-sponsored executions of women. Over one-third of the victims were between the ages of 15 and 35, with the youngest just two months old. The report also underscores the brutal nature of many of these killings and the alarming frequency of violence perpetrated within families.

SFI also highlighted the devastating impact on children and communities left behind. Through documentation, education and grassroots empowerment, the initiative aims to combat femicide and promote women’s rights in Iran. “We must continue to work together to break the cycle of violence and ensure that these women’s lives are not forgotten,” said Marjan Keypour, founder and director of StopFemicideIran.

United Arab Emirates

+ Region’s first all-female supercar club breaks stereotypes on the open road

In a region long seen as a man’s world when it comes to cars, the Arabian Gazelles are rewriting the rules. Founded in 2017 by Hanan Mazouzi Sobati, the UAE-based club is the Middle East’s first all-women supercar owners group — high-performance luxury cars built for speed and spectacle — and it’s growing fast. Earlier this month, 30 women from the UAE and beyond hit the highways in a four-day rally across the Emirates, driving Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and McLarens.

Mazouzi Sobati, a lifelong car enthusiast, created the club to challenge the automotive world’s exclusion of women. She said she was tired of brands only inviting men to track days and promotional events — often sending invitations to her husband, not her. “We don’t wait for a seat at the table,” she said. “If the seat is not available, we create the table and we all sit.”

Despite early resistance from car companies, perceptions are shifting. BMW recently invited the group to test-drive vehicles on a racetrack.

The club’s mission goes beyond horsepower. It’s about visibility, autonomy, and belonging. “We want people to stop assuming there’s always a man behind the wheel of a supercar,” Sobati said. For many members, the Gazelles offer not just adrenaline — but empowerment.

Dominican Republic

+ History making bill introduced to reform the DR’s 139-year-old penal code

Dominican Republic Senator Antonio Tavéras Guzmán has introduced a landmark bill to revise the country’s 1884 penal code, proposing exceptions to the country’s total abortion ban in cases of rape, incest, nonviable pregnancies, or threats to the mother’s life. The bill also expands protections for LGBTQ+ individuals and strengthens support for victims of gender-based violence, child abuse and human trafficking.

Currently, abortion is fully criminalized in the DR, with women and girls facing incarceration for seeking care. Taveras’ proposal comes as four competing revisions threaten to maintain the ban, impose harsher penalties—including prison terms of up to 30 years—and weaken protections against gender-based violence and discrimination.

With maternal mortality and teen pregnancy rates among the highest in the region, and abortion the third leading cause of maternal death in the country, the stakes have never been higher. Far-right lawmakers, encouraged by conservative U.S. allies, are aggressively pushing to entrench the current restrictions.

Hundreds of organizations, united under the National Popular Coordinator, the Citizen Forum, and the Coalition for Life and Women’s Rights, have voiced their support for the proposed Penal Code reforms.

Sudan

+ Sudan’s paramilitary’s forces are weaponizing sexual violence

Amnesty International has accused Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of using sexual violence, including gang rape, as a tactic of war amid the country’s ongoing conflict. In a newly released 30-page report, the organization details how RSF fighters have weaponized sexual violence to terrorize and control displaced communities.

The brutal civil war between Sudan’s RSF and the state’s army has lasted nearly two years, killing tens of thousands and displacing over 11 million people. Amnesty found evidence of war crimes committed on both sides, with women and girls suffering widespread sexual violence.

Amnesty interviewed 30 people for the report, many now living in Ugandan refugee camps, who consistently identified RSF fighters as their attackers. Survivors described the profound physical and psychological trauma inflicted, as well as the devastating, lasting toll on their lives, although urgent medical care remains a critical need, cuts to USAID-funded programs have severely restricted access to essential sexual health services.

“The international response to the suffering of Sudanese women and girls has been reprehensible,”said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact. “The world must act to stop the RSF’s atrocities by stemming the flow of weapons into Sudan, pressuring the leadership to end sexual violence, and holding perpetrators including top commanders to account.”

Greece

+ Greece joins call for first female UN Secretary-General

Greece has publicly thrown its support behind the idea of a woman leading the United Nations, saying the “tide is for a woman” as the race to replace António Guterres in 2026 begins to stir. Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, speaking as Greece assumed the rotating presidency of the Security Council in May, told PassBlue that while male candidates may still apply, “the time is long overdue” for a female Secretary-General.

Sekeris also championed the Women, Peace and Security agenda, emphasizing its strategic value amid global instability. Greece is the latest in a growing list of nations voicing support for gender parity in the UN’s highest post, which has never been held by a woman in its 80-year history.

His remarks come as part of what he called a “European spring” at the Council, with Denmark, France, Slovenia, and now Greece forming a rare show of EU unity. While the five permanent members retain veto power, elected members like Greece are increasingly vocal in shaping the institution’s future direction.

The call for a woman leader resonates with advocates pushing for change across the UN system, especially after the General Assembly adopted gender parity targets and amid pressure to make top roles more inclusive. Whether this momentum translates into actual nominations remains to be seen — but the diplomatic drumbeat is growing louder."

The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria’s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.

“Feeding is severely difficult,” said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa — virtually the entire population — rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated “safe zone,” which severely limits farming.

For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.

Programs serving children were hit hard.

Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.

But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.

She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.

“I don’t want to bury another child,” she said.

‘Very traumatic’

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno’s capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama’s surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

“Before the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,” said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. “Now my biggest worry is high mortality. We don’t have enough resources to keep up.”

Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.

The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.

“It used to be far less,” said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.

Beyond nutrition

The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration’s reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.

“Before, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,” said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. “Now, that has stopped.”

Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, “sadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.” He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.

A global problem

The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps’ vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.

In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with “devastating” effects on the needy, said Frederico João, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.

More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique’s health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inocêncio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.

Gates… [+4070 chars]","Bill Gates has urged African leaders to join him in advancing health and development on the continent. He says his foundation will partner with nations putting people's health first.

US billionaire Bill Gates on Tuesday announced that the majority of his philanthropic Gates Foundation's $200 billion (€175 billion) endowment will be spent in Africa over the next two decades.

Gates, who on May 8 said he would wind down the foundation by 2045, made the pledge while addressing African leaders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

""I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa,"" Gates said as he urged leaders to boost health and development through partnership and innovation.

""By unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity… and that path is an exciting thing to be part of,"" Gates told government officials, diplomats and health workers.

Gates makes pitch as US government slashes aid

""Investing in primary healthcare has the greatest impact on health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""With primary healthcare, what we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results. Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference.""

US businessman-philanthropist Gates singled out Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that to his mind show strong leadership fostering innovation. He did not comment on allegations of authoritarianism and rights abuses against the governments of, for example, Ethiopia and Rwanda.

""Our foundation has an increasing commitment to Africa,"" Gates said. ""Our first African office was here in Ethiopia about 13 years ago. Now we have offices in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal. That's a great way for us to strengthen partnerships.""

Gates' pitch comes amid halts to US foreign aid on the advice of US President Donald Trump's donor and budget oversight advisor, Elon Musk — the world's richest man — who bragged of ""feeding USAID to the wood chipper.""

A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet projected that cuts to American spending on PEPFAR — the program to deliver HIV and AIDS relief abroad — could cost the lives of 500,000 children by 2030. The journal Nature suggested a sustained halt to US aid funding could result in some 25 million additional deaths over 15 years.

The Gates Foundation has invested heavily in projects aimed at reducing childhood and maternal deaths; advancing progress on vaccines for infectious disease, such as malaria or HIV; as well as lifting poor populations out of poverty.

The foundation claims that it has contributed to more than 100 innovations that have saved more than 80 million lives, citing partnerships with GAVI and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

More than meets the eye?

Despite his philanthropy, Gates has many critics around the world, increasingly so in Africa. Observers accuse him of trying to expand his economic and political power in the guise of charity. The US journalist Tim Schwab, who wrote The Bill Gates Problem, sees him as a representing philanthrocapitalism, a way of doing philanthropy similarly to how business is done for profit.

A 2022 DW documentary showed how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (as the Gates Foundation used to be called) had become one of the most important promoters of genetic engineering experiments on the African continent, thus inviting criticism that it was playing into the hands of large Western agricultural corporations.

Angolan health expert Domingos Cristovao warns African countries against becoming dependent on private foundations in key areas such as health. They should build ""their own sustainable health structures"" he says, ""without relying on foreign donors.""

Gates says 'rich should do more in philanthropy'

Gates, who made his fortune with the computer software company Microsoft and started the Gates Foundation with his ex-wife, Melinda, has urged other wealthy individuals to spend their money on humanity not just personal possessions.

When recently asked by The New York Times about why he is donating his fortune he first said, ""It makes a big difference to take the money and spend it now versus later,"" pointing to its impact on developments in agriculture and AI.

""What am I going to do?"" he added, ""Just go buy a bunch of boats or something? Go gamble? This money should go back to society in the way that it has the best chance of causing something positive to happen.""

""And I do think good examples influence other people. I think the rich people today should do more philanthropy, and we have some examples of that. And I think the rich people 20 years from now should do more in philanthropy.""

While in Africa, Gates will also meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to talk about AI and health care reform in their respective countries.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), a silent pandemic, widens health inequalities in Africa by disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. With an estimated 255,000 attributable deaths in 2019, it is one of Africa’s leading cause of mortality. Beyond misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, the key drivers of AMR, Africa faces other unique challenges. These include inadequate Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures, poor Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), suboptimal childhood vaccination rates coupled with inadequate health systems and lack of sustainable access to essential and novel antimicrobials and diagnostics. Besides worsening AMR, these factors lead to inappropriate treatment of diseases, and treatment gaps while addressing resistant cases, pushing up mortality rates. Without appropriate, timely interventions, AMR is projected to result in millions of deaths in Africa and cause more than 5% fall in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of low-income countries, by 2050. AMR National Action Plans (NAP) have been developed as strategic documents to address the issue. However, implementation has been impeded by funding gaps as most NAPs are not funded. This is further complicated by a strained health financing landscape with drastic reduction in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) by traditional donor countries.

AMR financing challenges in Africa

AMR is not often perceived as a development issue due to its technical framing and general lack of awareness, resulting in poor domestic funding for interventions. A study on transparency and accountability of AMR NAPs from 15 African countries showed, only one country has made some funding allocation. African countries depend heavily on the global north for the management of maternal and child health, control of infectious diseases and immunization. With the drastic external funding cuts in 2025, implementation of these programs will be affected. Further, an external debt of over $650 billion by the region is forcing nearly 40% of African countries to spend more on debt servicing than healthcare. As focus will shift to these key issues innovative approaches are needed to prioritize AMR.

Innovative financing strategies in AMR

Faced with these challenges, Africa needs to adopt innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the gaps.

Earmarked financing

In earmarked financing, different tiers of government – federal, local or both – earmark an existing or a new revenue stream for a specific cause, in this scenario it can be AMR.

AMR specific taxes and levies: At present, no African country has AMR specific taxes or any fiscal policy in place to tax commercial activities in non-human sectors such as overuse of pesticides that can cause microbial resistance. A few countries have introduced environmental taxes (e.g: carbon emissions levy in South Africa and tax on plastic bags in Senegal) which could be extended to AMR, or taxes imposed on pharmaceutical or health care facility effluents. Similarly the air ticket solidarity levy system in South Korea where approximately $1 is charged on every international flight from the country which is added to the Global Disease Eradication Fund (GDEF) – is another example that can be adopted for AMR initiatives.

Sin tax or pro health tax for AMR: It has been found that higher the tax-to-GDP ratio, the better the country’s ability to spend on public development projects. One of the ways to achieve this is by raising excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol and sugary beverages. A 50% increase in excise taxes on these items will increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.7%, allowing to earmark the additional income for AMR initiatives..

Policy changes on managing finances

Budgetary allocations: One of the key challenges for specific allocation, is the multi sectoral nature of AMR requiring co-ordination among ministries. A whole-of government budgeting approach can be used, where the budget prioritizes programs aligned to national goals and supplemented by periodic spending reviews. This will foster inter-ministerial collaboration, reduce inefficiencies, and improve outcomes. The performance-based budgeting by many African nations and results oriented outcome-based budgeting are some of the strategies. To prioritize AMR in this approach, lobbying is required to bring it high on national goals.

Delegated financing for AMR: The concerned ministries within a country can be lobbied to start an independent statutory organisation, similar to Joint Programme for AIDS support in Uganda, to receive funds from all sectors including private, philanthropic and international organizations, and developing agencies. If the efforts are too cumbersome, the agencies or ministries could create joint account reserved for AMR initiatives.

Development impact bonds (DIBs): Outcome-based financing instruments like DIBs have been successfully tried in poverty-related programs in Kenya and Uganda. In DIBs, private investors provide money upfront, who are compensated by outcome payers based on specific results. In AMR financing, DIBs can support investment-heavy areas like diagnostic capacity strengthening or IPC infrastructure in healthcare facilities. However, countries must be cautious of the pitfalls perceived with vaccine bonds and should put in appropriate protective measures in place.

Regional financing mechanisms

The African Union, with its tremendous convening power, can explore regional financing mechanisms to support its member nations.

Debt swap for AMR programs: In Africa, 768 million people live in countries where interest spending exceeds education or health spending. South Africa, the largest economy in Africa, is having a debt equivalent to three quarters of its entire GDP and is rising. This debt distress can be used favorably to fund AMR interventions and action plans using the debt for development swap concept. AMR should be on the table when any conversation on debt restructuring is taking place in any African nation.

African union pooled AMR fund: African Union can set up a pooled AMR fund like the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund. However, it should not fall into the trap of foreign aid dependence but should be made with the commitment and contributions from the member nations, development banks, regional economic communities and health agencies. Loans at concessional rates or performance-linked grants for AMR can come from such a fund.

Conclusion

The heavy reliance on external sources exposes the continent’s healthcare to the fluctuations and the interests of the international donors. This has led to non-alignment with local priorities, fragmented efforts, and lack of sustainable domestic financing mechanisms. To strengthen the AMR response, Africa should adopt locally driven strategies, reduce dependence on external funding and create a more resilient financing mechanism.

The Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale announced the planned shift during remarks at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on May 25.

The shift would see a range of digital health systems, currently hosted on US-based infrastructure, moved to local servers. These platforms include Kenya Health Information System (KHIS2), Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMFL), Afya KE, KenyaEMR, Chanjo KE, Damu KE, and Kemsa I-LMIS, all developed and maintained with USAID support. They are central to how Kenya tracks diseases, manages patient treatment, produces vaccines, and keeps rural health clinics running.

Kenya’s primary healthcare system would struggle to function without these platforms. Years of underfunding and systemic corruption have left the country heavily reliant on donor support, particularly from USAID. Cuts to aid under President Trump have exposed millions of Kenyans to gaps in essential health services, from HIV treatment to routine vaccinations.

“The recent challenges have underscored the vulnerabilities in our health data infrastructure,” Duale said. “It’s imperative that we invest in secure, locally managed data systems to ensure continuity and resilience in our healthcare delivery.”

Since March, Kenya’s health officials have reported losing access to data following USAID funding cuts and a subsequent shutdown ordered by the Trump administration.

USAID had committed $2.5 billion to Kenya in its 2020–2025 strategic plan, averaging $471 million in funding each year. An estimated 80% of this budget was earmarked for healthcare initiatives, covering areas such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, and vaccination programs.

In May, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) also reported that Kenya could not access data from the Kenya Health Information System, a crucial tool for disease surveillance and health planning.

Kenyan health officials have also warned that USAID cuts have exposed gaps in maintenance and technology, raising concerns about the country’s capacity to monitor public health and respond to outbreaks effectively.

“With donor funds curtailed, these platforms now suffer from maintenance gaps and technology shortages, severely hindering Kenya’s ability to monitor public health trends and respond promptly to emerging crises,” the Ministry said in April.

With Kenya facing budget constraints, it remains unclear how quickly local systems will be rolled out to handle the transition. In February, the Ministry said USAID funding cuts would cause $ 403.8 million (KES 52 billion) in the country’s health budget.

Secretary-General António Guterres will award the honorary prizes, alongside the President of the seventy-ninth session of the General Assembly, Philemon Yang, as part of the annual commemoration marking Nelson Mandela International Day on 18 July under the theme of “It’s still in our hands to combat poverty and inequality”.

“As the United Nations celebrates 80 years, Nelson Mandela’s legacy of reconciliation and transformation continues to inspire and drive us,” Secretary-General António Guterres said. “This year’s Mandela prize winners embody the spirit of unity and possibility — reminding us how we all have the power to shape stronger communities and a better world.”

General Assembly President Philemon Yang, who chaired the 2025 Selection Committee, said: “The 2025 UN Nelson Mandela Prize not only honours the legacy of Madiba, but affirms that the spirit of multilateralism lives through the tireless efforts of its laureates — two individuals whose lives reflect the courage to lead, the humility to serve, and the vision to unite across borders.”

The winners were selected from 331 nominations received for candidates in 66 Member States.

Ms. Reynolds is a Status Treaty member of the Fishing Lake Saulteaux First Nation, in Saskatchewan, Canada. She is known for her development of the Indian Residential School Resolution Health Support programme under the Indian Residential Settlement Agreement and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

“I speak two languages, yet words fail to express my deep gratitude and surprise at receiving the UN Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize. I am truly humbled. Mandela, a figure I’ve long admired for his work in reconciliation and against apartheid, recognized the parallels between his homeland and the struggles of Indigenous peoples. I have always felt a deep kinship with him,” said Ms. Reynolds upon learning she was one of the two 2025 Laureates.

Mr. Odede is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at SHOFCO. He had been a street-child at the age of 10 and lived in the Kibera Slum for 23 years. Today, SHOFCO impacts more than 2.5 million people each year in Kenya by organizing and strengthening community groups across 68 sites and fostering partnerships to deliver essential services to support them. Kennedy/SHOFCO were also recognized with the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour award in 2021.

“I am so humbled. This award is not about me — it is about the power of communities, and the trust put in local leadership,” said Mr. Odede. “Nelson Mandela taught us that dignity and justice begin from the ground up. This recognition affirms what we believe at SHOFCO: the answers to poverty and inequality already exist within the people most affected.”

The winner’s bios are included in this press release.

At the July ceremony, the winners will receive a glass trophy engraved with a quote from Nelson Mandela: “What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others.”

Brenda Reynolds

Brenda Reynolds, a Status Treaty member of the Fishing Lake Saulteaux First Nation, Saskatchewan, brings a lifetime of lived experience, advocacy and professional leadership to the forefront of Indigenous health, mental wellness and reconciliation efforts in Canada and internationally. Her personal journey — from impacts of cultural genocide to a nationally recognized leader in trauma-informed care — has shaped her deep commitment to addressing the intergenerational impacts of the Indian Residential School system and government assimilation policies.

A social worker, Brenda has varied work experiences with First Nation community work, provincial and federal governments. She played a pivotal role in the largest to date court-ordered Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. Her leadership helped establish the Indian Residential School Resolution Health Support Program — a national, culturally grounded mental health initiative. The Resolution Health Support workers became the first trauma responders to the Indian residential school survivors, their families and Canadians. This programme is still funded and active today, noted for its contributions to healing and post-traumatic growth.

In 1988, Brenda worked and supported 17 teen girls who disclosed sexual abuse at Gordon’s Residential School by a staff member. This was the first court case of sexual abuse by an Indian residential school staff member in Saskatchewan. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission later stated that the Gordon’s Indian Residential School has become known as one of the “worst run schools in the entire residential school system”.

Brenda later worked as a special adviser to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where she coordinated survivor support at national events and advised Commissioners on trauma response. Her ability to mediate, de-escalate and lead with compassion earned the praise of law enforcement and event organizers alike.

Brenda’s expertise is sought globally. In 2023, she was invited by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the European Union to share her insights on trauma and cultural genocide. Her doctoral studies in clinical psychology focus on trauma interventions for cultural genocide, further contributing to global academic understanding.

Brenda continues to provide consultation and training across Canada and internationally, bringing clarity and compassion to complex conversations on trauma, reconciliation and healing. She currently resides in Alberta, Canada.

Kennedy Odede

Kennedy Odede is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at SHOFCO, Kenya’s largest grassroots movement, and one of Africa’s most esteemed social entrepreneurs and community organizers. He is best known for his award-winning work to transform the lives of slum residents and direct resources and decision-making power to local community organizations.

Kennedy became a street child at the age of 10 and lived in the Kibera Slum for 23 years. During this time, he experienced extreme poverty first-hand, but also witnessed the palpable hope that persists in slums and recognized that people sought something different for themselves, their families and their communities. Through earning $1 for 10 hours of work at a factory, Kennedy managed to save 20 cents to buy a soccer ball, which he used to bring community members together, and, with that, SHOFCO was born.

Today, SHOFCO impacts more than 2.4 million people each year in Kenya by organizing and strengthening community groups across 68 sites and fostering partnerships to deliver essential services to support them.

In 2024, Kennedy was named one of TIME’s 100 Most Influential People. In addition, he has been appointed by administrator Samantha Power to the USAID Advisory Committee and has served as a Fellow with Humanity in Action, Aspen Institute and Echoing Green. Kennedy is also a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum, an Obama Foundation Africa Leader and a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. Prior to this, he served on the United Nations International Commission for Financing of Global Education Opportunities, and on the Board of Directors of Wesleyan University.

Kennedy is the co-author of the New York Times Best Seller, Find Me Unafraid: Love, Loss and Hope in an African Slum, which he wrote with his wife, Jessica Posner Odede. His work has been featured by President Bill Clinton, and on multiple occasions by Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times.

Kennedy holds a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Wesleyan University in the United States."

Biggest Contributors

The biggest bilateral lender is Saudi Arabia, with Ksh91.45 billion in loans for fuel support, followed by France (Ksh45.82 billion) and Japan (Ksh33.69 billion) for major infrastructure investments.

Additionally, China, which has financed several infrastructure projects in Kenya like the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), ranks fourth.

On the other hand, the United States is the largest grant provider, contributing Ksh20.87 billion to support governance, health, and social programs.

Germany also offers a combination of loans and grants.

The budget also includes financing from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Current External Debt and Expenditure

Between July 2023 and June 2024, Kenya spent Ksh840.73 billion on public debt servicing.

In the first half of the current financial year (2024/25), which began in July 2024, the government paid Ksh585.63 billion in interest, Ksh444.73 billion on domestic debt and Ksh40.90 billion on foreign debt.

Kenya is on course to exceed Ksh1 trillion in total debt interest payments by the end of June 2025.

Moreover, the average monthly interest payment has risen to Ksh83.66 billion, up from approximately Ksh70 billion in the previous fiscal year.

Furthermore, data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and the National Treasury further reveal that gross domestic debt increased from Ksh5.41 trillion in June 2024 to Ksh6.15 trillion by April 17, 2025.

Meanwhile, total public debt, including both domestic and external borrowing, stood at Ksh10.93 trillion as of December 2024, up from Ksh10.56 trillion in June of the same year.

Notably, on February 14, 2025, Kenya’s gross domestic debt surpassed the Ksh6 trillion mark for the first time in history."

However, little evidence exists on the status of FP integration within self-care-oriented DSDM (SC-DSDM). We explored the status of FP integration into SC-DSDM, stakeholders’ perspectives about and barriers to integrating FP into SC-DSDM and suggestions for improving FP integration into SC-DSDM. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in 18 purposely-selected health facilities in 17 districts across four high HIV-prevalence regions between September and October 2022. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with women living with HIV (i.e., clients), receiving ARV drug refills through SC-DSDM, and 47 key informant interviews with selected stakeholders including healthcare providers, district health managers, implementing partner representatives and policymakers. Data were collected on the different forms of FP integration into SC-DSDM; perspectives on integrating FP into SC-DSDM, and barriers to and suggestions for improving FP integration into SC-DSDM. Data were analyzed following a thematic framework approach. Results We found two forms of FP integration into SC-DSDM: a) one-stop center (in which ART and FP services were provided at the same service delivery point) and b) collaboration/referral to another service delivery point. Only four health facilities offered ART and FP services through the one-stop center; the rest of the health facilities referred clients to the maternal and child health/FP clinic or to other health facilities. All categories of stakeholders agreed that the one-stop center is more convenient and less time-consuming since referral to another service delivery point can increase patient waiting time or result in multiple clinic visits if ART and FP services are offered on separate days. Staff shortages, stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, shortage of adequate office space and lack of integrated registers continue to hamper effective integration of FP into SC-DSDM. Conclusion Despite the potential benefits of FP-HIV integration, FP and ART services continue to be offered as stand-alone programs with limited FP integration into SC-DSDM. These findings call for policy guidance from the Ministry of Health in integrating FP into SC-DSDM in Uganda.

Introduction Differentiated ART service delivery (DSD), previously referred to as ‘differentiated HIV care’, is a client-centered approach that simplifies and adapts HIV services in ways that not only meet the HIV clients’ needs but also reduce unnecessary burdens on the health care system [1]. Differentiated ART service delivery has been scaled up in many countries in recent years [2] with the goal of improving efficiencies in HIV care through reduced patients’ waiting time, reduced patients’ visits to the health facilities, and reduced health providers’ workload due to seeing patients less frequently through multi-month dispensing of ARV drugs [3]. As a result, most people living with HIV are now seen by clinicians or visit health facilities less frequently [4–6]. Concurrently, there is a renewed emphasis on ensuring that all women living with HIV (WLHIV) have access to other non-HIV services, including family planning (FP), as part of their HIV care and as an essential pillar in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [7–9]. This renewed emphasis on FP as an essential part of HIV care follows closely on recent calls for more inclusive and patient-centered care for people living with HIV [10,11]. However, WLHIV who visit health facilities to collect their ART do not fully benefit from patient-centered care if they have to return to the same health facility more frequently to receive other non-HIV services, including FP. Clients in DSD models should be supported to use contraceptive methods of their choice and, where ongoing commodities are required, be able to obtain these through their differentiated ART service delivery models (DSDM) [1]. One way in which WLHIV can be supported to access the contraceptive methods that they need when they come for their ARV drug refills is to streamline the schedules for contraception and ART resupplies in such a way that the client can be provided with FP supplies of the same duration as their ART refills [12]. Under an ideal integrated FP and HIV service delivery mechanism, FP and ART care should be provided at the same time, in the same place and, where possible, by the same provider [13]. This can be achieved through different approaches, including use of multi-skilled HIV and FP providers and a one-stop service center within the ART clinic site (or at the community drug distribution point) offering HIV and FP services under one roof [14]. In Tanzania, for example, women in DSDM have access to a full range of contraception options; ART and FP are both offered within the same care and treatment centers [15]. This alignment ensures uninterrupted supply of contraceptives and ART while minimizing visits to the health facility [1]. Similar arrangements can be made for community-based ART delivery approaches, including sending out multi-skilled HIV and FP providers to manage ART refills and FP supplies at the community outreach service delivery points [16]. Similarly, for community group models, provision of FP can be aligned with the scheduled FP refill of the group member who goes to the health facility (or community drug distribution point) to pick ART for the other members [1]. In 2016, Uganda made DSDM a priority in the national HIV prevention, care and treatment guidelines so that HIV service delivery could be more client-centered and scarce resources could be refocused to those most in need [17]. In 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health developed the national policy guidelines and service standards for sexual and reproductive health services and rights (SRHR) [18] that called for integrating STI/HIV and AIDS within SRHR services. However, these guidelines did not include details on how STI/HIV and AIDS integration into SRHR services would be implemented. In tandem with this observation, the Ministry of Health, in 2017, developed DSDM implementation guidelines that were more aligned to HIV service delivery [19]. These guidelines were expected to provide guidance on the integration of FP into the differentiated ART service delivery models. However, until this assessment, there was no formal evaluation to determine if FP integration was well streamlined within the DSDM guidelines, and if so, whether integration of FP into the DSDM was being implemented based on these guidelines. Differentiated ART service delivery is now the primary mode of providing ART refills to people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Uganda with the majority (65.6%) of the patients categorized as stable clients (or clients on less intensive models) while 34.4% are unstable patients/clients on more intensive models [20]. Stable patients are those with near-perfect ART adherence and who have achieved virological suppression while ‘unstable patients’ are those that still have ART adherence challenges and are still virally non-suppressed [19,20]. In Uganda, DSD models for stable patients include a) Fast-track drug refills (FTDR) in which HIV-positive stable patients in care for six or more months, who are TB-free, pick their drugs directly from the health facility’s dispensary or ART clinic once every three months; b) community drug distribution point (CDDP) in which healthcare providers provide ART services to stable patients in a given locality (e.g., at lower-level health centers, private pharmacy or other locations) in the community on a rotational basis, once every three months; and c) Community client-led ART delivery (CCLAD) in which stable patients (who have been on HIV treatment for six or more months) are arranged into groups of 3–6 patients, one of which goes to the facility of their ART registration to pick ARV drug refills on behalf of the other members on a rotational basis (once every three months). DSD models for unstable clients include: a) Facility-based individual management and b) Facility-based groups [19,20]. This paper focuses exclusively on DSD models for stable clients. Given that the Uganda Government has prioritized self-care as part of its strategy to reach universal health care coverage [21], this study focused on three differentiated ART service delivery models for stable patients (fast-track drug refill, community drug distribution point, and community client-led ART delivery), hereafter referred to as ‘self-care-oriented DSDM’ (SC-DSDM), due to their potential increased efficiency within the HIV care system while enabling clients to receive self-care-oriented FP services. We defined self-care-oriented FP services as FP services that WLHIV, enrolled in SC-DSDM, can access and use with minimal or no provider interaction, and for which they can receive FP supplies or services of the same duration, if needed, as their ART refills. However, while integrating FP into the DSDM in general and the three SC-DSD models in particular would improve access to FP services and methods and reduce the frequency of client visits to the health facility, by the time of this assessment, no formal evaluation had been conducted to document the status of FP integration into the self-care-oriented DSD models. This assessment aimed to explore: a) the status of FP integration into the three SC-DSDM, b) client, health provider, implementing partner and policymaker perspectives about and barriers to integrating FP integration into the SC-DSDM, c) whether or not FP-HIV integration was clearly defined (in terms of how it should be done, when, and by whom) within the existing DSDM guidelines, and d) suggestions on how to improve FP-HIV integration within the DSDM framework in Uganda.

Methods Study site This qualitative study was conducted in 17 districts in four purposely-selected geographical regions with the highest HIV prevalence in Uganda, based on the findings from the 2020–21 Uganda Population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey (hereafter referred to as ‘UPHIA 2020-21’) [22]. UPHIA 2020–21 was a nationwide survey conducted to provide estimates of HIV prevalence, viral load suppression, and other important HIV/AIDS program indicators [22]. The selected regions included: 1) Central-1 (HIV prevalence – 8.1%); 2) Mid-North (HIV prevalence – 7.6%); 3) South-western (HIV prevalence – 6.3%) and 4) Central-2 (HIV prevalence – 6.2%). Study design and population This was a qualitative study conducted among WLHIV who had ever used a FP method since joining a self-care-oriented DSDM; SC-DSDM implementers at health facility level (ART clinic in-charge, Facility In-charge, and Maternal and Child Health [MCH]/FP clinic in-charge); district health officials (District Health Officers [DHO], Assistant DHO in-charge of MCH, and/or district FP focal person); staff from implementing partner (IP) organizations that support health services in each region, and policymakers. Policymakers included national-level staffs who were involved in the design and rollout of the DSDM guidelines countrywide. Selection of health facilities and participants Selection of health facilities. In Uganda, government-owned/public health facilities are categorized as health center level-II (HC-II) which serves an estimated population of 5,000 people; health center level-III (HC-III) which serves an estimated population of 20,000 people; health center level-IV (HC-IV) which serves an estimated population of 100,000 people; district/general hospital which serves an estimated population of 500,000 people; regional hospital which serves an estimated population of 1,000,000 people; regional referral hospital which serves an estimated population of 2,000,000 people, and national referral hospital which serves an estimated population of 10,000,000 people [23]. Only health facilities at the level of HC-III or higher (or as otherwise classified by the Ministry of Health, if they are private health facilities) are accredited to offer ART in Uganda. Using data from the Ministry of Health’s District Health Information System Software-version 2 (DHIS-2), we documented the names of all the ART-accredited health facilities in each region and categorized them into high- and low-volume health facilities based on the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in HIV care as of June 2022. Health facilities with less than 500 PLHIV in care at the time were categorized as low-volume health facilities while those with 500 PLHIV or more in care were considered to be high-volume facilities. The cut-off (i.e., 500 PLHIV) for categorizing a health facility as ‘low-’ or ‘high-volume’ was determined arbitrarily, assuming that health facilities with 500 PLHIV or higher were more likely to have patients registered in the different self-care-oriented DSD models of interest. We purposively selected 18 health facilities across the four regions, including 14 government-owned/public health facilities and four private not-for-profit health facilities. Initially, all the six regional referral hospitals that exist within the four regions were selected (i.e., Mbarara and Kabale Regional Referral Hospitals in the Southwestern region; Masaka Regional Referral Hospital in Central-1 region; Mubende Regional Referral Hospital in Central-2 region, and Lira and Gulu Regional Referral Hospitals in the Mid-Northern region). These hospitals were included because they have a high patient load and were, therefore, presumed to implement several DSDM, including the self-care-oriented models for stable clients (i.e., facility- and community-based models). After selecting the regional referral hospitals, we purposely selected three lower-level health facilities within each region for a total of 12 health facilities. The 12 health facilities included three hospitals (two district/general hospitals and one private hospital), four government-owned/public HC-IVs, three HC-IIIs (two government-owned/public and one private health facility), and two special HIV clinics run by a national-level non-government organization. We included the two special HIV clinics because the organization that runs them has a long-standing experience in the implementation of community DSD models. Of the 18 health facilities, five were selected from the Mid-Northern region; five from the South-Western region, four from Central-1 region and four from the Central-2 region. Selection of participants. Eighty-three participants were interviewed for this study, including 36 WLHIV receiving HIV care who were receiving their ARV drug refills through the three SC-DSDM (also referred to as ‘clients’ elsewhere in this paper); 35 healthcare providers working at the selected 18 health facilities; four (4) district health officials; five (5) IP staff representatives, and three (3) policymakers. To participate in the study, clients had to be stable patients, enrolled into one of the three (3) self-care-oriented DSDM, and have used a FP method since joining DSDM. At each health facility, we worked with the in-charge of the ART clinic to identify eligible WLHIV, stratified by the type of SC-DSDM they were enrolled in. The identified clients were recorded on a pre-printed participant log. The ART in-charges made initial contact with the clients (via phone contact or through a provider or linkage facilitator, as appropriate) to inform them about the study and inquire about their interest in participating in the study. While the use of the ART clinic in-charges to contact WLHIV might have influenced their participation in the study in some way, women had the right to decline participation without this (i.e., declining to participate in the study) affecting their access to routine HIV care at the same health facility. Interested WLHIV were connected to the data collector via phone (or through a provider or linkage facilitator, as appropriate) to provide them with more information about the study and conduct initial screening on the phone to confirm compliance with the study eligibility criteria. To confirm eligibility, stable clients (as designated by the ART clinic) were asked about their DSD model of enrolment and if they had ever used a FP method since they joined the DSDM. Stable clients, enrolled in any of the three SC-DSDMs and who had used a FP method since they joined the DSDM, were eligible for this study. Clients who were confirmed to be eligible were invited for an interview at the health facility. We sought informed consent from all the clients prior to their participation in the study. Regarding healthcare providers, we selected either the health facility in-charge, ART in-charge, or the MCH in-charge/FP focal person. The study team contacted the participants by phone or in person at the health facility to inform them about the study and confirm their availability. For district health staff, we obtained the names and telephone contacts of the DHOs (who are the substantive heads of health programs in their districts) from the Ministry of Health and contacted them initially via the phone. If they were willing to be interviewed, we set an appointment with them either at the district headquarters or at any other venue that they considered appropriate. Through the DHOs, we obtained the names and telephone contacts of the other district health staffs (Assistant DHO in charge of MCH or District FP Focal Person) who were also contacted and an appointment was set with them if they were willing to be interviewed. We used the same strategy while approaching the implementing partner organizations in each region. Implementing partner organizations were asked to recommend staffs who were invited for interview at an appropriate time and venue. For policymakers, we set appointments for physical interviews through telephone calls to the respective policymakers. Data collection procedures and methods Data were collected during the months of September and October 2022 by a team of thirteen trained data collectors. In-depth interviews were conducted with WLHIV while key informant interviews were conducted with health facility staff, staff representatives from IP organizations, district health officials and policymakers using unstructured interview guides. Clients were asked questions such as: “Have you used family planning in the past?”, “What places have you gotten [FP] methods from in the past?”, and “Please think back to the past year, have you gotten your [FP] method at the same time that you got your ARV?” (See Supplementary File 1 in S1 File for details). On the other hand, key informant interviews were asked questions like: “Could you please describe how integration of FP into DSDM is meant to take place in the health facilities?”, and “What guidelines were followed during the process of integrating FP into DSDM?” (See Supplementary Files 2–4 in S1 File for details). The interviews with clients were conducted in the local language that they were comfortable with while key informant interviews were conducted in English. All the interviews were audio-recorded with permission from the participants. Interviews lasted between 45–90 minutes. Prior to data collection, the data collection team underwent fieldwork preparation training for three days. As part of the training, the data collection team pre-tested the data collection tools in a health facility in a non-study district to test data collection procedures, ensure clear wording of the data collection tools, and evaluate the readiness of the data collection team. Areas of weakness, identified during the pre-testing exercise, were corrected prior to fieldwork. Data analysis The audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim (in the same way they were conducted in the local language) and later translated into English for data analysis. An independent researcher, conversant with the local language as well as the English language, reviewed the transcripts along with the recordings for quality assurance. The transcripts were then used to conduct a Microsoft Excel-based, thematic matrix analysis. Data analysis followed the steps of the thematic framework approach, as suggested by Braun and Clarke [24]. Initially, AM read through twenty transcripts to get familiar with the data and generated a tentative list of initial codes. Using the tentative list of codes, AM searched for deductive themes of inquiry including forms of FP integration into the SC-DSDM, FP-HIV integration into the community-based DSD models, alignment of FP-HIV integration to the DSDM guidelines, perceptions about integrating FP into the SC-DSDM, barriers/challenges to FP-HIV integration in the SC-DSDM and suggestions for improving the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM. AM and JKBM reviewed the codes for each theme to check for “referential adequacy” by comparing the codes with the raw data to ensure that they accurately reflected the meanings intended by the participants [25]. Inadequacies in the codes were rectified through discarding those that were inconsistent with the themes or through adding new ones. AM and JKBM met to review and generate the final list of codes. Using the final list of codes, AM used Atlas.ti qualitative data analysis software (version 9.0) to check the remaining transcripts for relevant quotations that pertained to each a priori theme and copied and pasted them into the Excel matrix. JKBM, AM and RKW reviewed the matrix to identify rich “textual” quotations that were used in supporting the key findings presented in this paper. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) in reporting the findings [26]. Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Makerere University School of Public Research and Ethics Committee (protocol number SPH-2021–185) and registered by the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (HS2026ES). Permission was also sought from the relevant district officials and health facility in charges. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation and consent to an audio-recorded interview.

Results Characteristics of the study participants Table 1 shows the number and categories of participants included in this study. The distribution of WLHIV mimics the general distribution of the patients across the different DSDM, with the highest number of participants drawn from FTDR and the lowest number from CCLAD. Generally, there were few or no WLHIV enrolled in the CCLAD model across facilities. PPT PowerPoint slide

However, we did not know if and how FP integration into the DSDM was taking place. To understand if and how FP integration into the DSDM was taking place, we asked women to tell us about where they access their FP services and methods when they come for their ART refills. In response, a few of the women indicated that they received their FP methods from the same service delivery point where they obtain their ART refills while the majority indicated that they are referred to the maternal and child health [MCH] clinic/FP clinic. Thus, FP integration was deemed to take two different forms: a) integration through the one-stop center and b) integration through referral to another service delivery point. The two forms of FP-HIV integration are summarized below. a) FP-HIV integration through the one-stop center (i.e., combined service provision). All the 18 health facilities offered FP information and counselling to WLHIV in care through the three self-care-oriented DSD models (i.e., FTDR, CDDP, and CCLAD). However, only four health facilities offered FP services (including FP methods) and ART refills to WLHIV through the one-stop center. The four health facilities included one (1) government-owned/public Regional Referral Hospital, one (1) private-for-profit hospital, and two (2) non-governmental organization (NGO) special HIV clinics. At these health facilities, clients received both ART and FP services at the same place due to the presence of space to offer both services and a team of “knowledgeable” (multi-trained FP-HIV) health workers, as the following quotations illustrate: When I come here [at the CDDP] to get my ARVs, there is … a place where we get our ARVs from; that is where we go… After giving you your ARVs, then they give you the injection … at the same point because we have a room… in that very room, I leave with my packed ARVs; they have [also] given me my FP injection (CDDP client, Central-2 Region) “Being a regional referral hospital, we have most of the FP equipment … family planning methods, the knowledgeable health workers … stationed in the ART clinic to provide the family planning services to those patients” (Healthcare provider, South-Western Region) Although some health provider in-charges indicated that FP had been integrated into the SC-DSDM, there were cases where client interviews reviewed opposite information, with some clients reporting that they were instead referred to the MCH/FP clinic for FP services. However, some health provider in-charges acknowledged that they had tried to integrate FP services into the SC-DSDM but faced challenges in maintaining regular stocks of FP supplies. In such facilities, the offer of FP through the SC-DSDM had ceased to be provided. “We used to go with FP supplies (condoms, injectables and pills) to community outreaches but this stopped last year due to la6ck of supplies (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) b) FP-HIV integration through referral (intra- or inter-facility referral). Of the 18 surveyed health facilities, 13 offered FP services (including methods) through referral to the MCH/FP clinic on the same compound as the ART clinic while one (1) health facility (a faith-based health facility) referred clients interested in receiving FP methods to other health facilities. In health facilities that refer to the MCH/FP clinic, some healthcare staff reported that WLHIV are escorted to the MCH/FP clinic as part of the referral process, as illustrated below. “.... what we do, we health educate and select those who are willing to get FP services every day, for those who are willing, we get somebody to escort them to MCH, we make sure they are worked on very fast so that [they] can go back to the clinic to get their drugs.” (ART provider in-charge, Southwestern Region) However, in general, most WLHIV noted that when they were referred from the ART service delivery point to the MCH/FP clinic, they were not escorted to the MCH/FP clinic and had to join the queue with the other patients who were waiting to be served at that point. This form of non-coordinated, intra-facility referral increased the time that WLHIV who had come to pick their ARV refills but were also interested in getting FP methods spent in the health facility. FP integration into the community-based DSD models Integrating FP services into the community-based DSD models can provide a useful opportunity for leveraging the ART platform to offer FP services to WLHIV at the community level. This can help to reduce the need for WLHIV to come to the health facilities for FP services when they can receive them as part of community-based DSD models. In response to the question as to whether WLHIV, who receive their ARV drug refills through CDDP or CCLAD, receive FP services at the same time as their ARV drugs, most women indicated that they have to make a separate visit to the health facility for FP services. This finding was corroborated by some of the healthcare providers who confirmed that health outreach teams (which deliver ARV drugs to the community distribution points) usually do not carry FP methods along with the ARVs, with the exception of condoms. “Clients do not get FP supplies at the CDDP – these points act only as ART pick-up points. No FP services are provided there” (ART provider in-charge, Central-1 Region) During interviews with the healthcare providers, we found that there was very limited integration of FP into the community DSD models largely because the ART team prioritized ART to FP provision at the community outreach sites, and usually did not carry a mix of short-term FP supplies with them to those sites, except condoms. The only exception was the two NGO special clinics, which provided some FP methods through the CCLAD model. However, even then, our team was not able to document how FP services are provided to clients in the CCLAD model given that this model is organized to have only one person come for ART refills for the other members, usually once every three months. Otherwise, in the rest of the health facilities, integration of FP into the CCLAD model seemed not to be taking place: “… but in that [CCLAD] group, in case there is a client who is on injectable, we are not able to dispense to the [CCLAD] leader. We shall link that client to the nearby health facility to receive the method. But if the client in that group is able to come to the facility, then we shall be able to provide the family planning method she wants” (Health care provider, South-Western Region) Besides the limited FP integration into the community DSD models, we found that the implementation of the community DSD models had stalled in some geographical regions due to limited facilitation for community outreach activities. For instance, in the Central-2 region, only two of the four health facilities surveyed had active patients in the CCLAD model. Likewise, in the South-West region, only three of the five health facilities surveyed had active clients in the CDDP or CCLAD model. Alignment of FP integration with the DSDM Guidelines As noted earlier, one of the study objectives was to explore whether FP integration into the DSDM was well streamlined into the DSDM guidelines, and if so, whether integration of FP into the SC-DSDM was being implemented based on the DSDM guidelines. Our findings show that FP integration into the DSDM was not comprehensively discussed during the design of the guidelines or considered during the training of health providers prior to the roll-out of the DSDM guidelines. Specifically, the training of health providers on the implementation of the DSDM guidelines focused exclusively on improving efficiency in ART provision with no specific reference to FP integration: “I can ably say that in my own assessment... FP was not given that due attention [during the training]. We were focusing on the general principles of DSDM so when we reached on what services we were supposed to offer [under DSDM], I think our focus was mainly on ARVs, isoniazid prophylaxis, anti-TBs” (Implementing partner, South-Western Region) “I participated in rolling out the [DSDM], and training of health workers on the different models but am not aware there was a specific training on FP so it might not have been emphasized” (District Health Official, South-Western Region) In interviews with the policymakers who were involved in the design and rollout of the DSDM guidelines at national level, we were informed that since there were already FP services within the health facilities (either through the MCH or FP clinics); it was presumed that a different FP service delivery point at the ART clinic was not necessary. Instead, the policy-makers presumed that clients would access FP services through intra-facility referrals to the MCH/FP clinic. “I think we did not think so much about family planning at that time [of developing the guidelines]. We concentrated more on HIV, access to HIV services. We had not concentrated on integration [of family planning], the only thing we integrated early were those things which are closely related to HIV like TB” (Policymaker, National level) Perceptions about FP integration into the DSDM When we interviewed clients regarding their perspectives on integrating FP into the DSDM, all of them agreed that integrating FP into the DSDM as part of the HIV care clinic is convenient and less time-consuming, when compared to being referred to the MCH clinic. A client from a facility where integration is taking place noted: “… when you reach there at the facility, you can easily get all these [ART and FP] services at once from the same place, you receive the ARVs and […] the family planning injection [at the same time]” (FTDR client, South-Western Region) SC-DSDM clients reported that it is inconveniencing to receive FP services from the MCH clinic because they have to line-up again (and join long lines before being served) and that, at times, FP and ART services run on different days, meaning that when they get one service (e.g., ART refills) on any typical day, they would have to come back to the facility on another day to receive another service (e.g., FP). “… sometimes there are many people at family planning [unit] so I come early and I end up leaving late. I would wish that [the services were on] the same day. That’s the only challenge I have found, time. Because I come around 9am and leave around 2pm” (FTDR client, South-Western Region) Providers and implementing partners thought that FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM would reduce waiting time at the health facility and reduce unmet need among HIV clients. “For me I say [FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM] is very good. Because it reduces the time clients take within the hospital. The client will come, get all the services in one place and go, instead of referring her to the MCH, where she finds the line is too long, and she waits for 4-5 hours yet she stays far” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) Barriers/challenges to FP integration into the DSDM Barriers/challenges to FP integration into the DSDM were explored from the providers’ and implementing partners’ point of view. The most common barriers, cited by both providers and implementers, were: staff shortages, stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, shortage of office space, difficulty synchronizing FP and HIV service return-time, increased workload, and lack of integrated registers, as indicated in the following sub-sections. a) Staff shortages. Across health facilities, health provider in-charges reported that they had few health providers allocated to the HIV clinic and that given the heavy client load in the HIV clinic, most health providers focus on ART service provision at the expense of FP services. In one health facility which had a designated health worker to serve WLHIV interested in FP services when they come to the ART clinic, we were informed that the said health worker had been transferred to another health facility without any replacement plans in place. There used to be a trained midwife who offered FP in the ART clinic. However, she is on maternity leave and on transfer to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital. There is no plan for a replacement (ART health provider in-charge, Mid-Northern Region) b) Stock-outs of short-term FP commodities. Persistent stock-outs of FP supplies were reported across all health facilities to the extent that in at least one health facility, providers had resorted to encouraging clients to use long-term reversible methods that were more commonly available than short-term FP methods that were always out of stock. This has implications for the available FP methods-mix that WLHIV can choose from, depending on their preferences. At another health facility, health providers reported that short-term FP supplies run out so fast yet there is no replenishment plan in place. [We used to have] someone who would offer Sayana press to [WLHIV] in the HIV clinic but supplies ran out in only two months and there has not been any replenishment (ART health provider in-charge, Central-1 Region) “Another challenge [to integration] is that FP commodities are not there. If they would be providing us with a constant [supply of] these short-term commodities and there are no stock-outs, then our service delivery will be perfect.” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) c) Shortage of adequate office space. Health providers reported that one of the challenges they have faced regarding integrating FP into the SC-DSDM is the issue of space. Health providers reported that the limited HIV clinic space was not sufficient to enable them to provide some FP methods, especially those that would require client privacy. “FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM is okay but the challenge we have now is space, because initiating any mother or any client on family planning, we first need to examine and now at the ART clinic, space for examination of mothers it is not there” (Healthcare provider, South-western Region) “… I would say our space [is a challenge]. By the time we made that construction in ART clinic, family planning program was not there but now we have to squeeze in the limited space we are having, it is where we do the screening for cervical cancer, then again it is where we have FP, it is the same place” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) d) Difficulty in synchronizing FP and HIV return-time and duration of supplies. Another important challenge was that FP and ART do not have synchronized schedules. For this reason, while a woman may come for their ART drug refill on a particular day, it was likely that FP services were provided on another clinic day which required them to come back at another time. This lack of synchronization of FP and ART schedules made women to resort to obtaining their FP supplies elsewhere rather than return to the same health facility on another day to receive their FP supplies. In addition, while women would be given ART drug refills for six months, there was no indication that women who used contraceptive pills, for instance, were given supplies to last them until their next ART refill visit date. “… [FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM] is a good thing but the implementation is not as smooth … I just want to give an example of someone in [in the] fast-track model; right. This mother is going to…. take ARVs for six months and maybe on that day she gets her family planning shot, in those six months she will be expected to have gotten another family planning shot” (Implementing partner, Mid-Northern Region) e) Use of different registers for FP and HIV data capture. At health facility, FP and HIV services are captured in different registers. Since the FP register is usually located at the MCH/FP side of the health facility, providing FP services to women receiving their drug refills through the SC-DSDM would require that the ART provider go to the MCH/FP clinic to complete the FP register; something that most providers find burdensome and time consuming. For instance, in the health facilities where FP services were provided at the same time as the ART drug refills, some ART providers use a paper-log to capture the details about their ART client who had received FP services, and then use the paper-log to complete the FP register at another time. Given the staff shortages in the ART clinics and the burden that would come with providing FP services through the SC-DSDM, most of the health workers preferred to refer the women to the MCH/FP clinic rather than offer FP services at the same ART service delivery point. “The issue is about the documentation and even the accountability of the commodities. We are not supposed to be having 2 data tools [registers] within the facility, it is supposed to be one. So, it is better to offer it [FP] through MCH” (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) What this healthcare provider was trying to emphasize was the fact that health facilities are not expected to maintain two registers for the same service (e.g., have a FP register at the ART clinic and a different copy at the MCH/FP clinic), it is better to have the FP register at the MCH/FP clinic which traditionally provides FP and other maternal-related services in health facility settings. f) Inadequate facilitation for outreach activities. Inadequate financial facilitation and/or lack of transport to go for community outreaches were cited as one of the main challenges faced by health workers as they integrated FP into community-based DSDM. Some health providers reported that while they had started to operate the community-based models, they had to close them due to lack of funding or client instability. “Those ones [the CCLAD] we tried at the beginning when we were starting the community delivery model but it didn’t pick up … They [clients] were shifting from [one] place to the other, others went to school” (Healthcare provider, South-Western Region) “It [the CDDP arrangement] didn’t go on because of facilitation. There’s a challenge of transport. Even when these health workers go to the field, at least they need like a bottle of water, but now the finances are limited. So, it couldn’t go on” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) Suggestions on how to improve FP integration into the SC-DSDM To address the above-mentioned barriers/challenges to FP integration into the SC-DSDM, implementing partners, healthcare providers and district health managers suggested a need to: a) build the capacity of existing HIV staff in the provision of FP services; b) recruit additional health workers to deal with the persistent staff shortages; c) provide integration guidelines to the health facilities; and d) merge reporting tools. These points are elaborated below. a) Build the capacity of existing ART staff to offer FP services. To improve the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM, most health care providers suggested that HIV providers should be continuously trained in the provision of FP services. For the CCLAD model, the health providers recommended that expert clients should be trained to provide FP services to fellow clients in the community. “Mainly it could be better if all the people that are attached to the ART clinic are trained to offer all the family planning services offered to the clients. If that is done, it means that these clients will be receiving services from one point other than being referred to the MCH clinic” (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) “The other thing I have seen is that for the CCLAD their expert client requires training like what we did for the Village Health Teams (VHT) so that when he takes for them family planning methods and (he/she) is asked questions and he/she can answer. The VHT members were trained and showed how to inject for family planning therefore the expert client needs to be trained especially on how to inject for family planning because an injection must not just be given by one who is not trained” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) b) Recruit additional health workers to minimize staff shortages. In addition to building the capacity of available staff through training, some of the health care provider in-charges recommended the need to recruit more health workers to address staff shortages and reduce the workload created by the need to provide FP at the same service delivery point on top of HIV services. “Maybe they [the Ministry of Health] should […] recruit more health workers to deal with the large clientele. I know because the line is long in the [HIV] clinic because of the number of clients they receive and now the integration, so they have to make sure that they bring more health workers to give the service [integrated services]. That is what I think, because there are delays to the clients as they must wait for the available health workers to offer the different integrated services to them” (Healthcare provider, South-western Region) c) Provide clear guidelines on FP integration into the SC-DSDM to health providers. A few health workers acknowledged that there were no clear guidelines on how they should integrate FP into the SC-DSDM at the health facilities. They therefore recommended the need to provide clear guidelines to guide health workers in the provision of FP services integrated into the SC-DSDM. The availability of these guidelines should help to address some of the challenges already mentioned in this paper, including the need for synchronized FP/HIV return times and duration of FP supplies; how WLHIV receiving FP services at a different service delivery point (other than the HIV clinic or CDDP) should be handled when they come for FP services; and what data should be collected, when, and using what data capture tools when WLHIV under the SC-DSDM receive FP services: “We don’t have a clear guideline of the integration. There is no document you can look at to know how we integrate this; there is no such document, there are no standard operating procedures to refer to. We need supporting guidelines to help the health worker to routinely refer to, to make the integration better” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) d) Merge FP and HIV reporting tools. Some participants recommended the need to merge the reporting tools to reduce the burden of having to fill in two different (FP and HIV) registers where a person received FP and HIV services. “… We have an independent register for family planning; can we have the same dispensing log to capture ART commodities and family planning commodities? Because you find a health worker after writing a huge book for ART, you close the chapter; open another huge book for family planning. Let them have one register for that! Yeah. That should be changed completely because most problems are in the work you have to do when the patient has left. You find people struggling with books. So, they should look into that” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region)

Discussion This study found that all the 18 facilities sampled offered FP information/ counseling through the three self-care-oriented DSDM but only four facilities provided FP methods in the same ART clinic or in the same community outreach visit. In general, we found that: a) most of the clients receiving their ARV drug refills through the facility-based DSD models have to access FP methods through referral to the MCH/FP clinic, located outside the ART service delivery point while b) most of the clients receiving their RV drug refills through the community-based DSD models have to make a separate physical visit to the MCH/FP clinic, usually on another day, to obtain their FP supplies. The finding that only four out 18 health facilities had FP integrated into the SC-DSDM is frustrating given current efforts to support the integration of FP into non-HIV services in Uganda [27]. However, these findings are not unusual [28–30]. In an evaluation of FP integration into the DSDM in Kenya in 2020, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Foundation found that FP services were not integrated into the comprehensive HIV care clinics in Kenya but required referral to the MCH unit. No FP services were integrated into ART refill visits, either in facility or community settings; as a result, all pre-packed ARVs for distribution in facility or community models did not include contraceptive commodities. Besides, ART and FP refills and visits were not formally aligned [30]. However, the successful integration of FP into services offered at HIV care clinics in other African settings has also been documented. In Tanzania, for example, contraceptive care was provided at the HIV care and treatment clinic, but in a different room and by a different healthcare provider as for ART refills. Contraceptive refills were aligned with ART refills (i.e., 3 months oral pills for those who receive 3-month ART refills) and could be collected along with ART (although women could queue for certain methods). Two lower-level sites offered a one-stop shop approach, while in higher level hospitals, FP services were offered by a different provider in a different room than ART [30]. The Tanzania example lends credence to the fact that integrating FP into the SC-DSDM is possible (only that it is not happening as expected) and that WLHIV can ably access FP services through these models. However, what is less documented is how the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM affects FP service uptake, including whether or not FP and ART supplies have been synchronized. Future research is needed to assess the dynamics of FP uptake in a FP-HIV integrated framework to inform the scale-up of FP-HIV integration across programs and countries. Our finding that FP information and counseling were provided to all clients at the surveyed health facilities demonstrates a very important step to ensure WLHIV have the information needed to reach their reproductive goals. Previous research shows that WLHIV who receive any FP counseling are significantly more likely to report current use of modern contraception than those who do not [31,32]. These findings support the need to ensure that FP counseling provided to WLHIV is of good quality and to enhance FP counseling when quality standards are not met. We, however, did not assess the quality of the FP information and counseling provided. Future research should focus on assessing quality and new tools to facilitate efficient provision of information and counseling in the context of staff shortages and numerous clients. We found that most WLHIV accessed FP services through non-coordinated intra-facility referral to the MCH/FP clinic. This means that when WLHIV are referred from the ART clinic to the MCH/FP clinic, they have to line up afresh for FP services since there is no prior arrangement (coordination) between the two clinics to offer timely FP services to the women referred from the ART clinic. The absence of FP supplies at the ART clinic is a historical challenge that emanates from the fact that, traditionally, FP services at health facility level are provided through the MCH/FP clinic. We think that the traditional alignment of FP with MCH services makes HIV providers to feel less compelled to stock FP services as part of HIV care. While this may be speculative (since we did not specifically collect data on HIV service providers’ attitudes towards providing FP services within the ART clinic), we believe that the long-standing availability of FP services at the MCH/FP clinic may call for a need to strengthen FP-HIV integration through coordinated intra-facility referral as an alternative model of integration, especially in situations where integration through the one-stop center may not be practically possible or achievable. Our findings already point to the fact that, in practice, there is more integration going on through collaboration than the one-stop center; thus, it may be helpful for the Ministry of Health and the donor community to explore the potential benefits of strengthening FP-HIV integration through referral to the MCH/FP clinic vis-à-vis promoting integration through the one-stop center that may be less feasible in some situations. However, it is important to note that the women interviewed for this study indicated a preference for the one-stop center model of FP integration into the SC-DSDM. The acceptability of integration as one of the approaches necessary to improve health service delivery has been documented in other studies [33,34]. For instance, in a study conducted in Mayuge, Uganda, Mezei et al. [33] found that 99% of women and 100% of the surveyed community health workers felt that integrating community-based HIV testing with cervical cancer screening was acceptable. In this same study, women noted a preference for a combined service delivery model as it can save them time and eliminate additional trips to the health center, which have resource implications, in cases when services are not available on the same day. Women living with HIV face heightened vulnerability compared to their counterparts who do not live with HIV given that they have to manage a chronic condition for life. The importance of facilitating access to holistic health care that addresses their full needs has been highlighted as the HIV community moves towards more holistic care [35] and lends credence to the fact that offering FP methods and ART refills in the same place, at the same time, by the same or a different provider is not only acceptable but also possible. However, the one-stop shop model, usually dubbed as “combined service provision” in the case of integrating FP into immunization services [36], is likely harder to achieve than models that offer information/counseling plus referral given that it requires staff training and coordination such as the need to synchronize or integrate family planning and HIV commodity supply chains [37]. Studies also show that the implementation of the one-stop shop model can be hampered by patients’ fear of stigma and discrimination (especially in community-based ART models), patients’ and providers’ low literacy levels on the DSD model and supply chain inconsistencies [29,38]. Thus, efforts geared at strengthening the provision of FP services through coordinated intra-facility referral may be the game-changer needed to improve access to FP services in most resource-constrained settings including Uganda. While the Ministry of Health has already developed a National Strategy for Integration of Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH), HIV/AIDS, TB, Nutrition and Gender Based Violence (GBV) [39], we believe that the need for the development of implementation guidelines to support the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM remains essential. It is important to note that the above-mentioned SRH-HIV-GBV strategy examines the aspect of integration from the point of view of sexual and reproductive health rather than from the HIV care point of view, offering limited guidance on how and when to integrate FP into the SC-DSDM. To support the integration of FP into the DSDM in general and SC-DSDM in particular, it will be essential that the Ministry of Health develops specific DSDM-focused, FP-HIV integration implementation guidelines that define how, when and for whom the integration should happen in each health facility. The Ministry of Health should put in place mechanisms to ensure a constant supply of contraceptive supplies as well as provide for adequate office space to improve space available for the implementation of the one-stop center integration approach. Combined reporting tools that capture data on the use of both FP and ARV drug refills may need to be developed to avoid the need for completing two different registers; one for the HIV care and the other for the FP supplies received. Finally, since we did not assess contraceptive uptake among WLHIV enrolled in the different SC-DSDM, we recommend further studies to assess differentials in FP uptake across the different SC-DSDM and document barriers/challenges and facilitators of contraceptive uptake under each DSD model within the FP-SC-DSDM integrated framework.

Study limitations and strengths This study was limited by the purposive sampling approach. Strictly interpreted, the results are only applicable to WLHIV who were interviewed for this study and not to the general population of WLHIV in the study regions in particular or Uganda in general. Nonetheless, the four study regions were chosen to represent a variety of local characteristics and we feel that the results will be useful to policymakers in designing guidelines for integrating FP into the SC-DSDM in other similar contexts. The other limitation is that this study relied on the self-reports of the clients and health providers regarding FP-HIV integration and the health facilities were categorized as integrating or not integrating based on this information. Because most WLHIV indicated that they obtained their FP services from the MCH/FP clinic, we categorized most health facilities as not integrating FP into the SC-DSDM without verifying that they actually obtained their FP methods from the MCH/FP clinics. If we did, this should have helped to inform our decision regarding whether or not the health facilities were actually integrating or not integrating FP into the SC-DSDM. However, we believe that this is a minor limitation. Given that we triangulated data collection methods and data sources (i.e., data were collected using in-depth interviews and key informant interviews with a diversity of participants including WLHIV, program implementers, district health managers, and policymakers), we believe that we made an accurate estimate of the FP-HIV integration status at the health facilities that we visited. Lastly, while we documented challenges/barriers inherent in implementing FP integration in the SC-DSDM, we relied on self-reports but did not try to quantify the magnitude of each barrier/challenge. For instance, we did not collect data on stock-outs of FP supplies but relied on self-reports during the provider interviews. This was because this study was conducted as a landscaping, qualitative study to inform future FP integration into the SC-DSDM rather than as a survey to obtain quantitative measures of each of the challenges/barriers noted. These limitations notwithstanding, our study had a number of strengths. First and foremost, this study is one among the few studies that have assessed FP-HIV integration from the perspective of SC-DSDM. Thus, while studies on integration of HIV with other services, including family planning, have been previously conducted, these studies did not assess FP integration from the perspective of SC-DSDM. We, therefore, believe that the study findings can help to inform the design of FP-HIV integration interventions in the context of SC-DSDM, including facility and community-based models. Secondly, our study involved a total of 83 qualitative interviews (including in-depth interviews and key informant interviews) with different categories of participants, including clients, healthcare providers, district health managers, implementing partner representatives, and policy-makers, thereby improving the credibility of the findings through triangulation by data source and data collection methods.

Conclusion Our findings show that despite the potential benefits of integrating FP into the SC-DSDM, only four out of 18 health facilities offered FP services integrated into the SC-DSDM. Even in the few facilities that integrated FP into SC-DSDM, several challenges/barriers, including frequent stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, staff shortages, and lack of adequate office space continued to hamper effective integration. Unfortunately, while the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM is being spear-headed by the donor community, at the moment, there are no guidelines to inform the effective integration of FP into the SC-DSDM. These findings call for policy guidance from the Ministry of Health in integrating FP into the SC-DSDM in Uganda. This will not only help in ensuring that there is uniform implementation of FP integration into the SC-DSDM but also provide guidance on how to address the barriers that currently inhibit the effective integration of FP into SC-DSDM in Uganda.

NbS for addressing water security challenges in cities are widely recognized for accelerating sustainability and delivering multiple co-benefits. However, peer-reviewed studies and implementation guidance have primarily focused on the Global North, necessitating adaptation for the Global South. While NbS could provide environmental and socio-economic benefits, the specific adaptations required for planning, designing, and implementing in the context of the Global South remain unclear. During the 6th Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE 6) held in Brisbane, Australia, in May 2023, a group of interdisciplinary experts discussed these challenges. This was followed by in-depth discussions with additional experts spanning various sectors across the Global South and a comprehensive literature review. This paper presents the outcomes of these efforts specifically focused on three objectives: understanding the NbS planning context in the Global South, identifying unique challenges for implementing NbS in these regions, and identifying “bright spots” as learning opportunities for implementation. We outline the contextual differences between the Global North and Global South in the context of water security and NbS, and then the challenges and opportunities to mainstream urban water NbS in the Global South are discussed across four thematic categories: environmental; socio-economic and perceptional; capacity, knowledge and expertise; and management and governance. We highlight select bright spots to foster a broader understanding of ongoing efforts in the Global South. Ultimately, we seek to highlight opportunities for more efficient and socially-just pathways for adoption of NbS to address urban water security in the Global South. We also recommend practical steps such as capacity building in NbS design and implementation, development of best practices and support tools, monitoring of outcomes, consideration of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM) as NbS and building partnerships for all of these with stakeholders.

1. Introduction Many urban water management activities are, at their core, centered on providing communities with safe access to water and sanitation, reducing hazard risks, and balancing infrastructure performance with ecological and social outcomes. Said differently, urban water management seeks to increase water security for city residents. While no universal definition exists [1] water security can be broadly defined as “an acceptable level of water-related risks to humans and ecosystems, coupled with the availability of water of sufficient quantity and quality to support livelihoods, national security, human health, and ecosystem services” [2–4]. In cities, water security involves the set of systems for managing waterways, moving potable and sanitary flows, recycling water, and coping with (and facilitating) natural variability [5,6]. Urban water managers apply multiple actions in pursuit of this goal, including conventional infrastructure, policy mechanisms, and nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are well-recognized as a potential strategy to achieve sustainability goals and deliver multiple co-benefits from water infrastructure and other systems with potential applications globally. NbS “leverage nature and the power of healthy ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and safeguard a stable and biodiverse future” [7]. While experts typically think about NbS from their particular disciplinary perspective [8], this and other definitions of NbS involve the integration of multiple fields in the natural and social sciences. In this review, NbS are understood as interventions inspired by nature that address societal challenges, provide multiple ecosystem services and ecological benefits, and perform infrastructure services related to water security. NbS represent a promising suite of methods for simultaneously addressing multiple societal challenges and bridging the historic divide between infrastructure planning and biodiversity conservation [9,10]. Nowhere is the promise of NbS more relevant than in regions of the so-called “Global South”. Urban areas of the Global South face water security challenges due to rapid urbanization, population growth, climate change impacts, and often inadequate infrastructure [11–13]. However, much of the current NbS literature focuses on the context of wealthier countries in developed regions and temperate climates (e.g., [14,15]), with limited research on NbS in the Global South (see for example: [16–19]. One reason for this perceived lack of NbS adoption is the use of different lexicons depending on the region and context. Some alternative terms common in the Global South include green infrastructure [20], ecological solutions, natural resource management, landscape-based solutions [21], urban greenspaces, stormwater best management practices, biological engineering, ecosystem-based adaptation, and social technology [22]. In this paper, we use the term NbS to collectively capture these actions that meet the spirit and goals of NbS but are referred to by different terms. Here, we examine the unique challenges of applying NbS to address urban water security in the Global South. Our objectives are to 1) understand the different contexts for NbS implementation between the Global South and North, 2) identify unique challenges for implementing NbS for urban water security, and 3) describe opportunities for NbS implementation by learning from“bright spots” (i.e., examples of especially successful implementation, [23] in the Global South). We acknowledge that binary terms like Global North vs. Global South, developed vs. developing, or high- vs. low-income present a false dichotomy for several reasons. For example, the magnitude and rate-of-change of development are not uniform within regions, simple economic metrics do not differentiate nuanced global differences, local context is crucial, and exceptions exist to any dichotomy [24]. However, we use these terms to draw contrasts between the context of NbS implementation for urban water security with the goal of identifying potential challenges in transfer of planning and design recommendations across these regions.

2. Approach A multi-pronged approach, based on an in-person workshop, virtual discussions, and literature review, was used to understand how NbS could address urban water security challenges in the Global South. The in-person workshop was conducted in two sessions at the Sixth Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE 6), held in Brisbane, Australia, in May 2023. A workshop proposal with the background and purpose of the workshop was used to announce andcommunicate the sessions and 12 experts registered for and participated in them. The workshop proposal is provided in supplementary documents (S1 Text). Following the in-person discussions, we conducted virtual discussions with 20 experts working across the Global South to expand the topical and geographic breadth of perspectives. Participants were selected based on expertise and regional location to encompass a range of countries within the Global South and were identified via professional networking and recommendations. They were then invited via email for a discussion session. A consistent set of topics were covered with all participants using a discussion guide. A list of discussion guide questions is provided in the supplementary document (S2 Text). Participants shared their experiences working in a diverse cross-section of countries, including the Bahamas, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and other locales. The participants also drew from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, including environmental economics and policy, landscape architecture, life sciences, anthropology, social sciences, and engineering. In addition, we conducted a literature review to supplement discussion findings. During the in-person workshop, initial insights were collected from the participants after a brief introductory presentation. Experts reflected on current practices and identified challenges and opportunities to implement NbS based on experiences in home countries, including Australia, Ethiopia, India, New Zealand, Niger, the Philippines, and the United States of America. Participants discussed key topics in smaller breakout sessions and reconvened with the large group to reflect. An interactive online discussion platform (Miro) was used to collect input and notes during the workshop and to facilitate the discussion. Participant inputs were then summarized into the themes of challenges and opportunities. The virtual discussions were conducted in two phases. First, discussions were conducted in small groups (one-to-one or a maximum of two participants). Then, a more extensive group discussion was conducted with the experts who wanted to become involved in the development of this manuscript. Audio recordings and manual note-taking were used to collect data during these discussions. Informed consent was given by all participants before data collection. The findings from the SUSE 6 conference workshop and the data collected from experts’ interviews were synthesized and cross checked. The findings from virtual discussions were summarized by the Author team using the interactive online platform (Miro) and combined with workshop input. The findings from the workshops and virtual discussion were analyzed thematically, resulting in four categories: environmental; socio-economic and perceptional; capacity, knowledge and expertise; and management and governance. In addition to the qualitative, lived experience and professional expertise represented in these dialogs, we conducted a review based on targeted literature search of NbS practices to cross-validate and support the discussion findings. The review included peer-reviewed journal articles and “gray literature” (conference proceedings, reports, etc.) on urban water security and NbS practices from both the Global South and North to understand contrasting practices and opportunities for knowledge sharing. We organized our search around urban water security NbS and specific search terms used in Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science™ are provided in the supplementary file (S3 Text). The resulting set of literature was analyzed to cross-validate discussion themes and findings and identify additional challenges and opportunities. Combined discussion and literature review findings were checked again by sending the final draft of the paper to workshop participants for their review and input. We collated “bright spots” as unique opportunities to further learn from regional practices and support the findings. All efforts were made to support regional and disciplinary representation for the in-person workshop and virtual discussions. However, gaps inevitably remain. Further, since most of the participants are from academia, the authors acknowledge the lack of certain voices, such as practitioners, government representatives, and city planners.

4. Summary This article is a response to a scholarly body of literature that focuses on NbS in the Global North and the implicit assumptions that this knowledge is equally applicable to other regions of the globe. The highlighted bright spots direct attention to the considerable NbS work currently undertaken in the Global South. The challenge, therefore, is two-fold: to develop a broader scholarly appreciation for ongoing work in the Global South and to incorporate this knowledge into a generalized understanding of the roles, pathways, and possibilities of NbS across theglobe. Although some obstacles are particularly salient in the Global South, many of these also exist within the Global North, even if to a lesser or different degree. Learning that draws from multiple contexts contributes to more robust understanding and can lead to greater creativity in the planning, design, and implementation of NbS. NbS systems can potentially provide Global South regions a pathway to enhance urban water security and achieve SDGs. However, the integration of NbS with conventional infrastructure systems is a prerequisite for effectiveness and viability, and this requires collaboration across disciplines from ecology to civil engineering and across institutions from researchers to practitioners. Leveraging local and Indigenous knowledge and involving local communities in the planning and implementation process is crucial for the success of NbS.in addition to increasing the likelihood of socially just and publicly supported projects. NbS planning in the Global South countries could approach problems from a climate-change adaptation and co-benefits perspective that considers biodiversity conservation, social vulnerability reduction, environmental justice, and Indigenous customs and knowledge preservation. A close scrutiny of the evolving political economy, political, and spatial ecology dimensions of NbS in the context of urbanization and urban development priorities would be useful. Since NbS practices have a relatively smaller track record in the Global South, incorporating NbS conceptual frameworks and best practices across education levels may increase the incorporation of these practices in future development and implementation. Including NbS in urban planning policy and planning NbS in portfolios rather than single projects in isolation would be a great approach. Also, understanding the benefits of NbS for urban resilience would help planners and decision makers maximize the implementation of NbS in their cities. Also, financial allocation support and funding for climate adaptation based on ecosystems (i.e., NbS) is needed to overcome financial barriers. This paper outlines the challenges and opportunities for implementing NbS in the Global South. Building on the findings outlined above, it is crucial to consider actionable steps to address the identified challenges. The following recommendations are proposed. Practical recommendations A regional best practices manual and a dynamic portal for NbS for water security could be developed that includes biophysical, ecological, hydrological and environmental justice dimensions to guide donors, corporates, government agencies and civil society organizations.

New curricula on NbS in teaching and training of city engineers, urban planners, and landscape architects would be required for scaling up adoption of NbS in city planning and development.

Mapping of potential NbS sites in cities based on integration of blue, green, and grey infrastructure and potential beneficiaries would help decision makers and developers make informed decisions

Investment in independent monitoring of environmental and social variables as part of project design and implementation to assess performance of NbS and learn reasons for success and failure would enable improvement and accountability.

Partnerships among governments, NGOs, academia, private sectors, local communities, and financial sectors to jointly develop and implement NbS projects may result in fewer trade-offs and enhance synergies amongst stakeholders.

Other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM) where conservation of biodiversity is achieved as a co-benefit of land-use outside protected areas offers opportunities for linking water security for cities to national and global ecosystem and biodiversity conservation targets.

UNITED NATIONS, May 29 2025 (IPS) - The humanitarian situation in Haiti has deteriorated significantly in the recent weeks as rates of violence, hunger, and displacement soar amid a severe lack of funding. As armed gangs continue to seize more territory in the capital, Port-Au-Prince, as well as in areas in the Artibonite and Centre Department, humanitarian organizations have found themselves unable to keep up with the growing scale of needs.



Haiti is considered to be one of the poorest countries within the western hemisphere and relies heavily on foreign aid to fund the majority of basic services for its citizens. According to figures from ACAPS, a nonprofit organization that provides daily analysis on current humanitarian crises, the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) for Haiti had called for USD 673.8 million, 65 percent of which was contributed by the United States. Due to the Trump administration’s reduction in USAID for over 90 programs, the amount of funding Haiti receives this year could look very different.

Heightened insecurity and worsened living conditions in Haiti have resulted in a 34 percent increase in needs as this year’s HNRP calls for USD 908 million. In the first two months of 2025, the U.S. provided nearly half of all foreign aid that was committed to Haiti, totaling at nearly USD 23.1 million. ACAPS estimates project that the total HNRP will be severely underfunded this year, with the food, healthcare and protection sectors being among the most affected.

Additionally, the reduction in funding from the U.S. could have significant implications for the efficacy of the United Nations (UN) in crisis-affected nations like Haiti. Not only will the delivery of humanitarian aid be constricted, but a variety of programs that monitor impending disasters, such as climate shocks, economic downturns, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, could be terminated.

“The pullback of U.S. funding will limit the United States’ ability to shape the UN system, to maintain its leadership of UN agencies, and to put the UN tools, especially in peacemaking situations, to use. More broadly, these funding cuts will have negative repercussions for the perception of the United States around the globe,” said Allison Lombardo, a senior associate with Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Estimates from the UN indicate that armed groups in Haiti have taken control of over 90 percent of Port-Au-Prince, spurring concern from humanitarian groups that the gangs could completely override efforts from law enforcement and the state. “It’s an unsustainable catastrophe. We could lose Port-au-Prince at any time,” said Claude Joseph, the former prime minister of Haiti.

The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) states that over 1,600 civilians were killed as a direct result of gang violence in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Additionally, according to figures from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), over 60,000 people have been internally displaced since February.

William O’Neill, the UN’s independent expert on the human rights situation in Haiti, states that the rampant insecurity in the capital can be attributed to a consistent influx of firearms from the US to Haiti. According to Amnesty International, over 600,000 guns are currently in circulation, with more coming in every day.

“The gangs have access to an increasing number of high calibre weapons, and a seemingly endless supply of ammunition and some gangs have weapons that pierce armour. This is very dangerous because the Haitian National police and the multinational security support mission led by Kenya are really relying on their armoured vehicles to provide them protection,” said O’Neill.

According to figures from the World Food Programme (WFP), over 5.7 million people, or roughly half of Haiti’s population, faces acute food insecurity. 227,000 children from the ages of six months to five years, as well as numerous pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, are at risk of acute malnutrition, with over 125,000 severe cases having been recorded already.

Haiti has also experienced another surge in sexual violence in the past month. On May 3, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the death of a six year-old girl after experiencing a rape in a displacement site in Port-Au-Prince. According to the UN, over 333 women and girls were subjected to gender-based and sexual violence in the first quarter of 2025, with 96 percent of these cases being rape. These victims have struggled to recover due to a lack of judicial and psychosocial support.

Additionally, the lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services has led to a rise in cholera cases. The UN Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, Stéphane Dujarric has said that as of May 28, there have been over 2,100 cases of cholera reported, with 28 associated deaths. Dujarric added that rates of infection are highest in densely populated areas and displacement sites.

“After the families informed us of these cases, the threat remains because no decontamination session has taken place in the camp. We lack the materials to carry out the cleaning. Where we live, we are exposed to all kinds of diseases,” said Jhonny Élysée, president of the Bois-Verna camp committee.

Due to aid deliveries being hampered by threats of gang violence, basic services have been stretched to their limits for the majority of civilians in Haiti. According to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), over 60 percent of healthcare facilities in Port-Au-Prince are nonfunctional or operate with significant shortages in personnel, funding, and medical supplies.

“The number of seriously injured patients has risen steadily over the past four weeks. Nearly 40 percent of them are women and children,” said Dr. Seybou Diarra, coordinator of MSF’s Tabarre Hospital.

“We are now creating hospital rooms in the meeting rooms. The medical teams are exhausted, and the intensification of violence around the structure complicates the conduct of our activities, as we are located next to areas that are regularly under attack, with a high risk of stray bullets…If the situation doesn’t calm down, I fear that many of the wounded will die for lack of available treatment.”
