People might say the wazungu just go to and showcase the bad areas but fail to question why we have those dilapidated areas. Accountability from our leaders in these areas is so lacking while ukienda huko unaoneshwa mansions za governors, mps, and former chancellors or whatever they were before the new constitution.  A youtuber does more for a community than what the administration does with funding, taxes, and loans. Make it make sense. Anyway, i appreciate all the efforts beast philanthropy, JerryRigEverything, among others are doing.

Kenya,foreign aid,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,foreign aid,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,4,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/
Kenya,foreign aid,Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",1743469962.0,2025-04-01 01:12:42,120,124,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Kenya,foreign funding,Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2.

To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Kenya,foreign funding,Be very cautious of the UAE,"Kasongo has been cozying up to the UAE recently and as Kenyans we should be very careful here, if you look at their foreign policy they a pattern of fostering chaos and undermining democracy and legitimate governments.

- In Sudan they fund and support the RSF ,in fact there are reports that they are the ones who pushed the RSF into launching the war.
- In Somalia they support the breakaway region of Somaliland.
- In Libya they fund and support the warlord, Khalifa Haftar.
- In Egypt they orchestrated a coup to overthrow Morsy, the only democratically elected leader in Egypt.

I don't know but who's to say that they will not try and help Kasongo in subverting the 2027 elections? After all they wouldn't wanna lose their logistics hub.

Kenya,foreign funding,"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”  

Edit:To the trolls: Save your Bible verses. This is about Kenyan lives.

Kenya,foreign funding,"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

•	When (and where) do you expect to retire?

Also, given our income levels, extended family responsibilities, and economic challenges, do you think FIRE is realistic in the Kenyan context?

Kenya,foreign funding,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,foreign funding,"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

* Rift Valley delivered 78% of votes to Ruto in 2022. This base isn't eroding.
* Mt. Kenya may complain but historically votes for the incumbent (see Kibaki's 2007 re-election despite discontent).

**5. Our Neighbors Are Progressing While We Obsess Over Politics**

* Tanzania attracted **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank), while Uganda's **oil project** is projected to generate **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank). Furthermore, Uganda's **oil project** is expected to generate **2 billion** annually, starting in **2025** (Uganda Ministry of Energy).

Meanwhile, Kenya attracted just **$1.2 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the same period (CBK 2023 Report).

As of now, we're already in **2027 campaign mode.**

* Gen Z isn't getting IDs (only 1.2M new registrations in 2023 vs 6M eligible)
* Middle-class Kenyans will tweet but won't vote (42% turnout in urban areas)
* The poor will vote - and they'll vote for whoever meets their immediate needs

Like it or not, #TanoTena is coming. The numbers don't lie.

Kenya,foreign funding,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,4,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/
Kenya,donor,Dear Gentle Readers,"Good morning my gentle readers

Today I have a question to this men, why are you so tied up with your friends that you prioritise them over your families ama it's just baba without manners? 

Anyway Reason number 4 on why I will never forgive baba without manners: his unhealthy attachment with his boys. 

This particular friends have been a thorn in my life and I just blame baba without manners (I will save his number like this😂😂). 
Anyway let me take you back to the end of my second trimester heading to the third, that's when we moved in together.  

How do you people house hunt when searching for a house that utaishi na spouse wako? Si mnaenda pamoja ama? And weigh the options right? 

Aaah, baba with funds went with his friends looking for a house that we are supposed to live in. I tell him, na si uende na mimi juu unaenda kuishi na mimi😐😐. It fell on deaf ears. Anyway, he goes with them looking through different houses and the only thing I get is videos and reasons why he doesn't wanna live in the area. 

He finds the house we are currently living in, and kwanza it is on the 5th floor and this building has no lift. By then I was very heavily pregnant and such a distance would have been a great inconvenience. Anyway, baba without manners commits all of that and just sends the video. I see it's a nice house and tells me, ameshalipia. 

By then, I had moved out of my sweet house🤣🤣the house i was very happy in and experienced so much growth. Aaah, baba without manners wewe🙄🙄🙄. So, he moves everything in and comes for my clothes. And tells me, he will come pick me up kesho yake. True to his word, he did come lakini hio heaviness kwa roho yangu jamani. And shockingly, nilipanda stairs mpaka fifth floor and I was out of my breath. 

But moving into that house became a thorn into my life, each weekend baba without manners forces me to go home because he wants to host his friends. At first I get mad, and walk out naenda home. One weekend I refused to go home, I told him, kwani nyi wanaume wote wasita hamuezi kakomboa air bnb mkae huko🙄🙄

Gentle readers, ni kama niliguza nyuki, he started ranting, he said venye, I do Everything for you, na we kunipea tu privacy kwa nyumba yangu ata huezi. Enda kwenu nitakukujia tuende kanisa on sunday🫥. Mimi nikasema siendi, Aaah, aliongea matope wadau hata skuamini. He left, akaenda shugli zake and came back the following day mchana claiming ametoka ulevi hata sikuuliza. 

I asked him one day, si hata unipeleke just kwa park nikaone wanyama basi. ( nikiwa mdogo sijai enda hizo school trips because apparently my shosho didn't see the need to pay for me to go see wild animals). He told me he will ask his friends they plan for it. Aaah, curse those men, walikataa wakasema huko wameenda mara mingi. Anyway, the only place baba with manners takes mi ni kanisa na kwao na kwetu sometimes. Smh. 

Nothing can be done juu lazima hio committee iamue mambo ya kwangu. Anyway, one of his friends has a wife that decided she wants to be happy. Now, they all call her a hoe just because hangojei bwana yake to do things with her. Baba without manners is now projecting that on me. He says venye akiwai nipata nikikunywa tutakosana vibaya sana. 😂😂😂. 

Now, that is really affecting my freedom, juu, lets say I go even to town, aaah baba without manners will keep calling me after every 20 minutes aniambie niende home. Kwanza saa hii with our baby is worse. He will tell me, rudi home uangalie mtoto as if I do not know that. 

Let's go to today's incident. Nimemwambia I will leave for an hour or two, my mum is coming to town na anahitaji my help. Eeei gentle readers, ashaanza kuniuliza for how long nakaa huko. I told him mimi sijui, si he left akaenda. Now as we speak, alishapiga simu kuniambia venye whatever i am going to do in town sio important at all. I should be very fast and go back home juu hio sio emergency. 

For  context, my mum kuna siku amehitaji blood donors and baba without manners did not he gave a flimsy excuse. I couldn't donate because I am breastfeeding and pia I gave birth through CS so singekubalishwa. My mum alikua admitted close to 3 weeks and hakuai bother kuenda hata kumuona and she asked for him. He said atamuonea nyumbani, two months later he has never even asked kama ako sawa. 
Aaah, baba without manners ananichukia mimi na familia yangu yote🤣🤣🤣. 
Kwanza now that i am dependent on him, he is enjoying every bit of my misery. Hata akinituma supper, of which money is calculated so he will inspect kama nimenunua what he says, he will keep calling me to make sure I am back kwa nyumba by 6pm. Claiming hataki giza inipate nje, but surely, ulinipata nikiishi pekee yangu😅😅😅 hio supper ata saa tatu ya usiku nlikua naendea. 

So men, what the hell do you rely on yiur mbogis for? 

Till later gentle readers, 
Have a fantastic day as you grind. ",1748587011.0,2025-05-30 06:36:51,60,74,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/

Kenya,development aid,Racism - how often do you as a Kenyan feel racially attacked?,"I have lived half of my life in Kenya. I've just returned to Kenya and after living abroad in developed countries, my perspective is pretty different now.

I grew up with an Indian ethnic background so it felt normal at the time but now, I have realized that most indians in Kenya are pretty racist towards black Kenyans. They don't pay well, they don't treat them like humans at work places, and worst of all, there's no trust amongst anyone.

I understand that Kenya is ridden with poverty and there's a huge disparity in income and wealth. The amount of corruption in the government prevents them from setting up financial aids for people with disabilities, for people who have lost a job, for health issues, whatever it may be, it's lacking.
This further increases the struggle in this country so I find that everyone is grinding and always seeking ways to make money even if it's ""chai"" 50-100kshs.

However, I find that the racism goes both ways and I can't exactly place the blame on any single race or single person. It's been happening for generations and it's just a norm unfortunately.

Indians who have money or are employers always make the decisions to pay less (not even minimum wage), they don't give work safety equipment or maintain facilities to a standard.

On the other hand, black Kenyans only look at indians as a way to make money and nothing more.

I went out for a walk this week and got approached like 20 times at the very least where people stare at me or my clothes or whatever it may be, they approach and beg for money or try force me to buy things even if I've said I'm not looking to buy.

If people were to call the police on racism or unfair treatment, all that happens is the police will ask for a bribe and it'll get swept under the rug, likely the black Kenyan will get fired anyway and be at a loss with no justice.

If we want Kenya to progress as a country, this shit needs to stop. Police gotta be more righteous and stop with the bribery and actually enforce rules. I notice most police don't do any actual work, they go around looking for ways to extort people for money. It could be a simple traffic thing like at the roundabouts near town, there's no need for this. Use these resources more wisely.

I remember back in 2014 I was trying to get my ID but I lost the original. I had to go get an obstruct from the police station and they said to me ""why do you think you can just get us to give you an obstruct if you can't pay us"" and I'm thinking nahhh you're a public servant, not a paid service.. and then when I go back to the ID office, the same guy who asked me to get an obstruct tells me why did you bother doing all this when you could've just paid me some money and I'd have fastracked the process for u without needing an obstruct.

It's literally in every situation. I wanna know what you guys think and if I'm being ridiculous or if there really needs to be a change. Btw I haven't even scratched the surface of what other shit goes on in this country on a daily basis. So much theft and corruption on top of the racism. 

Edit- I apologize for using ""black Kenyans"" when referring to native Kenyans. I don't mean to offend anyone but I'm glad people called me out on this, this discussion/post is for all of us to learn and treat each other better; to increase awareness and get our thoughts provoked into understanding what we need to change about ourselves, eventually (ideally rather), we can slowly start making a difference in how we approach other humans",1747643578.0,2025-05-19 08:32:58,39,116,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kq6n2s/racism_how_often_do_you_as_a_kenyan_feel_racially/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kq6n2s/racism_how_often_do_you_as_a_kenyan_feel_racially/
Kenya,development aid,Remember Vision 2030?,"Man, nilikuwa like 10 years old when that thing was being peddled. The people on TV were speaking like we were going to have flying cars and end all hunger and suffering by the time we reach 2030. Now with only five years remaining, I'm not really sure if we can reach there. I think after Kibaki, this country has only been on a downward spiral since then. And with Ruto, we've jumped from the frying pan to the fire.

Kenya,development aid,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,budget cuts,Some bad news for you,"I went to visit my parents and  with people my parents age, they like their news.

Now for one, Mimi I don't intentionally keep up with news. I get it from Tiktok and X. 

It's been a couple of hours of back to back news and here are things I didn't know.

1. There hasn't been a budget for vaccines for newborns. What??? What the actual fuck!? Thinking about how BCG needs to be administered like within the earlier weeks of life, what do you actually mean hakuna vaccines? And the ones who can't afford private hospitals, how will those babies live?

2. There is no budget for national exams. That one I knew but kitu sikujua, these morons (apologies, or not,  if you're part of the team) are launching a new system KEMIS to consolidate all education systems and learners and professionals, idk man do the research. And guess what, the system exists ni vile inaitwa NEMIS. Sounds familiar, huh? (SHIF/NHIF)

3. I won't even touch on the Sugar Mills, the budget cuts for  the education and health sectors, the state house budgets, the new MP salary increase. Yho nishukisheni.

4. There was an idiot on Citizen news this morning defending the presidency saying 200k jobs have been created. Where? And going abroad for work isn't it. Must I go to another country to get greener pastures? Why can't we empower our own people to build here? 

Liiiiiikeee all I see is damage that will take years to undo.

Eg Jana I was on the expressway and thinking, this structure will start earning Kenyans money in the 2050s, wtf!! 

This is definitely betrayal in the city juu kama we're living in Mstahiki Meya.

Anyways, may the force be with you all. Happy Friday ☺️

Kenya,budget cuts,Did people get comfortable with the way the country is being run?

Mkumbuke this government reduced budget ya healthcare by 7 billion, education by 30 billion, roads by 14 billion, and irrigation by 3.7 billion. I could go on and on about the essential services budgets that have been cut in the last 6 months. 

Meanwhile, MP salaries were increased, and the budget to renovate state house was increased. There was outrage over the conspicuous consumption by most political leaders last year before the J25 protests. Sai karibu MPs wote, governors and senators have choppers and top range vehicles. Ministers are balling at the expense of the taxpayers. Everything since J25 got worse and the rage has continued to reduce and when I say J25 was not organic you people insult me. There has been no tangible action by Kenyans since then. The conversation on the reconstitution of IEBC was never had. What happened to collecting signatures to recall MPs? Where is that rage now?

Kenya,Feed the Future,2027 Will Not Save You,"Think 2027 Will Be Fair? Think Again.

If you think the 2027 elections will run smoothly, cleanly, and according to the expected democratic script,you're in for a shock.

Picture this, you've hired a gardener to care for your beautiful garden. But instead of watering the plants, he dumps poison on the soil. Instead of pulling weeds, he uproots the healthiest flowers, clips blooming flowers, steps on the seedlings, cuts down the fruit trees, and scatters garbage across the garden. When pests show up, he invite more. When the grass starts to die, he paints it green and calls it healthy.

And when you confront him, he calmly says, ""Just be patient, it's all part of the plan"" or ""Trust the seasons, the soil will heal"".

Meanwhile, the roses wither, the plants dry out, and the once-thriving garden turns into a barren wasteland. Would you keep waiting, hoping for a miracle? Or would you replace the gardener before everything is beyond repair? Would you wait for their contract to end, or would you stop him before your garden turns to ruin? Would you let him ""finish the job""?

By 2027, the damage this country will have endured could be beyond anything we can currently imagine. Kenyans must learn to think critically, connect the dots, and read between the lines. The writing is already on the wall for those willing to see it.

Behind the scenes, dark plans are already in motion. While the country is preparing for free and fair elections, Ruto is engineering chaos. He is planning disorder because confusion is his cover, and crisis is his currency. While the public is planning for 2027, backroom deals are being made, systems are being tampered with, and loyal cronies are being quietly (and openly too, because they believe Kenyans are stupid. HA?!) installed in key positions.

MSM and commercial activists will air and flood us with fake doctored narratives as usual. Violence will be sparked in just the right places, at just the right time. Not by accident, but by design. Voter registers will mysteriously go missing. Ballots will vanish. Others will magically multiply. Legal institutions, meant to guard the process, will be either too compromised or too intimidated to act.

And when the dust settles, they'll look shocked, act confused, and call for unity after orchestrating the very divisions they now pretend to denounce. The cool-kidd here is tribalism or ""mirengo ya kisiasa"".

This isn't just about winning votes. It's about controlling the outcome no matter the cost. So no, the 2027 elections won't just be an event. They're shaping up to be a carefully staged spectacle of deception, distraction, and destruction.

So this psychopathic president has to go now, ASAP. HE MUST GO. His time is up. He has failed Kenyans. We must replace all current career politicians who have clung to power for decades, feeding off a broken system while the country suffers. We must break the cycle if we truly want a different future. This is a generational call to action. Gen-Z, Gen-Y and the awake among Gen-X, because this is our moment. Boomers should sit this one out. We already know how most of them will think, don't we?

EDIT:  
**I'm not condemning voting**. I believe in the power and responsibility of the vote. Unfortunately, ""*thinking*"" is probably a taboo for majority of Kenyan voters and they will elect anything with emotions without second-thought. But what I'm saying is this: ***waiting until 2027 to vote out this madman, assuming the process even succeeds, will be far too late for the country. By then, the damage may be irreversible.*** Institutions will be damaged, systems compromised, and public trust shattered beyond repair.

Constitutionally or other mechanisms, I believe he has to be **ousted** before the next election. otherwise the survival of our country is hinged on a rigged finish line.

Usually, my nephew takes 2 to 3 hours to finish a meal. It's problematic. We have tried almost everything apart from force feeding him a certain way that traumatised the 7 year old I was.

So, while he's having lunch and I'm having a late late brunch, the nanny come to me and tells me that my nephew just prophesied her death?

I proceed to ask what happened. She proceeds to say that she was watching tv, he went and whispered to her ear, ""Utakufa vibaya wewe!"" 

Left her there stunned and proceeded to continue playing.

This alarms her because in her tradition, if a child so much as to say so and so died, they are gonna die in the next soon or someone close to so and so will kick the bucket.

So this has bugged her for almost the whole day.
Wondering what she's gonna do and who could possibly be sick in her family.

My sister and I, obviously after laughing, we proceed to tell her not to worry and that it's a meme, and that he prolly picked it from my brother who is constantly using it.

And then we explain the whole context and that it's not that his smart-ass saw anything from the future.

I'm not sure if her mind is eased tho.

Kenya,Feed the Future,do you think it's a conspiracy,"I was just sitting and thinking about how fast the world is advancing in terms of technology and infrastructure. The conspiracy is that the more we move forward on this path, the harder it becomes to access wealth and become rich(especially if you already poor) but before that money abundance is going to be felt and then BOOM everything will be moderate, all this is to enrich the governments,

... let me explain, I know sina extensive information kenye inaweza explain this but I think I see it, as Africans our knowledge and skills have been of great part of this advancement but it's hard for people to see it, mostly because of how certain things are presented or who gets credit for them.

We recently saw the rise of AI, and now many countries are putting major effort into automation, robotics, and so on. I know this is progress and it’s good but my concern is that there’s no uniformity. These robots will be built in certain countries, they will become more stable, and eventually, large populations especially most countries in AFrica might no longer be needed.

This is bad because imagine mse atume robots ka thao ziwauwe huku, I know ni funny but nyi mliona kenye ilihappen Palestine plus nmkua X and those people really hate us plus kenye ilihappen Zimbabwe(Rhodesia) at first I thought maybe those guys couldn't feed themselves kumbe hao wazungu walipoison those farms this is how evil those people are, but sometimes its confusing because you can't really say wanatuchukia hivo I mean they send aids and you can apply for a VISA and they will give you and so many other good things.

Anyway, my real concern is that big companies can afford to buy robots that work for them, giving them a huge advantage. ku-compete at that level itakua ngumu, which means it’s going to be harder and harder for ordinary people to get rich.

It feels like the gap between the powerful and the rest of us is only going to widen not because we’re lazy or incapable, but because the game is being redefined I mean we are providing information to them so that it can be used against us. weh imagine mse ame-disappear mysteriously and you can't provide evidence wacha hata hio, imagine uongee kitu ya ujinga alafu Ruto afinye tu button na kichwa yko i-explode, hio place nilisema story na uniformity I think AFricans being the most rich continent we need to get our sh\*t together so that we don't be weak in future when it comes to protecting ourselves and our resources and we are not there yet plus there's no signs which scares me, I would have continued but hii thread imekua long

Kenya,Feed the Future,Betrayal or misunderstood intentions?,"A farmer bought a chick from a market. He fed it, took care of it, in no time it had grown into an adult chicken. The chicken was fond of the farmer, loved him like he was it's mother. The farmer had a guest pay him a visit at his home. Happy to see the visitor, he decided to prepare him a  scrumptious meal.

In that short period of time the chicken was in shock, it wondered why suddenly the farmer had changed.
The chicken in a state of confusion, misunderstood the farmer's intentions to care for it, feeding it for love. The farmer's true intentions was to rear, fatten it so as in the future he may eat it. Not for entertainment, companionship but to consume it. That was it's value to him.

Kenya,Tusome,A Short Story.,"In Medicine, there's something called physical examination of the patient. Here, we usually comment on a patient's general appearance, to establish how affected the patient is. Sometimes they're fatigued and dizzy, and other times they're just bearing the pain silently. 

Now. Today, we happened to meet an Intern Doctor who had some serious family issues, and is quite dependent on cannabis, though not that much. Sasa, there's a lady in labor that we had to examine, to establish how favorable the cervix was before induction of labor. 

The intern folded the sleeves of his white coat, and started off. The issue is that while scoring the cervix, all you need is a speculum and sterile gloves. The consultant was there as well. This Intern goes ahead to comment on the lady's general appearance rather than examining the cervix. He said, ""The woman is suffering.""🤣🤣🤣 He could have said she was in distress or something.

Kenya,Power Africa,"🇰🇪 Why Is Kenya So Spiritually Important,And Why Are We Being ""Preserved""?","Lately I’ve been thinking hard.
With everything going on in Kenya;the rising cost of living, police brutality, youth unrest, and this heaviness in the air,it feels like there’s more happening than meets the eye.

Why is it that Kenya has never been put on harsh travel bans, even when other East African countries were targeted?
Why did the new Pope visit Kenya months before his election?
Why is there this suspicious peace the world seems to have with Kenya?

Could it be because Kenya is not just another African country?

Let me explain:

🔑 There’s Something Deeper About This Land:

Mt. Kenya (Kirinyaga) is believed to be the home of God (Ngai) in Kikuyu tradition. That’s not just myth,it’s power.

The Rift Valley literally splits the continent, but spiritually, it’s like a sacred scar running through our land.

Elders say this land has strong ancestral energy,you can feel it in the trees, rivers, hills, and stones.

Before colonizers came, people did ceremonies on specific land points;spiritual gates. Then, the British built churches right on top of those sacred sites.

They knew.

✋🏾 And Yet, Look at What’s Going On:

Kenya is a UN headquarters, a US drone base, and a hub for global surveillance.

The world watches us but doesn't move against us. You don’t “crush” a place you still plan to use.

So maybe Kenya is being “spared” not out of mercy,but because it’s too important to the systems at play.

So I ask:

Could it be that Kenya holds a deeper purpose?
Are we sitting on an ancient energy gate?
Is that why we’re being watched,but not destroyed?

Dr. Mumbi once said, ""Kenya is the spiritual heart of Africa."" I believe her.

Because I’ve felt it. Maybe you’ve felt it too,the pull, the awakening.

🔮 What if our ancestors knew something the world forgot?

What if the energy here can’t be colonized forever?

What if our generation is meant to reclaim it spiritually, mentally, and politically?


I want to connect with anyone who’s been thinking like this.
If you know anything;books, links, elders, TikToks, even dreams,let’s talk.

Kenya,Power Africa,To our leaders;," To the Leaders of Africa: There is a storm rising. And it will not wait for protocol.
You have stolen enough. Enriched yourselves, your friends, and your families while the people who put you in power sleep on empty stomachs. Every time your private jets take to the skies, remember: the cost of just one hour in the air can feed 100 hungry families,families you were sworn to protect, not starve. The fuel that powers your endless convoys could carry the struggling citizen to work for an entire month. Yet you burn it like it means nothing. You flaunt wealth as if the suffering eyes watching you from the roadside do not matter,as if the dust they choke on while your luxury cars speed past will never turn into fire. But hear this clearly: the poor you rob to feed your greed are not blind. They are hungry. And when a people have nothing left to eat, they will eat the rich.
You send wealth to foreign banks, to London and Dubai, as if those vaults will shelter your children when your country falls. You invest abroad while your country decays beneath your feet,forgetting that no western savings account can save a nation on the brink. In the end, your foreign investments will not preserve you; they will bury the country you are meant to lead. And soon, even those investments will lose value, just like the trust your people once had in you. You are not gods. You are not untouchable. You are public servants. And the patience of the poor has limits.
So choose now,serve the people, or face what comes when they finally realize their only meal left... is you.",1749152847.0,2025-06-05 19:47:27,1,0,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l48ovl/to_our_leaders/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l48ovl/to_our_leaders/
Kenya,Power Africa,We're standing at a cliff's edge,"Good evening, fellow Kenyans...
.It just hit me that we're standing on the precipice of great change in this country. With the newly proposed finance bill, it looks like there's gonna be some serious protests, followed by extra judicial killings.

Oh wait, I've seen this before. It was last year. Currently it looks like we're in a repetitive cycle where the government keeps forcing us to tighten our belts some more, then we protest and they withdraw a few steps but move forward by a mile in the next financial year.

The national debt is at 11.36 trillion, having increased by a trillion per year since the new regime came into power but what do we have to show for it?

Nothing, absolutely nothing. Are the services that we're paying for working? Where are the cheap houses that we were promised? All I see is estates for the bourgeois in the outskirts of the capital. Serenity in Rongai is a good example.

Apparently Kibra is going to be the biggest estate in Africa, but what are the plans for it's current residents?

Too many issues to touch on but what can Mwanainchi do? Go protest for a couple of weeks then the government retreats only to advance their agenda later.

In short, it's an era which shall be defined by the revolution for the better or we sink into a total dictatorship where democracy is but a pipe dream.

Call me out for this but I think the Jayden era was a good one, we didn't even care for things like the finance bill, ignorance was bliss. 

Right now we're living in fear of what might happen to us if we're outspoken in criticism against the government. Just you wait till the bill passes and the government has all your personal information regardless of the anonymity of some social media platforms.

Kenya,Power Africa,UON Conned,"ICYMI..

EXCLUSIVE: How an Impostor Brought Kenya’s Premier University to Its Knees
The Curious Case of Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo – The Man Who Staged a Real-Life Thriller at the University of Nairobi
By Investigative Desk
 
If you thought Joshua Waiganjo—the man who posed as a senior police officer—was Kenya’s greatest impostor, think again. A new king of deception has emerged, and his theatre was not a remote police post, but the highest citadel of intellectualism in Kenya: the University of Nairobi (UoN). Meet Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo—a man whose mastery of lies, manipulation, and coercion reads like a Hollywood political thriller. From masquerading as a Catholic priest, senior intelligent [couldn't pronounce it well-how he'd scare people with!] officer to an international fund raiser!
This week, Ouma was finally unmasked and arraigned in court, facing charges of abuse of office, academic fraud, and the unlawful acquisition of over KES 32 million from public coffers. His arrest by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alongside senior Council members of UoN sent shockwaves across Kenya’s academic and governance sectors.
But who is Brian Ouma?
He was once a driver—yes, a driver—assigned to Chancellor Dr Vijoo Rattansi. He swindle d peopke by posing as Rattansi's PA cum bodyguard.But from those humble beginnings, Ouma’s ambitions knew no bounds. He is alleged to have forged academic documents, including an MBA certificate from a reputable university, and used them to armtwist top university official to secure top-level positions at UoN. It is only Prof. Magoha who doubted Ouma's papers and denied him a job. Prof. Magoha saw no peace as Education Cabinet Secretary until he was shiwn the door. Ouma is rumoured to have swore that Prof Magoha would never find peace, and true to hus word, Prof Magoha's attempt to become an Emeritus Professor at UoN were thwarted by Ouma! To ascend to what he referred as the 'table', Ouma manipulated University Council processes to rewrite governance structures, and eventually self-styled himself as The Chief Operations Officer (COO)—a role he created and appointed himself to. The university statutes do not have this position.
Insiders say he was so brazen that he drafted proposals to restructure the university’s governance system to weaken the Vice-Chancellor’s role and centralise all power under the COO—himself. His argument was thst a Vice-Chancellor need not be a Professor as their preview is in classrooms. At one point, he even plotted to become the Vice-Chancellor without holding a single recognised academic qualification. He would bypass the Ministry of Education, dismiss the role of the Cabinet Secretary as “cosmetic,” and advised the Council to unilaterally install his preferred Vice Chancellor!
Worse still, he allegedly  named in a scandal where he influenced the admission of unqualified students into the competitive Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Paediatrics programmes without merit. What began as fraud escalated into what could be considered educational sabotage. If true, this borders on criminal negligence—entrusting human lives to unqualified medics.
But that was not all.
Brian turned the university into his private estate. He sidelined directors, installed cronies, intimidated staff, and reportedly ran a parallel government within the institution. He filed dozens of court cases, paralysing UoN's operations and reforms. Over 400 cases are linked to his faction, turning the judiciary into his preferred tool of resistance.
He then ventured into tenderpreneurship, allegedly looting endowment funds meant for student scholarships and research. He broke deals over UoN land and dished out contracts like political favours.Any line officer who dared question his underhand deals would regret dearly. The infamous transfers of senior officers by the Council Chairman was as a result of the bad blood occasioned by Brian.Sources claim that Council members received “tokens of appreciation” to keep him in power. Council members who wouldn't toll the line are forced to resign or their appointments revoked.Through a network of enablers, he destroyed the careers of five Vice-Chancellors—Prof. Mbithi, Prof. Mbeche, Prof. Ogot, Prof. Ogeng’o, and Prof. Kiama—as well as countless administrators and technical staff who dared question his authority. The current hullabaloo at UoN is as a result of the current Vice-Chancellor refusing to give in to Ouma's demands.
The result? A once world-class university now faces over KES 13 billion in pending bills, crumbling infrastructure, and a deeply demoralised workforce. His reign pushed UoN into conflict with government, compromised its national reputation, and reversed decades of academic progress.
Brian Ouma is no ordinary impostor. He has an insatiable appetite for power. He did not stop at impersonation; he reimagined and rewrote the very fabric of governance at Kenya’s most iconic university—unchecked and unchallenged, until now.
As he now stands before the courts, Kenyans are left asking: How could the intellectual powerhouse of East Africa fall for such a man? And how many more “Brians” are hiding in our institutions?
For now, justice may finally be catching up with the man who made deception a job description. But the damage he has inflicted on UoN—and on public trust—may take years to undo.",1747805273.0,2025-05-21 05:27:53,3,6,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1krq5qu/uon_conned/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1krq5qu/uon_conned/

Kenya,Power Africa,do you think it's a conspiracy,"I was just sitting and thinking about how fast the world is advancing in terms of technology and infrastructure. The conspiracy is that the more we move forward on this path, the harder it becomes to access wealth and become rich(especially if you already poor) but before that money abundance is going to be felt and then BOOM everything will be moderate, all this is to enrich the governments,

... let me explain, I know sina extensive information kenye inaweza explain this but I think I see it, as Africans our knowledge and skills have been of great part of this advancement but it's hard for people to see it, mostly because of how certain things are presented or who gets credit for them.

We recently saw the rise of AI, and now many countries are putting major effort into automation, robotics, and so on. I know this is progress and it’s good but my concern is that there’s no uniformity. These robots will be built in certain countries, they will become more stable, and eventually, large populations especially most countries in AFrica might no longer be needed.

This is bad because imagine mse atume robots ka thao ziwauwe huku, I know ni funny but nyi mliona kenye ilihappen Palestine plus nmkua X and those people really hate us plus kenye ilihappen Zimbabwe(Rhodesia) at first I thought maybe those guys couldn't feed themselves kumbe hao wazungu walipoison those farms this is how evil those people are, but sometimes its confusing because you can't really say wanatuchukia hivo I mean they send aids and you can apply for a VISA and they will give you and so many other good things.

Anyway, my real concern is that big companies can afford to buy robots that work for them, giving them a huge advantage. ku-compete at that level itakua ngumu, which means it’s going to be harder and harder for ordinary people to get rich.

It feels like the gap between the powerful and the rest of us is only going to widen not because we’re lazy or incapable, but because the game is being redefined I mean we are providing information to them so that it can be used against us. weh imagine mse ame-disappear mysteriously and you can't provide evidence wacha hata hio, imagine uongee kitu ya ujinga alafu Ruto afinye tu button na kichwa yko i-explode, hio place nilisema story na uniformity I think AFricans being the most rich continent we need to get our sh\*t together so that we don't be weak in future when it comes to protecting ourselves and our resources and we are not there yet plus there's no signs which scares me, I would have continued but hii thread imekua long

Kenya,Power Africa,"I think colonialism is just a convenient excuse, when it comes to how & why we favor colonizers and give them preferential treatment over our fellow black/Africans.","

Let's have a discussion. Colonialism ended 60+ yrs ago. That means that anyone 60 and below didn't experience colonialism. The effects - Colonialism ended but effects are still alive. This comment is usually thrown around casually. So let's unpack it. What effects are we talking really about?

Let's talk from an example of a twenty-or-thirty-year-old customer care server allowing colonizers to jump the queue at the bank, or guards only searching locals and similar form of preferential treatment and discrimination to locals. This happens a lot! The worst place I have seen this is Safaricom shop. Everyone is queing, and out of nowhere comes a colonizer and immediately the agents starts attending to them, whilst thirty locals have been waiting for hours.  

 If its in Europe, the reverse would happen. I have seen it alot in government building. You are queuing in a government office in Frankfurt waiting for service, then a local comes and is served before you, sometimes it's not one or two people. They will jump the queue for their own people and lie to you straight in the face that his/hers was a priority because they're needed for work, they have a family or other dumb excuse. Point is, they will always put their own before anyone else. Back in Africa it's the complete opposite, we not only treat our own poorly, but commit an injustice and give a preferential service to outsiders.

Yet, you will time from time see colonialism taking the blame whenever there is an incidents arise. If not colonialism, it's it's effects. Colonialism ended 60+ yrs ago. Is it really sincere to continue blaming colonialism or its supposed effects? More importantly, what exact effect are we really talking about? Because it is really misused.

Colonialism in Africa utilised brutalism and physical force, rather than mental/psychological tools or soft power. They used hard power:  guns and violence to suppress resistance and take power. Colonizers were also not interested in creating a favourable perception or image of themselves. They ruled with iron fist: absolute violence, forced labor and land theft. Even for the tribes that collaborated, Africans saw colonizers as oppressors. Collaboration was mainly from a place of fear. So, no one wanted them to stay.  So, there was absolutely no admiration for them. There was no room for any positive emotions nor perceptions towards Europeans. So, what or which effect of colonialsm would make a black African treat their own poorly, and favor the son or daughter of the colonizer sixty year later?

In contrast, in some places in Asia and Latin America, Europeans invaders utilized a different strategy: psychological tools, soft power, propaganda to indoctrinate masses using white supremacist ideologies and plant a favourable opinion and perception in the minds of the natives. The main idea was to manipulate natives into accepting the invaders and view them as emancipatory, rather than oppressors. The subliminal messaging was Europeans were coming to help them overcome systematic challenges and create advancement/development. They had very positive perceptions of colonialsm. Good example is Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore. 

Also, there were no television, mobile phones or radios that would assumebly be used to indoctrinate people with white supremacist notions, European beauty standards push or trigger inferiority complex amongst Africans. 

I find it extremely insincere, downright deceitful and sneaky escapism to attribute colonialism as the cause of poor treatment of fellow Africans and preferential treatment of colonizers. It is a quick and easy means to avoid self introspection, accountability. Saying colonialsm is the cause is rather a more of a convenience to absolve ourselves of moral failures. 


You know, on the surface it's not such a big deal. But looking at it from a psychological, instinctual and survival perspective, it's such a deeply fucked utopian shit. Completely abnormal and hostile behaviour towards ourselves, and our survival as a collective.

Kenya,Power Africa,If I Could Only Share One Piece of Advice: Why Betting on Yourself Beats Everything Else,"Saw a post here on Reddit where someone asked:
“What’s one skill you don’t regret learning?”

My Honest answer? Every single one.

Even the ones that didn’t pay. Even the ones that led to dead ends. Even the ones I learned out of pure survival mode.

Because each one taught me something about myself—and somehow, they’ve all come full circle.

I joined uni to study Construction Engineering. You know, that classic “My son is doing engineering” line parents love to parade at chama meetings. Deep down though? I knew I was lying to myself. No passion. No curiosity. Just burnout. By end of 2nd year, I was mentally and emotionally tapped out. Don't joke with Structures.

Then TikTok did its thing.

Elvis Warutomo popped up on my For You page talking about online skills. That one video lit something in me.

I started with email marketing on Hubspot academy. Got certified. Went crazy with cold outreach—over 1,000 DMs and emails.Switched to various nitches; beauty, real estate, fitness , health, Saas and many others. I was hungry. But not a single gig after one full year.(Had to go to mjengo to survive)

So I switched lanes. Taught myself frontend dev on FreeCodeCamp—HTML, CSS, JS. Still, no clients. Zero traction.

Then I picked up Python. Mosh on YouTube became my virtual mentor. I didn’t finish the course, but luckily life threw me into AI training jobs on Remotasks and Outlier. I did my part for cents, but the money helped me stay afloat.

Somewhere along the way, I discovered copywriting. Didn’t take it seriously at first—just something to pass time. But it unlocked a new way of thinking. I even dabbled in business strategy and marketing. Started imagining what it’d look like to run something of my own someday.

I took that knowledge and grew my LinkedIn to around 1,570 followers—organically. No ads, just consistency.

Eventually, a 4th-year Software Engineer friend needed help with his final project. I helped built him a full POS system using Python and some business logic. Combined everything I’d learned. I didn’t get paid, but he passed with flying colors. That win? Mine too.

Then crypto entered the chat.

I’d been slowly accumulating Pepe—every dip, I added a little. $10 here, $5 there. I don’t save. I invest. If money sits, it rots.

Pepe pumped from around $0.000006 to $0.00002850 within a certain period of time. I exited at 0.000021. Pocketed around $400 profit.(Took about 5 —7 months) Cashed out $150 to handle bills and bought TON at around $6-8.

Then the bear came.

TON tanked to $3. I panicked and sold. What was left? Just $77.

But instead of folding, I had been studying margin trading on YouTube. Understood the risk. Watched every isolated margin explainer I could find. Learned about leverage. Volume. Momentum.

Then came a weird night.

Some guy on TradingView—goes by Xanos—posted saying BTC would dump at $84,500. I’d followed him long enough to know… he’s usually wrong. The man is basically a contrarian signal.

I checked the charts. Volume was strong. Buyers were hungry.

So I did the craziest thing—I threw that $77 into a 125x leveraged long.

Then I turned off my phone. And slept.

Woke up to BTC at $87,000.

Account? Sitting at around $360.

In one night, I’d bounced back. 

And yo, I almost didn’t make it to that moment.


A while back, I hit rock bottom. So desperate, I almost gave in to carding. My curiosity took over, and I started studying it. I’m great at finding valuable resources, so I hunted down some leaked courses, found them, and spent days learning the ins and outs. I even met a random guy online who was selling non-VBV cards—and for a moment, I actually considered it. I was that low.

(BEWARE 90% of càrd sellers online are scammers aiming to drain your pockets)

I won’t lie—there’s a part of me that still carries anger toward the systems that messed us up. Colonization didn’t just take our land, it buried generations of potential. Sometimes, I feel like scamming the system back would be justice.

But deep down, I know my ancestors didn’t fight so I could lose myself in shortcuts. That’s not power. That’s desperation disguised as rebellion.

So I stepped away. I want to win clean. Build slow. But build real.

Funny twist—I met a cybersecurity expert at a burial. We vibed. Now I’m back on the learning path , I'm now locked in for the next six months with a small crew of like-minded bros. We're building again. Quietly, but surely.

Still, the mental toll has been real.

I’ve been through depression. Sleepless nights. Felt useless. Hopeless. And don’t even get me started on dating in this generation—love feels like a marketing scam now. I had to fall back and heal first. My peace comes first.

And honestly? I realized most of my anxiety came from worrying about a future that hadn’t even happened. So I decided to live in the now. Control what I can. Leave the rest to the Divine.

I don’t fully know who I am yet. But I know this:

I’m a firstborn son. Middle-class background. Parents aging. Siblings looking up to me. Pressure's real. I carry it daily. And still—I refuse to break. Never will.

One day I’ll look back at this post and smile. Because I know I’ll make it. I have to.

Kenya needs healing. Africa needs rebuilding. But before I save anyone else—I’ve got to save me and my people first.

Maybe we need another maandamano to let this pain out, lol. If you know, you know.

Anyway—I pray you reading this make it too.

Because everyone’s fighting a battle they don’t post about. So please, don’t worry too much about tomorrow. Do what you can today. Let the universe meet you halfway.

I’m not where I want to be, but I’m not where I was.

So as long as I’m growing—mentally, physically, spiritually—I’m winning.

And so are you.

If you ever get a money-making plug, don’t hoard it. Share it. That’s how we all rise. The bag is infinite for all of us. Mama told me that. I believe her.

Money is energy. When you share a way to earn it, the universe returns the favor. Always.

Peace. God bless Kenya 🇰🇪 The land we love and adore.A land full of opportunities and crazy 🤪 hardworking Citizens.

Kenya,Power Africa,"The undeniable, haunting truth, one so evil, you can’t begin to grasp it, lurks far beyond what you think you know.","I may not fully agree with Dagoretti MP KJ Kiarie on everything, especially his defensive stance regarding KDF soldiers during the Finance Bill protests and the recent BBC exposé but I must say, I stand with him on what he said about BATUK soldiers.

Having lived in Nanyuki from the age of 14 to 21 a solid seven years I’ve seen things that still unsettle me. And if you believe you've encountered evil, allow me to tell you this: whatever you've faced is merely a shadow compared to what British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) soldiers have done in that town.

The horror stories are not just whispers. These are well-documented crimes articles of rape, assault, and even murder, mostly targeting vulnerable women, particularly sex workers. At one point, the situation got so bad that their own commander had to caution them against sleeping with too many local women because they were contracting STIs. an article on the rape stories  was covered by journalist Larry Madowo in CNN’s report: [CNN article](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/17/africa/british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl).

Another troubling read is from Leigh Day, shedding light on how sexual violence against women persists wherever the British army sets up shop: [Leigh Day article](https://www.leighday.co.uk/news/blog/elimination-of-violence-against-women/sexual-violence-against-women-where-the-british-army-trains-in-kenya-continues-to-be-reported/) and so many if you just search BATUK soldiers in Kenya on google. 

And let us never forget Agnes Wanjiru. She was just 21 when she vanished in March 2012. Last seen with British soldiers in a Nanyuki hotel bar, her body was found two months later in a septic tank. And to make things worse, those soldiers went online and laughed about it. That is not just criminal it is inhumane.

Sometimes I wonder: are we really free as a country? Because how else do you justify the continued presence of a UK military base in Kenya when we have our own defense forces? It reeks of neocolonialism, our land, our people, still being disrespected in ways that echo colonial violence and not just Kenya. All African countries have colonial military base. 

No matter where you stand politically, these truths cannot be ignored.

  
If any African claims the continent is free from colonization, I say this with all due respect  that’s dumb. We're not free; we’re just no longer in visible chains. 

That’s the only difference. Colonial power never left,  it simply changed form.

Kenya,Power Africa,Missed the SGR... Ended Up Discovering the Real Kenya Instead 🇰🇪,"I missed the damn SGR train from Nairobi to Voi. That’s how this started.

But instead of sulking, I hopped on a local bus and unknowingly unlocked one of the most real, unfiltered, and unexpectedly powerful road trips I’ve ever had in Kenya.

From random stops and DJ-style bus entertainment, to scenic views and a front-row seat to the hustle of everyday Kenyans — this ride reminded me why public transport is a cultural experience of its own. And guess what? I still made it to Taita *before* the train. 😂

I documented everything here:

But it’s bigger than the journey. I was headed to Taita Taveta for a 6-day creator tour to spotlight it as East Africa’s next tourism and mining gem — and what I found along the way deserves more attention.

Why do we underrate experiences like this? Why does everyone chase “VIP luxury” and miss out on the real richness of this country?

Kenya,Power Africa,"Not all skin folks are kin folks: Black American state operatives, espionage against Africans, for white power structures.","
This is an example of one of the many black American kin folks under pentagon/state department rats working for white power structure against Africans. He started his espionage assignment in 1996 in Senegal, then later moves to Uganda where he camouflaged as a music teacher and singer until 2019.

His job, in his own words, “was to spot, assess, develop, and recruit spies to help our nation."" 

These are the kind of rats that have no conscience in helping white supremacists maintain their control and continue keeping black Americans down through systemic assassination of black American rights activists like Malcolm X and Martin Luther. 


In the ideal world, black Americans would be valuable resource to Africa in terms of tourism, capital and skills. They posses unique experience and exposure. However, looking at how they've systematically backstabbed their own back home, it's a guarantee these people will be no different here. 
In fact, it is almost certain they they are going to work against us, even more confidently and treacherous than their white folks. Skin colour gives them unchallenged advantages in matters espionage. They can easily blend in. Black, they look like us, they are our people, king lost kins. Most importantly, the average African mind does not immediately suspect them, nor sees them as potential enemies in national, political and economic matters compared to white males who are the embodiment of white supremacism, colonialism, treachery, murder and plunder of the Africa. These makes black Americans unparalleled capabilities for espionage in Africa, even more lethal enemies than their white counterparts. 

It's almost certain this newly-found love towards Kenya, and Africa at large, is not organic. 

To begin with, they are equally racist, if not more, to Africans compared to their white counterparts. 

Almost all of these akatas have no families, they're coming as individuals, no wife/husband, no children, no clear reason why they are ""moving"" here, no clear income generating activity. Like who are they? Are they conservationists? Are they coming for business? Are they employed? I mean, Kenya is extremely expensive, especually for foreigners.

Kenya,Power Africa,The BBC documentary,"So if you haven’t watched it i will give a brief: 

The BBC Africa Eye documentary Blood Parliament investigates the tragic events of June 25, 2024, when Kenyan security forces(national police service +KDF) opened fire on peaceful Gen Z protesters outside Parliament. 

The protest, sparked by opposition to the controversial Finance Bill, ended in bloodshed as both police and KDF officers used live ammunition, resulting in several deaths and injuries. 
Through verified videos, forensic analysis, and witness accounts, the documentary identifies specific officers involved in the gross murders .I literally cried during the documentary. 

The ironical part is that the police is supposed to serve and protect not the opposite. I think genuinely officers should be taken through a psychological evaluation if you aren’t  highly emotionally intelligent don’t get the power and the weapon. Anyway what is your experience watching the documentary and thoughts ?

Kenya,Power Africa,The genesis of Africa’s developmental challenge,"The main challenge with Africa isn’t that there aren’t resources or that Africans are some how inferior to other places or peoples:

It’s that African elites don’t see the need to invest in their people. They find it more profitable to extort and exploit citizens and live as second class citizens in other people’s capitals in Europe and America.

Countries don’t develop because the people are special or they run into some huge sum of money. Countries develop when the political elites and economic elites to decide to extend their power for purposes that improve the quality of life for fellow citizens. This hasn’t happened in Africa in general, and worse off in non democracies.

So the question is not whether Africa should pursue a Chinese model or an American model. It about a political culture and institutional culture that forces both the economic and political class to see the benefit of investing in their respective countries, so that they would good for themselves in the process. The cost of underdevelopment should hurt them first.

Economic models like state led, free enterprise, or mixed methods often lead to the same outcome without a change in the political culture of the society.

We have a culture problem. And it’s not a culture of being less than as Africans, it’s a culture of exploitation, arrogance, and limited faith in ourselves or our people.",1745504708.0,2025-04-24 14:25:08,6,4,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k6tjib/the_genesis_of_africas_developmental_challenge/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k6tjib/the_genesis_of_africas_developmental_challenge/
Kenya,Power Africa,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,Power Africa,Islam and the end times- Here is Wisdom,"There is a compelling case — often overlooked or dismissed — that Islam may be the religion from which the Antichrist emerges, or through which his system is empowered. Consider the following:

**Denial of Christ’s Divinity and Sacrifice**  
Islam is the only major world religion that explicitly and vehemently denies that Jesus is the Son of God. In fact, it makes this denial a core doctrine. The Qur’an states that saying ""God has a son"" is a grievous sin, worthy of eternal punishment. The religion also explicitly denies that Christ dies and posits a replacement theory that says God switched Christ with Judas, thus invalidating the Sacrifice upon which the whole of Christianity is based. This direct contradiction of Christian belief aligns eerily with the biblical description of the Antichrist as one who denies the Father, the Son (1 John 2:22) and disturbingly specifically denies the exact belief you need for Salvation, the belief that Jesus is the Son of God and God gave His Son to die for your Sins. That is not coincidence- that's prophecy unfolding.

**Execution of Christians by Beheading**  
Revelation 20:4 describes the method of execution of saints during the Great Tribulation at the end time as Beheading. While many regimes e.g. China, have persecuted Christians, Islam is uniquely and consistently associated with beheading, both historically and currently. It’s not only practiced — it’s defended as religiously justified. The most recent beheadings in Congo of 70 Christians are an illustration of this method. Not a coincidence.

**A Political-Religious System**  
Islam isn’t merely a personal faith — it is also a political ideology, with a history of merging religion and state power. TSee Iran and Turkey and most of Middle East. \]he concept of the Ummah (global Islamic community under one caliphate) reflects the sort of unified religious-political structure that would be required to control commerce, impose global edicts, and carry out widespread persecution, as described in Revelation. We have already had a preview of this with ISIS and how rapidly and widely it united muslims once the idea of a Caliphate was announced. And we saw exactly a preview of what is coming in the future.

**The Mahdi: A Mirror of the Antichrist**  
Islamic eschatology includes the rise of a powerful leader known as the Mahdi, who will unite the Muslim world, establish justice, and rule for seven years — eerily similar to the biblical Antichrist. Some interpretations even expect him to work with Isa (the Islamic Jesus) to break crosses, kill pigs, and abolish Christianity as it is known — a narrative that mirrors persecution of believers during the end times:

* **Mahdi**: Expected to rise as a global ruler who unites the Muslim world and establishes a just Islamic caliphate. | **Antichrist**: Will rise as a global leader with unprecedented authority and power, establishing a political system that dominates the world.
* **Mahdi**: Many Islamic traditions say he will rule for **seven years** before the Day of Judgment. | **Antichrist**: In Christian prophecy, the Antichrist confirms a **seven-year covenant** (Daniel 9:27), during which he rules — with the latter half marked by extreme persecution.
* **Mahdi**: Will lead military campaigns to conquer enemies of Islam, including Christians and Jews. | **Antichrist**: Will engage in global warfare, conquering nations and beheading saints.
* **Mahdi**: Will conquer Jerusalem and establish Islamic rule there, possibly even overseeing a new temple or mosque on the Mount. | **Antichrist**: Enters the rebuilt temple, proclaims himself divine, and desecrates it (the “abomination of desolation”).

**The Dajjal: A Mirror of Christ**  
In Islamic eschatology, the Dajjal is the ultimate deceiver — a false messiah who will claim divinity, perform miracles, and lead people astray. Yet, when viewed through a Christian prophetic lens, this figure's traits align not with the Antichrist, but uncannily with the returning Jesus Christ:

* **Dajjal:** Will claim to be divine and demand allegiance from all who see him. | **Christ**: Returns as King of Kings, claiming full divine authority (Matthew 28:18) and receiving global worship (Revelation 5:13).
* **Dajjal:** Performs great signs — including killing and appearing to raise the dead — to deceive the masses. | **Christ:** Will return in power and glory, resurrecting the dead and judging all mankind (John 11:25, Revelation 20:12).
* **Dajjal:** Said to travel the world, deceiving people, but unable to enter Mecca and Medina. | **Christ:** Will descend visibly upon His return and gather His elect from the ends of the earth (Matthew 24:30–31).

If the enemy can flip the script so convincingly that the world welcomes the Antichrist as a messiah and rejects Jesus as a deceiver, it would be the ultimate spiritual trap. Especially if that script pre-programs 2 billion people to reject anyone claiming divine authority,- epecially someone coming to Jerusalem and especially someone confronting their peaceful world ruler (Mahdi). It is perfect or as close to perfect as can be.

**The Abomination that Causes Desolation in the Holy Place**  
Islam’s longstanding claim over Jerusalem — especially the Temple Mount — positions it at the center of a specific end-times desecration, called the ""abomination that causes desolation"" by Daniel and by Jesus as a pre-requisite for triggering the final countdown. Given what happened on October 7th, one can easily envision a scenario in which, after a perceived victory over Israel, an Islamic force storms the temple mount and commits one or both of the following two abominations:

1. Commits a slaughtering of Jews that take refuge in the temple or its ruins, and in a macabre display like we have seen previous extremist groups do to churches in conflict zones, desecrates the temple with the corpses of Jews and Christians. see ISIS.
2. Converts the ruins of the Jewish Temple into a Mosque — as a final mark of their Victory. Similar to the attempt of muslims to build a mosque at the site of the Twin Towers attack.

**Numbers and Influence**  
Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world, with over 1.9 billion adherents and growing influence in Africa, Europe, and Asia. It possesses not just the theological components, but also the numerical strength and momentum to fulfill large-scale tribulation and domination — especially in a future global crisis.

**Historical and Doctrinal Hostility to Jews and Christians**  
The Qur’an contains verses that express deep enmity toward Jews and Christians, and some Islamic scholars have interpreted these as a basis for hostility. While many Muslims live peacefully, the doctrinal undercurrent allows for violent persecution, particularly in the context of global jihad and end-time conflict narratives.

**Jizya: A System of Religious Oppression**  
In Islamic law, non-Muslims (especially Jews and Christians) living under Muslim rule must pay the jizya tax — a financial penalty imposed for simply refusing to convert. The jizya system creates a second-class status and fulfills, in spirit, Revelation 13’s warning of a world where people cannot ""buy or sell"" without submission to the system of the Beast.

**Gift Giving: A minor detail easy to overlook**

Revelation 11:10 describes an eerie global reaction to the death of the Two Witnesses, God's end-time prophets:

>The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth

After the 9/11 attacks, there was documented footage in parts of the Palestinian territories showing people dancing, singing, handing out sweets, and giving gifts to celebrate what they believed was a strike against their enemies. Children were filmed receiving candy. The mood was festive, not solemn.

Similar scenes have played out after terrorist attacks on Israelis, with families celebrating and distributing sweets in places like Gaza and parts of Lebanon. In some cases, people declared victory from mosque loudspeakers.

This ritualistic celebration of death, complete with gift-giving, is deeply symbolic — and matches exactly what Revelation describes. It is not found in communist regimes, atheist states, or even among Western secularists. We’ve only seen modern-day previews of this in one particular cultural context: radical Islamic societies.

Kenya,Power Africa,The ICC,"Sometimes, the most important question to ask is simply: why?
We often hear people say, ""The ICC was created to try African leaders,"" but rarely do we pause and ask: why would Europe need a court to try African war criminals? What real stake do they have in, say, someone getting their hands chopped off in Liberia?

The answer we’re usually given is ""human rights."" But let’s be honest—after everything we’ve seen, that’s starting to look more like a smokescreen than a serious motive.

Take this example:
In the 1970s, North Korea ordered about 1,000 Volvos from Sweden. Then they just... didn’t pay. Completely ghosted Sweden. To this day, Volvo is still chasing that debt, but there’s little they can do. And the rest of Europe noticed.

Fast forward to the 1990s—globalization is surging, especially across Asia. But the memory of those unpaid Volvos still lingered. European powers realized that for globalization to work, there needed to be some form of enforceable international justice. Something to stop countries from simply ignoring agreements, debts, or judgments.

That’s where the International Criminal Court (ICC) comes in. Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which rules on state-to-state matters, the ICC was designed to try individuals. Why? Because after the ICJ ruled against the U.S. in the Nicaragua v. USA case (1986), and the U.S. just ignored it, it became clear: ""might is right"" in global politics. But that mindset is incompatible with a truly globalized world.

Still, they couldn’t realistically prosecute Western leaders—it would undermine the very powers setting the system up. And Asia? Not an option either:

- Most Asian countries didn’t ratify the ICC treaty.

- Europe was courting Asia for trade and diplomacy; prosecuting their leaders would risk alienating them.


That left Africa and Latin America. And Africa, with ongoing conflicts and weaker political leverage, became the ideal testing ground.
Many African states were easily pressured into signing the Rome Statute and even arresting their own people, especially in the early 2000s. Thus, the ICC had its early ""examples""—not as a universal court of justice, but as a geopolitical tool to demonstrate that international law had teeth when applied selectively.

The ICC was not born purely out of a love for human rights. Its emergence was shaped by geopolitical needs in a globalizing world, especially after previous institutions like the ICJ proved ineffective against powerful nations. Africa became the stage for this new form of “justice,” not because it was the most in need of it—but because it was the most convenient.",1744025486.0,2025-04-07 11:31:26,12,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtj0kt/the_icc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtj0kt/the_icc/
Kenya,Power Africa,Tech bros & sis! What’s the best path now? Moringa? ALX? Or self-taught?,"Hey fam! So I’ve been diving into tech lately — trying to learn as much as I can. I started from YouTube (yep, the free university) and I’ve already picked up quite a bit:

JavaScript

Python


It’s been a great ride so far — but now I’m at that point where I’m wondering if I should enroll in a more structured course like Moringa School or ALX Africa.

Moringa seems intense and practical — good for fast learners with some base knowledge. ALX is crazy affordable at $5/month, but how’s the depth and job prospects after?

Also considering self-paced stuff like DataCamp or Coursera — especially for data analytics (Python, MySQL, Excel, Power BI/Tableau) then maybe later machine learning and stats.

So I’m asking:

Kenya,Kenya Crops and Dairy,From the same man talking of austerity measures.,"
By Edwin Nyarangi | May 6, 2025

When President William Ruto formed the government, he promised to reduce the number of presidential advisers as part of his austerity measures.

However, Ruto now has at least 20 advisers with some of them serving at the level of Cabinet Secretaries while others are at the level of Principal Secretaries, gobbling up more than Sh1 billion to run their offices annually.

The question being raised is whether the President needs all these advisers, yet he has Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and technocrats in the relevant ministries who are best suited to perform most of the duties assigned to the advisors.

“The number of advisers in my administration is going to be reduced by 50 per cent with immediate effect as part of the austerity measures that we are carrying out in government,” said Ruto in July last year after the Gen Z protests forced him to dissolve the Cabinet.

In less than one year, however, the presidential advisers have increased from about seven to 20, with more likely to join the team, especially with the broad-based arrangement in which the ruling Kenya Kwanza coalition is working with the ODM party.

This is a stark contrast to former President Mwai Kibaki, who had only three advisers during his second term, who included Prof Kivutha Kibwana, the adviser on constitutional and youth affairs and Raphael Tuju, who served as the adviser on media affairs.

Ruto’s advisers include: Makau Mutua, Moses Kuria, David Ndii, Monica Juma, Karisa Nzai, Edward Kisiangani, Joseph Boinnet, Jaoko Oburu, Silvester Kasuku, Harriette Chiggai, Ali Somane, Abdi Guliye, Steven Otieno, Dominic Menjo, Nancy Laibuni, Augustine Cheruiyot, Kennedy Ogeto, Mohammed Hassan, Henry Kinyua and Joe Ager.

Prof Mutua who is the latest to join the Ruto administration after being appointed as a senior adviser for constitutional affairs, is a longtime ally of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and has served as his political adviser for many years.

Kenya,Kenya Crops and Dairy,Anyone here with experience in contract farming for export in Kenya? (Especially red cabbage),"Hi everyone,  

I'm looking to connect with anyone who has experience in contract farming for export in Kenya — particularly those who’ve grown or exported *red cabbage*. I’m a small-scale farmer based in Bomet and am exploring opportunities to work with export companies that source produce under contract arrangements.  

I have a few questions I’d appreciate insights on:

1. **How did you find reliable export companies offering contract farming arrangements?**  
2. **What crops (besides red cabbage) are in high demand under contract farming schemes?**  
3. **What are typical contract terms (e.g., pricing, inputs, extension services)?**  
4. **What should I look out for in a contract to avoid getting exploited?**  
5. **Have you worked with companies like Twiga Foods, Selina Wamucii, or Jade Fresh? What was your experience?**  
6. **How do companies usually handle quality control and rejection of produce?**  
7. **What certifications or standards (e.g., GLOBALG.A.P) are required for cabbage export, and how did you meet them?**  
8. **Are there cooperatives or farmer groups you recommend joining to increase chances of getting a contract?**  
9. **Is red cabbage a viable crop for export right now in terms of demand and profit margins?**  
10. **Any red flags to watch for when entering a new partnership with an export company?**

I’d love to hear your personal stories, recommendations, and lessons learned. Your advice could really help me and others looking to build a sustainable income through contract farming.

Ta!

Kenya,Kenya Crops and Dairy,Closing My Electronics  Repair Shop in Nairobi CBD After 13 Years,"Hey r/kenya,

It’s with a heavy heart that I’m sharing this, but after 13 years of running my electronics repair shop in Nairobi CBD, I’ve decided to close the doors for good. This business has been my life, and it’s been good to me, made decent money over the years, kept the lights on, and built a loyal customer base. But the challenges have piled up, and it’s just become too much to handle.

The biggest issue is the unrepairability of new devices. Modern electronics are designed to be replaced, not fixed, sealed components, proprietary parts, and manufacturers making it harder for small shops like mine to keep up. On top of that, the stress has been relentless. I’m constantly fielding calls from clients at all hours, chasing updates or complaining about delays, which leaves me mentally drained. The working hours are brutal, often 12-hour days, six days a week, with barely any time for myself or my family. Managing three employees hasn’t helped either; dealing with their schedules, conflicts, and performance issues has added another layer of stress I didn’t sign up for. Combine all that with rising costs and the pressure to stay competitive, and it’s just not sustainable anymore.

I’m not leaving the grind entirely, though. I’m moving into dairy farming and dipping my toes into electrical work out in the field. It’s a big shift, but I’m excited for a change of pace and something that feels more tangible and less overwhelming.

To everyone who’s supported the shop, my customers, suppliers, and even the random redditors who’d pop by after seeing my posts here, thank you.  It’s time for a new chapter.",1745262072.0,2025-04-21 19:01:12,256,45,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k4lkwh/closing_my_electronics_repair_shop_in_nairobi_cbd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k4lkwh/closing_my_electronics_repair_shop_in_nairobi_cbd/
Kenya,WASH Kenya,This part of my life is called Homeless and Jobless...an update.,"Hey Redditors, it’s me again with an update from last week’s post!

Four days ago, on June 5th, the street kitchen in Githurai where I was washing dishes let go of three of us (out of six) because the owner couldn’t afford to pay us anymore. On top of that, he owes us 10 days’ pay, which has left me in a tough spot.

I’m still homeless, now jobless, and the cold benches lately have been a real challenge—but I’m holding on! The chilly mornings make it harder to rest, and I’m feeling the strain more each day, yet I refuse to give up.

I’m throwing myself to any and all kind of work—content writing, editing, odd jobs, Car wash gigs, you name it! Whether it’s crafting SEO articles, polishing text, or tackling manual tasks, I’m eager to prove my worth.

If you’ve got a lead, I’d love to hear from you. I’m still believing in a turnaround, and even a small gig could change my story.

The thought of steady work keeps me going, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.

This might not resonate with all, but if you possess any valuable leads, that would be great. . Let’s keep pushing together, step by step, toward better days! Below is the link to my previous post.

1. No amount of pineapples will make your butt crack smell good, please wash it with a piece of soft cloth and soap.
2. Schedule your 💩 sessions with your showers so either poop in the morning or evening 
3. Practice sexual hygiene, you can’t be changing patners every week and get away with it, also condoms are great.
4.  Eat healthy, drop the KFC and go heavy on the vegetables (they are cheaper too).
5. Two showers a day is not too much if you live in Kenya.
6. Dry your parts well after the shower .
7. Wash your braids please, there’s a certain smell that comes when you have them in for long
8. Pee immediately after sex and drink loads of water the next day just to make sure you keep on peeing , I don’t know how to explain this but to me it’s like flashing the semen out of your body
9. There’s no reason you have underwear from 4 years ago , change your underwear as often as you can afford to .
10. Check your man as well, what he eats (food and otherwise)..
11. If a man has bad breath don’t let him go down on you, you risk a yeast infection as bad breath usually comes from bacteria in the mouth.

Kenya,Youth program,We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

Kenya,USAID,Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke.

Kenya,foreign aid,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,foreign aid,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,5,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/
Kenya,foreign aid,Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",1743469962.0,2025-04-01 01:12:42,119,124,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Kenya,Trump aid cuts,"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”

Kenya,Trump aid cuts,The big fat smelly lie of Muslim brotherhood/ummah,"Just before the Palestine genocide started, there was a very fierce Muslim propaganda across the internet. Especially platforms like Twitter. Salafists in UK, Europe and Americas were having a field day man. They were so aggressive and so arrogant. You couldn't miss a day without viral post of salafists, Daawah cult and clerics.  
  
What's crazy is how quickly they vanished when the genocide started. The big fat lie of Muslim Ummah & brotherhood quickly exposed. Isn't it incredible how it has fallen. It's actually a big clown shit show, full of deception, shameless hypocrisy, blatant corruption, and manipulation. Just a shitload of moral empty grandstanding and virtual signaling. Their clerics don't even have the balls to directly call out Israel for the genocide.

Kenya,development funding,Alleged Abduction of Kenyan MP George Koimburi Amid Political Tensions,"On 25 May 2025, George Koimburi, Member of Parliament for Juja, was allegedly abducted outside the Full Gospel Church in Mugutha, Kiambu County, Kenya, by unidentified individuals and was found the following day, injured and unconscious, at a coffee plantation in Ruiru, approximately 10 kilometres away. He is currently receiving medical treatment at Karen Hospital in Nairobi.   
  
The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

Kenya,development funding,Pointless argument,"So this lad, maybe 5 years older than me joined the school staff as a bom teacher of math and computer studies (Same combo as mine) like two weeks ago. I'm mostly introverted hence never initiate any conversation in the department. So we mostly stay in the math department due to obvious reasons. I just noticed the guy trying to edit the source code of a website on the department desktop.

 In my mind was like, this are the people we can reason together. Not long after,  a  colleague saw what he was doing and started praising him and even said we should join hands and develop an app like zeraki and get money from it since the school was paying 100k annually for the service. I told the lads that's not possible (without funding), zeraki is big plus they have good marketing strategy.

I was shocked to hear the computer guy talking about local host (saa iyo ako na 4th generation laptop inakaa oven). Nilijaribu hadi kuwaonyesha the AWS host zeraki are using, the lads ignorantly claimed the owners had their own servers.

We switched to talking about laptops, the computer teacher ashaa sema he'll prefer an older laptop (4th generation and below) over any other laptop. 

The guy doesn't even understand the concept of processor generations, doesn't consider the type C technology (a computer teacher calling a micro USB normal cable/ type B?), slim design, energy efficiency (less heat emission), SSD, and faster RAM, multicores and other good stuff that come with latest technology laptops. 

I just mentioned my Lenovo laptop...."" Bro Lenovo ni the worst brand, itaanza kuzima"" I'm like bro, Lenovo is a giant in the laptop market share, actually the oldest from the days of IBM. I've used Lenovo since form 2 and never experienced that.

Plus what would be the value of a refurbished budget phone? She bought the phone new. 

The best solution (which both guys wouldn't comprehend) was installing a custom ROM, routing the phone or just buying a better midrange phone./ budget Samsung phone which can rarely have such mediocrity.

Kenya,development funding,We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

First, sijalipwa na mtu. I am expressing my thoughts based on my observations over the last year. Anyway, I just watched the BBC documentary and the fact that the commercial activists are the faces of J25 doesn't sit well with me. I still maintain that J25 was not organic to a great extent. Money exchanged hands and a lot of it. As much as the finance bill protest was meant for Kenyans to collectively push against punitive taxes, an unseen hand funded and pulled the strings. The finance bill was the perfect opportunity for this person or group of people to strike. I also don't think that this person or group of people had the interests of Kenyans at heart. The way those protests started and fizzled out is an indicator.

I know this is an echo chamber, same as KOX but I am not going to hold back. I was skeptical of commercial activists from the word go. If you guys can recall the first day of the protests, these guys casually gave themselves up to the police. It was like a photo op. Casually following the cops, extending their hands to grab the rope that hangs from the back of the lorry and hoisting themselves inside. These guys were even smiling inside there, no chants, just banter as other Kenyans were running and getting teargassed. Their body language was so telling. I voiced that on X. Of course I got bashed, for asking that question I was called a misogynist as if Boniface Mwangi is a woman or a trans guy.

You guys, do not think for once that these activists stand for the same values as you. Remember Boniface Mwangi was supporting Raila, even after this con man revealed his cabinet of criminals and drug dealers like this cocaine guy from Mombasa, Joho? He stood with the same side that was funded by Uhuru Kenyatta, a looter, land grabber, and economic assassin. Which values was he standing for exactly? I believe these guys kina Boni, Hanifa, Njeri, Shakira, and most of the people who were captured in those awe-inspiring patriotic moments were paid. It was not a coincidence. Also note that they used a lot of women, psychological tacts to use misogyny as a defense when people start raising questions.

I want to remind you that these people do not share the struggle with ordinary Kenyans. These guys are well-funded, they have money. If things went south, they would be granted asylum in some of the most developed countries in a heartbeat. They probably always have their passports ready and an exit plan. It is ordinary Kenyans who were killed and injured during those protests, these activists were not even in the frontlines. I laugh when I see people propose that some of these people deserve political seats because they are activists. This is the same system of using political seats as gifts we are up against yet people want to perpetuate it. Tf is wrong with Kenyans?

What I'm saying is we need to separate our struggle from these activists. They can join us in agitating but don't think they are in it because they are so patriotic. If it wasn't for the money, how sure are you they would be doing it? They don't deserve political seats because they are activists. Mohamed Ali was an investigative journalist but after getting elected he sided with the oppressor, same with John Kiarie, a political satirist. We need a second wave of agitating for change but we must decenter the movement from commercial activists. Their moves, intentions, and sources of funding can easily be used to discredit an otherwise innocent and genuine struggle for change.",1745820876.0,2025-04-28 06:14:36,10,9,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k9orkn/separating_modern_political_struggle_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k9orkn/separating_modern_political_struggle_from/
Kenya,development funding,Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Sometimes, it’s good to understand the nuances too.",1745563462.0,2025-04-25 06:44:22,6,17,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/
Kenya,development funding,Private Equity Funds in Kenya,"You may not be aware, but many of our expenditures today benefit Private Equity (PE) funds. They are crowding into Kenya to get a piece of the pie. With our lax laws and poor regulation, these funds are having a field day.

PE funds now own or back Java, Naivas, Quickmart, Goodlife Pharmacies, and several private hospitals. We’re even considering PE funds for the Nairobi–Mombasa toll road.

We all know their endgame: high shareholder returns and flipping the business for a profit. It's no wonder Java has near-monthly price hikes. 

We’re gradually losing control of essential sectors to entities whose primary concern is not service or affordability but short-term financial gain. With limited public oversight, this trend will likely continue unchecked.

Do you think we should be worried? Or is this just the price of development?

Kenya,development funding,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,development funding,Why are we playing so safe?,"I recently came across a group of guys online building hardwares like keyboards; beautifully designed ones. Transparent bodies that show the internal wiring, custom keycaps, artistic builds using different materials. It wasn’t about mass production or getting rich, it was about passion. They were just playing with the craft, exploring it.

And it made me think about software, which is my space. You look outside Kenya and you see people building amazing tools:

Perplexity AI — just using open AI models and a bit of code to rethink how we search the web.

Arc and Zen Browsers — basically Chrome and Firefox underneath, but reimagined with a fresh, thoughtful design.

Fellow devs know Supabase, Planetscale, Neon DB — not revolutionary ideas, but polished tools built on existing open-source databases that solve real developer problems in elegant ways.


Over here, we mostly get another delivery app, another finance app, another ""AI girlfriend."" Even in fashion, it’s the same formula, slap a logo or quote on a blank tee and sell it as a brand. Everyone's chasing virality and “quick money,” but very few are building with care, with vision.

And it’s not just tech or fashion. In real estate, almost every property is either a high-rise apartment or a huge mansion. Nothing in between. No townhouses, no duplexes, no creative use of small spaces. Interiors are the same grey tiles, same wardrobes, same white lighting. It’s like we copied one Pinterest board and called it a day. There’s no personality in most of what we build anymore.

But I get it. People are in survival mode. Graduates want stability first. Manufacturing is hard. Logistics are unreliable. Funding is scarce. And the saddest part is that we don’t have a strong consumer culture that appreciates thoughtful, original work. So when someone actually tries to do something different, they’re often ignored, underpaid or burnt out.

This has a ripple effect. Music starts sounding the same. Apps solve the same problems. Homes all look alike. Fashion feels soulless.
And slowly, we lose our sense of wonder and our ability to imagine and build something just because it feels meaningful.

Maybe this post won’t fix anything. But maybe it resonates with someone. Because I know I’m not the only one who wants more. More soul. More play. More risk. More weird, beautiful ideas and more of the kind that make you feel something.

Kenya,terminated projects,The Bare Minimum SGR Experience,"As a frequent user of the SGR, it’s hard not to feel like the experience is just at best, bare minimum. The stations are massive, impressive in design, yet strangely underutilized. The parking lots of both NBO and MSA terminals are just chaotic .No WiFi in the lounges —why is WiFi still a mystery in 2025?

Booking online is efficient, but strangely limited. You can’t choose your seat or coach—why? In a world where airlines and buses let you select your seat, this sgr feels wierd. And the fact that you still have to print your ticket at the station? What kind of 1950s backwardness is this? The ticket printing process is a sludge of slow lines and often malfunctioning machines. Why force human contact when none is needed?

To make it worse, there’s no SGR ticket office in town, forcing most travelers to take a long trip just to sort out some ticket issues. And then there is the bare minimum First Class. For 4,500 shillings,I expected more. No refreshments,no WiFi —just fewer humans in a coach.

I could go on and on. But like many projects in Kenya, the SGR had so much promise, and it’s frustrating to see it settling into mediocrity instead of aiming for excellence.

Kenya,SoCha,"""Wapi mtoto?""","It was always an escape for me during holidays ile wakati ya kuendea maziwa, most of you won't understand obviously. 

Our dad had this small library for us, na huko tulikua tunatoka tu wakati wa kuoga, kukula, na kuendea maziwa, because we had housemaid and farm boy.

So matime ilikua imefika ya kuendea maziwa, three kilometers away, juu ile ng'ombe yetu ya maziwa ilikua imepigwa baller, ikaamua maziwa haitoki. 

So it was just feeding, depositing ammonia and sleeping. Haijui vile ilinisaidia kutoka jela kidogo, ile furaha nilikua nayo, I would supply to five depressed guys na wasahau shida zao walai.

So we went with my bro, had time to chat juu library hakukua na kupiga story, laugh and enjoy the freedom.

At around 8p.m ndio tulikua tunarudi nyumbani, so we got to the kitchen placed the milk kwa meza and left, but before tutoke kitchen, there he was, very mean face at the door staring us.

Mi ni kama niliona tiger kwa mlango hio siku.

He looked scary akijam, so we hesitated to get to the kitchen's door.

""Wapi mtoto?"" He roared.

""Mtoto mgani?"" I responded.

If only we could have the ability to time travel and I had to change something, mimi ningechange hio part, nifyate ulimi.

That's how I borrowed 10kgs of a blow, ngumi ilinituma kwa mchanga tukabanja na mchwa dakika moja pale.

""Umemuumiza baba Colin."" My mother tried to defend me, lakini when it came to this prison wardener, kichapo haikua na conditions, hata sauti ya mpenzi haingesaidia.

My bro disappeared from the kitchen kama sungura, sijaijua huyo morio alipita aje mzae,  but he was not in the kitchen when I got up.

I was surprised which baby this mzee was asking, then I heard mom, ""Mbona mlienda na Ferdy kuchukua maziwa na ni mtoto bado, hata hakua na sweater.""

I swear to God I didn't know that son of troubles, kijana ambaye anatumia mguu kufikiria followed us.

Hata sikua nimejibu mom, nyaunyo ilikua ishanilamba mgongo, I walked like a kangaroo mpaka nje, mgongo ilikua imepinda kama bakora ya kukaa, lakini mguu haikutaka kusikia hivyo tena.

Now we were having a conversation kama niko 100 metres away, ""Mi sijui Ferdy ako wapi?"" Kiburi ilikua imepanda.

""Muende mtafte mtoto ama msirudi hapa."" He screamed.

Sisi na bro were clueless, 'saa tatu ya usiku jamani kwani sisi si watoto pia?' I thought.

""Tusipopata huyu mjukuu ya wazee wasumbufu mi naenda kitale kutafta job."" I furiously suggested.

""Hatuna ID."" Ndio ule kijana mwoga akanijibu.

""We unataka kufa ama kuishi?"" I asked him.

Before he responded, a bright flash light was directed to our faces. How you know the countryside norm, by saa tatu watu wamelala, and no lights outside, giza totoro.

We were scared but didn't care, because we had no home if we don't find that stubborn kid.

""Colin."" I heard the neighbor calling.

""Mnatafta huyu."" He continued.

Mimi sikutaka kujua neighbor ni mzae ako na family, before I even said a word, nilikua nishapakulia huyo msumbufu kijibare hapo, akatoka mbio mpaka nyumbani.

""Asante."" We told him and followed that cheeky boy home.

Mzee alikua hapo nje kwa uwanja with mom, and the mischievous kid.

""Kujeni hapa!"" He roared.

""Lala chini!"" He commanded. 

Mischievous kid alikua side yake, he was given one whip, aiyaya yaya yaaa, it seemed hurting, juu he woke up na kukalee around the big house mara tatu as he grabbed his sitting apparatus.

Mimi nilikua numb walai, couldn't even move, ni ka nilikua nimesniff bangi ndoo mzima.

My bro was the next, moja, kijana alipiga nduru ni kama mtu anaenda jehanamu, and then ladies and gents it was my time.

Ile methali ya cha mwenzako kikinyolewa chako tia maji, waliambia wale wako na time ya kutia maji, I had no time. 

Nilipachikwa uchungu nanii, mimi sikuzunguka nyumba, nilipata muscle pool. 

'Eeei jamani, kwani sisi tulikuwa watoto wa nani?' I thought.

""Kuja umalizie yako Ferdy, alafu nyinyi mmebaki na mbili ndio msirudie hio mchezo."" Mzae claimed.

'Nimebaki na mbili?' I was thinking of just escaping and never come back.

Wewe ndugu yako ashaikuweka kwa mess?

Kenya,SoCha,Is this a general erosion in culture? Or is it just moral decay?,"Firstly, Happy mother's day to all the mums holding it down for their babies/families. I personally see *you.* I am rooting for you in everything you are setting out to do for the remainder of the year. *Cheers!*

It has come to my attention that there's a serious erosion in ""culture"" or maybe its just morals in this case, in the treatment women/mothers are accorded. I mean when I was younger, mothers were held in some sort of reverence. **They were respected.** 

Now? All I see is aggressive undertones in how children, women, and mothers are viewed especially by men. It's really no surprise that femicide is on the rise(*If you didn't sign the petition  to criminalize femicide, I hope you do so today*). 

The general lack of empathy towards women is especially blatant in how single mums are regarded. I mean the contempt, the anger, the hate towards single mums is palpable. Its sad that the parent who stays is now regarded as stupid, for that. There's actually a steady rise in the number of women choosing to leave their children behind at the end of a relationship, their well being be damned. I attribute it to this online hate.

Let's not even talk about the lack of empathy towards children. As a mum, I'm so scared for my baby. It seems like the worst time in history to procreate.

Now, you as a single, childless woman is wondering, ""What's this got to do with me?"". Oh, YOU should be very concerned about this. While single mums are easy targets for this hate, you are not exempt. 

*Cha mwenzako kikinyolewa, chako kitilie maji.*

I love it for you that you are not part of the single mum demographic, and I hope it stays that way. If you're sexually active, better lock in with your contraceptive right now. DO NOT LEAVE IT UP TO THE MAN! 

But don't be deceived. This aggressiveness? It is towards all women. Young, old, thin, fat, tall, short, heck, even an infant is lumped here.

Kenya,SoCha,My Cuzo has been sued.,"So Cuzo yangu got served at the beginning of this  week by  one of those money lending companies. The guy saa hizi ako stressed hajui cha kufanya. He came to me asking on how he should handle this whole situation Kwa sababu hataki kwenda jela lakini the only thing I can do is to assure him that 2800 haiwezi kufanya ufungwe.

Kenya,SoCha,He carries everyone.....but who carries him?,"I know someone....kind, selfless, responsible, caring and everything you can call it, It hurts.  The kind of person who’d rather stay hungry than watch anyone else lack. A true mtu wa watu.  But sometimes I wonder, who is there for him? He care about everyone....who cares about him?

After his mum passed on, his dad decided to remarry. Which is fine, Everyone deserves happiness. But instead of handling his own plans, the man sat down, made a phone call and was like,  ""Naonelea nioe tena, but i don't have money for dowry, please help raise that for me."" Just like that. No shame! No budget! No plan! No ""are you in a good place financially? Nothing!!! And now he gotta feed both the dad and his new wife, i hope kids will have mercy on him and not add to the number🥱

Then comes the younger brother. No job, No income, No nothing, just vibes...decides arusi ni lazima. Marries. Hata haogopi jamani...   Before we even digest the wedding, mtoto wa kwanza is here.  Then baby number two, Wakaona...hapana he doesn't have enough responsibilities they brought in baby number three.  

Why? Big bro sends money every month. Like rent, utadhani umfanya kazi ya maana apewe mshahara, the family ATM! A walking Mpesa code!!!! Ati mtegemea cha nduguye hufanyaje??

I once told him, “Jaribu and don’t send anything this month, wacha tuone vile watasurvive.”  He looked at me like I’d said something evil.  ""Unafanya mchezo na maisha ya watu."" Me! Mchezo?  .... but no one ever worries about his life, do they?

One time we were just talking... quietly like he wasn’t even talking to me anymore.  ""I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ll never live in a nice house, or drive a cool car, or have much for myself. I’ve accepted that. I have responsibilities. Everyone depends on me. And that’s just how my life is, this Is my fate.” I just nodded, but my eye betrayed me and my cheek carried the evidence.

And I sat there. Speechless! Because this man, with a heart big enough to carry a whole village, doesn't know what it feels like to be carried.. ..We all got such parasites in our community and it's shameful, people ain't even trying, milking others is a kind of art they have mastered.

And it’s not just his dad. Or his brother. There are so many more...even when he’s the one with the emptiest hands it's always non of their business.

I look at him and wonder...If he ever became unavailable… would anyone survive? Or would they simply move on and find the next person to drain? Cause, let’s be honest….   Sometimes being dependable just makes you the easiest one to forget.

Kenya,SoCha,Hehehehe the day I ran away,"Story time

When I was in high school it reached a point where I felt the beating from my mother is too much and I was actually not that naughty but my mom used to beat us vibaya sana,so I decided after closing school am gonna run away 🤣🤣🤣 this was my plan,I didn't tell anyone that was a meeting I had in my head

So when we closed on the weekend I told my mom am heading to tao just to visit a friend and she was like ok ata she gave me fare and I didn't carry any clothes so it doesn't look suspicious,mimi huyo until tao then took another mathree to my grandma's house that was my escape plan 🤣🤣🤣 my shosho's place is not far from tao so I reached, that time was kitambo my grandma was still working and those days we used landline phones

So evening came grandma reached found me,we chat for abit told her ""I came here to umwind kidogo but I haven't said home inshort nimetoroka hehehehe""she was like it's ok and I was happy coz before when we were really young she wasn't that accommodating,so for that period of like one month I was there at grandma's place there no stress and I was with my other cuzos and my aunty, all that time I was there my mom didn't call so I knew she was not looking for me 😞 plus that time her and her mother(My grandma) were not in talking terms so my grandma didn't call also to say anything

When my mom is angry everyone keeps off even her mom coz weeh my mom goes crazy mpaka kutumia vulgar language so people just keep off to let her cool down,so after the one month and school was going to open I had to go home because of school I had no choice I knew I had to face the music,I knew what was waiting for me 😭 ""kichapo cha ""umbwa"" so I left my grandma's house,let me tell u Maina that was the longest journey ever,finally I got home as soon as I entered the gate my heart was beating so fast like it was about to come out of my chest

Then I went to enter the house coz we used to live the door open she was seated at the couch and the eyes she gave me I knew I am finished,I had a ka paper bag with some clothes I was bought for by my shosh,we had a house maid she was told to go get the mwiko weh let me tell u nilichapwa nikachapwa nikachapwa,I cried 😭 but wapi she used to beat us until she gets tired that's when she will stop until ur body is swollen,weh I was really beaten yaani hadi she climbs ontop of me and then she used to take a knife ""anakuwekea kwa shingo anakuambia unataka ni kuuwe""🤦🏾 aki unastuka finally it was over 

She was thinking in her mind I went to a man's house/boyfriend's place (but I did not have a boyfriend nor did I even know about s*x that time I was naive not even kissing I just had crushes and nothing more progressed,so when I told her I went to grandma's place she didn't believe me at all yet she didn't call my grandma(her mother)coz of her ego,so finally Monday I went to school and thought it's over but it wasn't even close to over kumbe they thought I was pregnant coz I had added abit of weight nkt 

This adding of weight happened all the time I went to grandma's place coz I used to say the food there is delicious so I used to eat more than my portion and my mom knows that but still didn't believe me and she doesn't want to confirm with my grandma(her mom)coz of her ego,so after afew days when I was in my night dress (it used to be a big t-shirt) which was loose, my father called me before I went to sleep and he was like can u spread ur arms,I did that then turn around I did that then he was like go so I just went didn't think anything of it

Then after few days same same it happened like 2 or 3 times then stopped when I finally asked my mom to give me money to buy pads I guess she told him (my dad)and they were like ""phew"" they knew all is good, remember I still have no idea what's going on at all

So years later when am an adult my mom starts talking about that story and she was like do u remember that day u were being told to turn around it was bcoz ur Father thought u were pregnant imagine 😞 I felt so bad really hurt coz I was at my grandma's place all they had to do was ask my grandma just a phone call away but no then Mom was saying it was my Dad but it was both of them.she was also relieved when I got my period plus my mom has a tendency ya kuruka mtu we are used to that by now she rukad my Dad and it was both of them who were doubting me then said it was my dad even, the day we were Chased away from home (in my earlier post) after few months later she started regretting 

Then she started telling people it was my Dad who chased us away and  she was not involved 🤦🏾 yet they chased us both together

People have medical reasons as to why they don't consume certain things and I happen to have a taste and texture issue.

Kenya,ABT,Spreading some light on the fertilizer situation,"Ok so we have probably heard of some high profile ppl talk abt the fertilizer “scandal” I put it in quotes cause most of it is pure misinformation. 

Before i start with what I know, I’d like to comment how I know it first…. I am 23(m) quite junior in all things politics and agriculture however my dad was/is a “high profile “ individual who is part of the directors in one of these agricultural departments (keeping it a vague as possible)… that probably answers how I know some of these things 

What I know…. Russia donated fertilizer about, 35,000 tonnes (that’s a lot… thx Russia ) my dad was a part of these departments that tried to repurpose these into more… so smart ppl reformulated it into 100,000 tonnes (thanks smart ppl ) 

Controversy spurs by some individuals saying these fertilizer were given then resold to the govt… this in particular is a lie, the reformulation was handled by public offices with private assistance obv things like storage and processing was outsourced but held publicly… 

Kenya consumes abt 800k tonnes of fertilizer yearly and 35k was donated… but the subsidy was around 70% in 2022 it was abt 40% so Russian donations + govt intervention directly caused the price of fertilizer to reduce.. ofc they are inefficiencies and mis appropriation i think 10-15% of the fertilizer was stolen by more senior persons but it wasn’t an all out quack show..

Ask me questions, let’s see if I can answer some

Kenya,ABT,I am starting to get the meaning of love from a female P.O.V(or not 😆),"Epiphany?? I don't know but I finally realised that my perspective of love is so different from women's. Yeah I understand that it should be common sense but yoooh! This people are amazing men. Like dude! They have a different perspective and its so fucking exciting!!!!!!!! 🤪
So get this, I am not the guy who believes like ""oh we are rushing things"" ""we should take it slowly"" I believe that if we kissed that night it happened at the right moment..(Consensually Of course 🙂) So I used to not feel like guilty abt something we both enjoyed doing. Like I am sorry if nitakaa fala but all in all I do tell most of the people I get intimate with that I am like that and if they're not comfortable with it, its fine we'll go our separate ways or I'll find a way to ""behave"" myself. Ikishindikana ndacommunicate abt what I am feeling and if you're okay with it I'll make it worthwhile. Anyway enough abt me, I've come to realise that (maybe wrong🫢) Women prefer to take things slowly because of the luxury of overthinking about every single thing about you. Especially if the like you (eyyyy maiiilod🥹).....
see I always had the courtesy of talking things out with someone b4 being intimate and success rate has been amazing.. but yeah I always encounter the statement ""I think we are moving too fast"" .. somehow my response to that statement always worked and we ended up sharing a moment or getting intimate. Okay see 👀 lemme get back to what I was saying.
I think women like fantasizing about you more because the thrill and dopamine rush is so fucking good. Like that time that you tried to kiss her and she shyed away is because you hit her with sth ""unexpected"" and she wasn't  prepared and it felt good but she didn't want to do it first because she was scared of how you might have reacted...
Yo!yo!yo!yo! That is fucking amazing.
Do you guys understand the mental thrill in such a scenario 😅 that's amazing. I'm  always a go getter and I usually put my mind into something and do my best to get it and if I dont I just let go and leave. I do communicate everything and I am honest abt me.(learnt never to do this the hard way😂)
Slippery slope is all I can say!😆 but you get it? I'll be straightforward from the moment I smell like yeah lemme just say it out loud... but eyyy baba! Unaona after ameshy away from hio kiss take your time b4 doing it again uone venye itamamnice mbaya na wewe kwanza ndo utapigwa kimunju...😅 mtu wangu huwanga fiti mzee 😜. Unajua in between your first failed attempt and the second one that girl will spend so much time fantasising about it again and again and again and each time ataplay scenarios za it going so fucking well and thinking of how they want you to make them feel about it and atleast a scenario where it goes terribly bad and you either stop and discover sth bad about her (they do care about appearance my guy🤫) and you either run away or I don't  know we elewa tu kuna venye!!!! Donge🫴
 So the longer this takes the longer you make her crave for it and to prepare for it in all the best ways possible. Mtu wangu utatayarishiwa 😅 so take your time and don't even bring it up again and just know that ukiendelea kumbamba utapewa Kiss heheheheh eyyyy!!! 
They like the thrill it comes with.. Don't rush things my guys...Take your time and every single moment you get with her utaenjoy....usijichoche ati venye we ni bazu huwa unaperform everywhere you go and you get everything the first days..hio kitu itakuwa short lived mtu wangu  na wewe ndo utaumia roho lakini utajifanya uko sawa juu hamkuwa mnadate hata 😅 ukiwa in it for the long run... take your time uone.😄
Juu unaona her fantasizing about it gives her feelings of joy, happiness and anafeel to visexy yaani anafeel appreciated so that turns her on alot and mkiwa pamoja utaona akicheza na nywele ama akikuguza guza randomly. She'll also maybe have a wet dream about you. SO boss take your time, make her crave for it.. mtese kidogo avoid physical touches kiasi and try and not stare at her lips just short hugs and quick goodbyes. Hahahaha she'll overthink that thing msee. SO  the longer you take the sexier it gets for both of you.Alafu kwanza kuna kale ka negative thought kamoja ka either akudisappoint ama umdisappoint na atahave kukudiscard as early as possible ama we uchoree story zake inaletanga a clash of sth called hot and sweet......wolololoyaye sasaaa 😅
Mtu wangu patience ni mzuri.. especially if works in both of your favor.......you'll feel like umeaccomplish such an amazing feat.I guess the same concept  applies in all aspects of life.

Wah!! Mwenye anakuja next ataenjoy 😆😆😆

There’s always that sellout that ruins the very thing we’re trying to solve. And if we can’t sit down to question and understand the gravity of the problem then I only see more sellouts than I can count

Just today in school we were discussing about corruption and the Lec asked one question, would you guys accept bribes even if it went against what you stand for?

Most of the class said yes!

So it’s not really the fact that there are bad leaders or corruption. It’s just a bunch of sellout mentality engraved in our minds

Can’t we just pause the sellout mentality for even 10 years to give prosperity a chance to flourish??

Now for one, Mimi I don't intentionally keep up with news. I get it from Tiktok and X. 

It's been a couple of hours of back to back news and here are things I didn't know.

1. There hasn't been a budget for vaccines for newborns. What??? What the actual fuck!? Thinking about how BCG needs to be administered like within the earlier weeks of life, what do you actually mean hakuna vaccines? And the ones who can't afford private hospitals, how will those babies live?

2. There is no budget for national exams. That one I knew but kitu sikujua, these morons (apologies, or not,  if you're part of the team) are launching a new system KEMIS to consolidate all education systems and learners and professionals, idk man do the research. And guess what, the system exists ni vile inaitwa NEMIS. Sounds familiar, huh? (SHIF/NHIF)

3. I won't even touch on the Sugar Mills, the budget cuts for  the education and health sectors, the state house budgets, the new MP salary increase. Yho nishukisheni.

4. There was an idiot on Citizen news this morning defending the presidency saying 200k jobs have been created. Where? And going abroad for work isn't it. Must I go to another country to get greener pastures? Why can't we empower our own people to build here? 

Liiiiiikeee all I see is damage that will take years to undo.

Eg Jana I was on the expressway and thinking, this structure will start earning Kenyans money in the 2050s, wtf!! 

This is definitely betrayal in the city juu kama we're living in Mstahiki Meya.

Anyways, may the force be with you all. Happy Friday ☺️

Kenya,supply chain USAID,China Square Is Minting Billions: Here’s How You Can Too,"China Square has become a retail giant almost overnight. From a single store to over five branches in less than five years, they’ve built a booming business selling everything from kitchenware and stationery to home furniture.

What’s their secret?

It's not flashy marketing. It's not celebrity endorsements. It's something far simpler and anyone can do it.

They mastered product sourcing.

Here’s how they did it and how you can copy their exact playbook.

1. They Source Smart, Direct from China

Almost every product on China Square’s shelves is imported from China. Only a few items come from third-party vendors.

Want to know why that matters?

Let me show you.

During a visit, I spotted a basic ceramic mug on their shelf priced at KSH 250. Out of curiosity, I searched for the same product on Alibaba and found it listed for just KSH 40.

That’s a 525% markup.

I checked a few more items, storage boxes, office supplies, even furniture accessories, and the pattern was clear:

China Square buys low and sells high, while still offering competitive prices compared to local suppliers.

2. Volume Is the Game

By importing in bulk from manufacturers on Alibaba, China Square keeps their costs extremely low. That gives them the power to dominate pricing in the market and scale fast.

Lower sourcing costs mean higher profit margins, which fuel business expansion.

3. You Can Do It Too

The beauty of this model is that it’s not exclusive to big corporations. Whether you run a small store, sell online, or dream of opening your own retail chain, you can start sourcing from China today.

Look for suppliers on Alibaba, negotiate lower pricing, ship bulk and sell locally.",1749370656.0,2025-06-08 08:17:36,31,32,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l674ig/china_square_is_minting_billions_heres_how_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l674ig/china_square_is_minting_billions_heres_how_you/

Kenya,supply chain USAID,Tatties,"I come from a region where potatoes **could** do better. Planted some shangi last year, after getting duped by UrbanFresh(that the seeds were markies variety!). I am prejudiced against shangi. So I prefer Dutch Robjn.  The prob is Dutch Robijn sells out fast on NPCKVIAZISOKO.COM, unlike other varieties like sherekea, markies, unica. 



Just seen that there's a new variety of potatoes called Challenger. Any farmers trialed it out? Word on the ground is that its susceptible to blight which is another headache I don't want to deal with.



Unrealibility of certified seeds is a major hindrance. Then add the fact that seeds sold in most parts are bacterial wilt infested. Which leads to poor yield and infested soils.


Questions for the potato farmers:


1. Where do you usually source your seeds from?


2. How do you deal with blight(late, early)?


3. How much does your yield fetch?


4. On the supply chain, how far are you from the consumer?


5. Which seasons do you prefer?

Kenya,community resilience USAID,What’s Happening to the Kenyan Youth? A Reflection on Violence and Rejection!,"Another tragic story unfolds—a young girl’s life cut short, her body reportedly hidden in a water tank above a hostel. The suspected perpetrator? Her boyfriend. This heartbreaking incident raises urgent questions about the state of our youth today.

What is happening to our young men and women? Is rejection so unbearable that it drives some to commit such heinous acts? As Gen Z navigates a world of social media pressures, economic challenges, and shifting cultural norms, are we failing to equip them with the tools to handle rejection, disappointment, and conflict?

Statistics paint a concerning picture. In Kenya, youth unemployment stands at a staggering 35%, compared to the national average of 10%. Substance abuse and mental health issues are also on the rise, with leaders urging communities to address these challenges. Additionally, 75% of Kenya’s population is under 35, meaning the youth are not just the future—they are the present.

We’ve all faced rejection in our lives, yet we moved on. Why does it seem harder for today’s youth? Is it the lack of mentorship, the erosion of traditional values, or the overwhelming influence of digital culture?

Let’s discuss: How can we better support our youth to navigate life’s challenges without resorting to violence? What role should families, schools, and communities play in fostering resilience and emotional intelligence?",1743770112.0,2025-04-04 12:35:12,4,18,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jrasik/whats_happening_to_the_kenyan_youth_a_reflection/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jrasik/whats_happening_to_the_kenyan_youth_a_reflection/

Kenya,Africa Water Facility,Gen M.Langley (US Africom head),"I listened to him on Dr. Kingori’s podcast, and for all the flak he’s been catching over his remarks on Ibrahim Traoré, I found him to be one of the very few especially among Westerners who actually grasp the security dynamics in Africa, particularly in the Sahel.

There’s a widespread habit  among both Western analysts and even many Africans  of projecting the Middle Eastern framework of jihadism onto African jihadist groups. But that comparison often misses the mark. The jihadist groups in the Sahel aren’t simply bands of men radicalized by fiery imams, all obsessed with building a caliphate. That’s not how it started.

Back in the early 2000s, at the height of the War on Terror, the Sahara was relatively safe. Mali even hosted the 2002 AFCON, and the Dakar Rally used to pass right through the desert. Today, that entire region is crawling with terrorists and criminal networks. So, what changed? Where did they come from?

The truth is, many African governments have never had the capacity to fully control their territory. In those neglected regions, armed tribal or clan-based militias naturally spring up, much like the bandit groups we see in Kenya’s North Rift and Northeastern regions. These militias have long existed in the Sahel. In fact, Gaddafi often hired them to fill out his Libyan army.

Now, it’s worth remembering: most of these Sahelian communities are Muslim. They’ve practiced Islam for generations,but not the fundamentalist kind. So what you had were armed Muslim militias, not radical jihadis. That changed after Gaddafi was overthrown. The chaos in Libya opened the floodgates, and a mix of shady characters started flowing south through the Sahara, just as people have done for centuries. Among them were ultra-conservative, militant clerics preaching a violent brand of Islam. And when they arrived in the Sahel, they hit the jackpot.

Here were militias of young, armed Muslim men, stuck in regions crippled by state neglect, drought, and desperation — the perfect recruits. All they needed was a little push. These clerics gave them one. Instead of fighting over water, grazing land, or goats, they were now fighting for “something greater”: the will of God. And just like that, the militias evolved slowly but surely into full-blown jihadist groups.

A great case study of this transformation is the relationship between the MNLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad) and jihadist groups like Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). At first, they were allies. They ousted the Malian state from the north and declared the independent Tuareg state of Azawad. But it didn’t last. The MNLA was secular; AQIM and Ansar Dine were Islamists. Tensions grew, especially when the jihadists started imposing Sharia law. The MNLA was having none of it. The alliance crumbled, and today, they’re bitter rivals. I remember hearing a young MNLA leader saying: yes, they were Muslim, but they never intended to create an Islamic state.

So when I listened to Gen. Langley on that podcast and heard him talk about the layers in this conflict, it was refreshing. He actually understood the nuance. That’s rare.",1748782036.0,2025-06-01 12:47:16,0,10,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0o4t7/gen_mlangley_us_africom_head/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0o4t7/gen_mlangley_us_africom_head/

Kenya,Africa Water Facility,Is it time to come to countenance that grass isn’t greener on the other side but where you choose to water it?," 

The Kenyan government has been lying to its citizens, that it is making plans to secure them jobs abroad. When in reality exporting slaves in airplanes, not on the once dingy ships. Not on farms but on construction sites. Not to feudal masters but home masters as housemaids.

The world, with uttermost honesty, is grappling with a shift in order. The people abroad are confused, countries have no job opportunities to offer its citizens. The UK prime minister recently declared a fight against unlawful immigrants, and the need to tighten its doors on job opportunities to undocumented immigrants and students.

Canada, a once upon land of abundance, the autumn leaves no longer bring peace, rather a potential resource for embers, embers of pain.

There has been a serious immigration into Kenya and Africa by people abroad. Many of our ‘majuu’ uncles and aunts, are coming back to Kenya, to a fresh start.

The USA declared a fight on immigrants. Americans in cities are moving to upcountry!

Then here I am with the American dream. Maybe it is time to wake up, at least I can have a check of the reality, lest I pee on self, if I keep dreaming.

Dreaming of greener grasses, when the grass on both sides is dry; sufficient to light embers to warm the aching cold heart, engulfed with regret and confusions.

Kenya,Africa Water Facility,"792,694: a national crisis?","TW: life.
This is an appeal to apologists, philosophers, counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and anyone who can dedicate some mental bandwidth to wade the murky waters of this issue. There were 792,694 abortions in Kenya in 2023. Key highlights from the Daily Nation story on 3/5/2025:

• 66% were not using method of family planning when they became pregnant. 

• 78.6% of post abortion care patients were married or living with a partner and young (age 25-34, 41.8%)

• 6/10 married and educated women who previously had babies account for the highest induced abortion rates. 

• 37% of those who sought post abortion care had secondary level education and 91% identify as Christians

• 89.4% preferred medication as one method 

• 82% only had one lifetime abortion 


• Key reasons include being unprepared for parenthood and the high cost of raising a child.
 
This high number is something we need to reflect deeply upon because it has profound implications for the future of Kenya. The very fabric of society means that these are dreams and potential gone. It's deeper than the pro life/choice debate because after the online shock, mockery, polarization, and jokes about it, real families are living in the aftermath of this reality. Pro-choice could mean carrying a pregnancy to term, and pro-life could mean exploring adoption before delivery. 
  
There are several angles to pick from the story; this article will narrow down to the state of the Kenyan family. 
  
Let's therefore ponder:
1. How can church communities improve awareness and education about contraception without shame and stigma? 
2. What does it mean to be prepared for parenthood? 
3. How can the costs of raising a child come down? 
4. What policies can improve the quality of education and healthcare while subsidizing costs long term? 
5. Are CBC & SHA in their current state increasing the financial strain on families? 
6. How will local church communities partner with grassroots health facilities to offer preventive or post care for rape survivors?
7. If infidelity is a contributing factor to these cases, how can we review genuine relationship satisfaction and longevity?
8. Could normalizing adoption in social conversation or dating change this situation?
9. How do harsh work environments or indirect career penalties contribute to this crisis?
10. The role of abuse: be it emotional, mental, physical, financial or spiritual in breaking trust in relationships or marriages to compounding this. 
11. Does post abortion care include counseling and appropriate preventive measures?
12. Where are safe spaces for such conversations to go on? 

If we fail to approach this with compassion and safety, shame and fear could make it unimaginably worse. We can't afford to wait for external intervention. We need to be the ones extending safety, understanding and compassion where we are to make a difference. 

Edit: this is in no way written to shame or condemn those who have had an abortion. If anything, this post is an invitation to have social introspection about what could be done better.

Kenya,Africa Water Facility,Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Sometimes, it’s good to understand the nuances too.",1745563462.0,2025-04-25 06:44:22,5,17,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/
Kenya,Africa Water Facility,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,Africa Water Facility,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,3,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/

In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Sometimes, it’s good to understand the nuances too.",1745563462.0,2025-04-25 06:44:22,6,17,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7egoz/vietnam_gas_ceo/

Kenya,elections grant USAID,Separating modern political struggle from commercial activism.,"TLDR: Wewe soma kama unajiskia.

First, sijalipwa na mtu. I am expressing my thoughts based on my observations over the last year. Anyway, I just watched the BBC documentary and the fact that the commercial activists are the faces of J25 doesn't sit well with me. I still maintain that J25 was not organic to a great extent. Money exchanged hands and a lot of it. As much as the finance bill protest was meant for Kenyans to collectively push against punitive taxes, an unseen hand funded and pulled the strings. The finance bill was the perfect opportunity for this person or group of people to strike. I also don't think that this person or group of people had the interests of Kenyans at heart. The way those protests started and fizzled out is an indicator.

I know this is an echo chamber, same as KOX but I am not going to hold back. I was skeptical of commercial activists from the word go. If you guys can recall the first day of the protests, these guys casually gave themselves up to the police. It was like a photo op. Casually following the cops, extending their hands to grab the rope that hangs from the back of the lorry and hoisting themselves inside. These guys were even smiling inside there, no chants, just banter as other Kenyans were running and getting teargassed. Their body language was so telling. I voiced that on X. Of course I got bashed, for asking that question I was called a misogynist as if Boniface Mwangi is a woman or a trans guy.

You guys, do not think for once that these activists stand for the same values as you. Remember Boniface Mwangi was supporting Raila, even after this con man revealed his cabinet of criminals and drug dealers like this cocaine guy from Mombasa, Joho? He stood with the same side that was funded by Uhuru Kenyatta, a looter, land grabber, and economic assassin. Which values was he standing for exactly? I believe these guys kina Boni, Hanifa, Njeri, Shakira, and most of the people who were captured in those awe-inspiring patriotic moments were paid. It was not a coincidence. Also note that they used a lot of women, psychological tacts to use misogyny as a defense when people start raising questions.

I want to remind you that these people do not share the struggle with ordinary Kenyans. These guys are well-funded, they have money. If things went south, they would be granted asylum in some of the most developed countries in a heartbeat. They probably always have their passports ready and an exit plan. It is ordinary Kenyans who were killed and injured during those protests, these activists were not even in the frontlines. I laugh when I see people propose that some of these people deserve political seats because they are activists. This is the same system of using political seats as gifts we are up against yet people want to perpetuate it. Tf is wrong with Kenyans?

What I'm saying is we need to separate our struggle from these activists. They can join us in agitating but don't think they are in it because they are so patriotic. If it wasn't for the money, how sure are you they would be doing it? They don't deserve political seats because they are activists. Mohamed Ali was an investigative journalist but after getting elected he sided with the oppressor, same with John Kiarie, a political satirist. We need a second wave of agitating for change but we must decenter the movement from commercial activists. Their moves, intentions, and sources of funding can easily be used to discredit an otherwise innocent and genuine struggle for change.",1745820876.0,2025-04-28 06:14:36,9,9,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k9orkn/separating_modern_political_struggle_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k9orkn/separating_modern_political_struggle_from/

InternationalDev,Kenya AND USAID,Are any of you in Peru or do work with the Peruvian Amazon?,"I’m a recreational travel blogger and I’m in the middle of writing a post about my trip to the Amazon. I stopped at this manatee and wildlife rehab center (in Iquitos) and saw that it was supported by USAID. On the off chance one of you knows about this project or can find out background about it, that would be helpful. I should’ve asked before I left, but didn’t think about it until I started writing. 

I am not an ‘influencer,’ and this (blogging/writing) is not a money-making venture. (I’m a college mathematics professor during the school year.) But I do have a very modest following (just under 10k), and in the past I’ve been able to rally support to the tune of $3k-$5k USD for various causes (laptops and cell phones for guides in Kenya, an orphanage in Uganda, educational supplies for a village in the Philippines). 

I’m hoping that with any insider knowledge you might have, I’ll be able to tell a compelling story and 1) force people into calling their reps/senators, 2) help donate to this specific cause. 

The closure and illegal dismantling of USAID has hit me hard. I cannot think about, write about, or talk about it without breaking down in tears. In particular, knowing the children of sub-Saharan Africa are dying of starvation fucking *haunts* me. I’m trying to do what I can to get more eyes on the eradication of such a vital part of the US government’s outreach. 

This program in specific is Centro de Rescate Amazónico / Amazon Rescue Center in Iquitos, Peru. I’m attaching a pic of the sign I saw. (Please keep in mind that I only speak a tiny bit of Spanish, unfortunately.)

Thank you for your help!
