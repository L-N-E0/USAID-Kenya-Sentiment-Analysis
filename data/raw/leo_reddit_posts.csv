People might say the wazungu just go to and showcase the bad areas but fail to question why we have those dilapidated areas. Accountability from our leaders in these areas is so lacking while ukienda huko unaoneshwa mansions za governors, mps, and former chancellors or whatever they were before the new constitution.  A youtuber does more for a community than what the administration does with funding, taxes, and loans. Make it make sense.

Kenya,foreign aid,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,foreign aid,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,3,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/
Kenya,foreign aid,Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",1743469962.0,2025-04-01 01:12:42,120,124,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Kenya,foreign funding,Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2. Methodology from https://dsbb.imf.org/e-gdds/dqaf-base/country/KEN/category/NAG00. **FYI** You can calculate GDP via 3 approaches - **Income**(sources of funds), **Expenditure**(uses of funds) & **Output**(production of goods/services). To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Kenya,foreign funding,Be very cautious of the UAE,"Kasongo has been cozying up to the UAE recently and as Kenyans we should be very careful here, if you look at their foreign policy they a pattern of fostering chaos and undermining democracy and legitimate governments.

- In Sudan they fund and support the RSF ,in fact there are reports that they are the ones who pushed the RSF into launching the war.
- In Somalia they support the breakaway region of Somaliland.
- In Libya they fund and support the warlord, Khalifa Haftar.
- In Egypt they orchestrated a coup to overthrow Morsy, the only democratically elected leader in Egypt.

I don't know but who's to say that they will not try and help Kasongo in subverting the 2027 elections? After all they wouldn't wanna lose their logistics hub.  As the Swahili say 'Ukiona cha mwenzako kinanyolewa ,chako tia maji' and btw all those countries you see above all thought it couldn't happen to them.",1748512311.0,2025-05-29 09:51:51,32,13,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ky6sma/be_very_cautious_of_the_uae/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ky6sma/be_very_cautious_of_the_uae/
Kenya,foreign funding,"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”  

Edit:To the trolls: Save your Bible verses. This is about Kenyan lives.

Kenya,foreign funding,"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

•	When (and where) do you expect to retire?

Also, given our income levels, extended family responsibilities, and economic challenges, do you think FIRE is realistic in the Kenyan context?

Kenya,foreign funding,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,foreign funding,"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

* Rift Valley delivered 78% of votes to Ruto in 2022. This base isn't eroding.
* Mt. Kenya may complain but historically votes for the incumbent (see Kibaki's 2007 re-election despite discontent).

**5. Our Neighbors Are Progressing While We Obsess Over Politics**

* Tanzania attracted **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank), while Uganda's **oil project** is projected to generate **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank). Furthermore, Uganda's **oil project** is expected to generate **2 billion** annually, starting in **2025** (Uganda Ministry of Energy).

Meanwhile, Kenya attracted just **$1.2 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the same period (CBK 2023 Report).

As of now, we're already in **2027 campaign mode.**

* Gen Z isn't getting IDs (only 1.2M new registrations in 2023 vs 6M eligible)
* Middle-class Kenyans will tweet but won't vote (42% turnout in urban areas)
* The poor will vote - and they'll vote for whoever meets their immediate needs

Like it or not, #TanoTena is coming. The numbers don't lie.

Kenya,foreign funding,Kenyan lawyers please help - scammed,"Long story short me and a Kenyan colleague were both in China during covid and he helped me move my money out of China through Kenya. Some of it was sent to my home account, but then he claimed his funds were frozen. Since then he has returned home and has been claiming to be in court with his bank. I for one cannot find any ruling or cause that matches his name or the nature of the dispute on the Kenya Law website, he claims he went to court through a third party and says it wasnt published. He only gave me the judges name.

My question is whether I have any real way to get the money out of him whilst being abroad. I dont think a foreign white guy would have any business showing up and making claims. The only strange thing is that he still replies to my messages as if he intends to give it bsck eventually.

Kenya,foreign funding,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",1744053003.0,2025-04-07 19:10:03,3,3,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/
