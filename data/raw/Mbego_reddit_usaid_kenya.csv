Need Advice,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijthoh/need_advice/,2025-02-07 12:05:39,Kenya,"Hello. Ok, so, I finished High school last year (KCSE) and I need advice on which course I should apply for. I'd say I'm pretty flexible but I'm mainly debating between two courses, Medicine and Surgery vs. Dental Surgery.

I've spoken to different professionals in both fields and all have different things to say. I'd like to weigh demand and working conditions for each of them and how this is expected to change in, say, 7 years, around when I'll graduate. Also, I've seen that there are a lot of unemployed doctors despite there being an apparent demand in the health sector.

Those who are already in the field or are studying at the moment, what would you say about this? And which of the two is likely to be in higher demand in 7 years. Lay people as well, what are the expected trends in the health sector in future (factoring in USAID and everythingüòó).

Also, would it be better to commute from home or to live closer to school in hostels or students residencies, especially for demanding fields. Anyone can answer this, I appreciate any help. I'm also considering Pharmacy and Nursing (BSN).

THANKYOU‚ù§Ô∏è

P.S: Any related advice which I have not exactly asked for here is still very welcome 

Edit: Note that I also intend to specialize, regardless of the field. "
USAID woes,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijyka5/usaid_woes/,2025-02-07 16:10:26,Kenya,"many people don't know how USAID made many Kenyans rich and enabled some to manage a better life(financially and health-wise) lakini saii it's visible 

Almost 500k Kenyans(households) are set to lose their source of livelihood, diseases are about to spike in Africa which could've been prevented via vaccination which was funded by USAID lakini Trump ni nani

Although I don't advocate dependency as a country this one will however have a serious effect on Kenya and Africa as a whole considering corruption crisis as whole

Lakini someone said if our president can renovate the state house with billions then he also has the ability to fund the most important program ""Children Vaccination Program"" sio tu kuleta mapastor wazungu huku.

The Rise of AI-Generated Fake Experts in Health & Nutrition in Kenya,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1imviaz/the_rise_of_aigenerated_fake_experts_in_health/,2025-02-11 10:22:47,Kenya,"In the recent past i have noticed that it‚Äôs impossible to scroll through social media without being bombarded by so-called nutrition and health ""experts"" spewing the same AI-generated advice. ""Seed oils are poison!"", ""Beans are actually carbs, not protein!"", ""Sugar is the root of all evil!"". Of course some of these are true and backed by science but its sickening to have it repackaged for engagement with those doing the repackaging positioning themselves as experts or talking about these things like they are new discoveries.

Most of these ""experts"" wouldn‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre talking about without ChatGPT spoon-feeding them their content. AI has made it incredibly easy to regurgitate information without understanding it. And now, we have an entire economy of influencers charging for things like meal plans; literally just AI-generated templates with fancy branding with Kenyans falling for them.

Many of these pseudo experts don‚Äôt even follow their own advice. They‚Äôll tell you to cook with coconut oil, but step into their kitchen, and you‚Äôll probably find a bottle of Golden Fry sitting right there. The inconsistencies are endless.

The danger in all of this? AI is great at summarizing existing knowledge, but it doesn‚Äôt replace real expertise. Yet, millions are blindly following these pseudo-gurus who have no real background in nutrition, no ability to critically analyze studies, and no accountability when their advice leads to misinformation or harm.

AI should be a tool, not a crutch. But for many, it‚Äôs become their entire personality. And that‚Äôs a serious problem."

Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis. ,6,https://i.redd.it/33vo7suznfzc1.png,2024-05-09 17:09:56,Kenya,"**Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis**
More than 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.

There were early warnings (https://meteo.go.ke/forecast/seasonal-forecast) that Kenya‚Äôs long rain season ‚Äì between March and May ‚Äì was going to bring above-normal rainfall. The extreme intensity of the rain has resulted in devastating floods in many parts of the country. Forty of the country‚Äôs 47 counties have been affected. More than (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.
Poor maintenance of key infrastructure and drainage systems, and disregard of environmental regulations regarding maintenance of land near rivers, contributed to the situation.
The government has responded with measures to minimise destruction and
safeguard lives. These include ordering the evacuation of households living close to dams (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/3/kenya-floods-10) and water reservoirs (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/86-families-ordered-to-move-out-of-ruiru-village-in-kijabe/) in 33 counties, and forced evictions (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/nairobi/article/2001494577/residents-living-on-riparian-land-cry-foul-over-forceful-eviction) of those living near rivers. President William Ruto has also announced welfare support for displaced households (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/president-ruto-announces-sh10000-stipend-for-displaced-households/).
The effects of the flooding will have a massive impact on Kenya‚Äôs economy. I‚Äôm a development economist (https://www.tegemeo.org/images/_tegemeo_institute/staff_profiles/dr_timothy_njagi_profile.pdf) with 20 years of experience in the field of development planning, policy implementation and research. I‚Äôve also worked with the National Treasury and Economic Planning (https://www.treasury.go.ke/).
I‚Äôm particularly concerned about these things: damage done to transport infrastructure, which will affect the prices for goods and services; destruction of crops, which will affect food security; and business losses, which will affect household incomes and consumer purchasing power.
The cost of repairing what‚Äôs brokenwill also have a major impact on the country‚Äôs budget, which is already stretched.

**The impacts**
**Infrastructure destroyed**
A great deal of infrastructure has been affected.
Besides roads, some dams, airports and water infrastructure will require maintenance.
Floods and a landslide on the railway route between the capital Nairobi and Mombasa forced Kenya Railways (https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kenyas-rail-operator-says-floods-144935922.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACdZl4Lw9kOCOkT1iZzN_G4G9VakYCev6Y4ZLhJnnheiU51RSzkRTGQbFGHnxunqEmRejJyEKQVc1JtQ-1KByCGTEkjIkqPfLBkEqD0i6ICfnAC8nYqMaMxUTk-XSRTXsyMVFJqFYKii-Q2DyJkAdHKmkNZ4zrfhkVbZB19c3_ii) to close all cargo services. Nairobi satellite commuter train services were also suspended (https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-05-02-kenya-railways-suspends-nairobi-passenger-train-services/).
Currently, 58 roads have been reported (https://www.redcross.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8-05-2024_-_MAM.pdf) destroyed. Some of these roads (https://www.k24tv.co.ke/news/floods-render-major-roads-impassable-138210/) are key highways, such as the Kapenguria-Lokichar-Lodwar highway, Nakuru-Eldoret road and Oletepesi-Magadi road. The Nakuru-Eldoret road also connects Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
The road disruptions will immediately raise the cost of transport as goods will go via longer routes. This will have an effect on businesses in the transport, wholesale and retail sectors.
The rains have also affected service infrastructure ‚Äì like water pipelines (https://eastleighvoice.co.ke/city-affairsnews/39520/city-hall-repairs-3-main-water-pipelines-damaged-by-floods) in Nairobi ‚Äì and filled dams to capacity. In one tragic incident, a dam in Kijabe burst its banks (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/29/dozens-of-people-dead-in-kenya-floods), flooding villages and killing at least 40 people in the Mai Mahiu area.
The destruction of infrastructure will have a major economic impact. Assessments from the last major flooding (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746) in 2018 show that the government had to allocate an extra US$120 million (24% of the budget in the previous year) for repairs and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The repairs weren‚Äôt immediate and sometimes weren‚Äôt carried out at all (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746). The effects were felt for years (https://nation.africa/kenya/news/cost-of-flooding-to-be-felt-for-years-reports-show-48494).
**Cropland destroyed**

Kenya‚Äôs agriculture sector has also been hit hard. Agriculture is vital to the economy, accounting for (https://www.usaid.gov/kenya/agriculture-food-and-water-security) about 33% of the country‚Äôs GDP and employing 40% of the total workforce. It‚Äôs a critical source of livelihood and income for millions of Kenyans.
About 40,000 acres (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) (16,187 hectares) of cropland has already been reported to have been destroyed (https://www.citizen.digital/news/ahero-rice-farmers-count-loses-as-floods-wash-off-plantations-n341619). In the 2018 floods, it was estimated that about 21,000 (https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/hunger-looms-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-east-africa) acres of crops were destroyed and that was a threat to food security. The impact of the floods on Kenya‚Äôs agriculture was substantial, with estimates suggesting billions of Kenyan shillings (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/hunger-looms-as-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-in-east-africa-1393560) in crop damage and lost production. Additionally, the floods
triggered landslides and soil erosion.
This time, twice as much land is affected. Farmers in affected areas face a total crop failure, their entire livelihoods washed away. The flooding of 2,000 acres of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001494684/food-crisis-looms-as-farmers-warn-of-total-crop-failure?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=may2024), for instance, is likely to result in losses to the tune of KSh60 million (about US$445,000) in lost crop. This doesn‚Äôt include the loss to businesses that would have used the crop.
So far, the basket regions ‚Äì where most of the staple food production takes place ‚Äì have been spared the worst of the flooding. However, there is a very high likelihood of perishable crops such as vegetables and pulses recording very low yields. They have shorter maturity and may have been waterlogged or swept away.
The effect on food security will likely be felt much longer. Though Kenya has yet to estimate the effect of the flooding on food production, in Tanzania ‚Äì which exports food to Kenya ‚Äì there are estimates that the floods will cause a 30% decline in production this year (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/ea-braces-for-hunger-as-floods-destroy-farms-4612440). Food prices will likely stay high.
**Cost to the purse**
Kenya‚Äôs economy is still recovering from shocks that include high debt distress, global food inflation and exchange rate shock.
The budget estimates (https://www.treasury.go.ke/budget-books-1/) for the next financial year reveal that the government has a delicate balancing act in trying to meet commitments as well as stimulating key sectors of the economy.
To cater for emergency response to the flooding situation, the government has forwarded a supplementary budget of Ksh11 billion (about US$80 million) (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/government-seeks-mps-nod-on-sh10-6bn-to-combat-floods--4613976) to the National Assembly for approval. This will likely all be spent to provide direct support to households, resettle displaced
households and reconstruct infrastructure such as schools and health facilities.
The government is already struggling to meet revenue targets (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kra-in-tough-race-to-collect-sh1-1-trillion-in-four-months--4562510#google_vignette) due to a slowdown in economic performance. The total reconstruction will cost much more, and will divert resources from other sectors.
**Better preparation**
Overall, the current flooding will have long-term effects on the economy. The turnaround depends on the choices that policymakers make. A balance has to be maintained between reconstruction efforts and support to productive sectors of the economy, while offering support to those that have been affected.
There is a need to learn from the current disaster to prepare better for the next climate shock.
First, the disaster response of county
governments must be strengthened. For instance, storm water drainage ‚Äì blamed for much of the flooding in urban areas ‚Äì is a county government function.
Second, there is a need for better coordination between government and non-state actors to ensure more efficient use of resources to support affected households.
Third, with climate shocks becoming more frequent, there is a need to invest in better weather prediction and early warning systems. Then there must be immediate action on the recommendations from these systems, including training for households in areas prone to disasters.
Fourth, better planning in urban settlements is needed. This includes proper maintenance of roads, bridges and drainage infrastructure, adherence to building codes and standards and environmental regulations ‚Äì such as protection of riparian lands.
Finally, investing in generating and creating access to data can help to inform responses and improve planning for reconstruction after disasters.
