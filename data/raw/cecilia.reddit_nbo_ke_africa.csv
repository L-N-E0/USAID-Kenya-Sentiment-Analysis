Kenya,donors,Dear Gentle Readers,"Good morning my gentle readers

Today I have a question to this men, why are you so tied up with your friends that you prioritise them over your families ama it's just baba without manners? 

Anyway Reason number 4 on why I will never forgive baba without manners: his unhealthy attachment with his boys. 

This particular friends have been a thorn in my life and I just blame baba without manners (I will save his number like this😂😂). 
Anyway let me take you back to the end of my second trimester heading to the third, that's when we moved in together.  

How do you people house hunt when searching for a house that utaishi na spouse wako? Si mnaenda pamoja ama? And weigh the options right? 

Aaah, baba with funds went with his friends looking for a house that we are supposed to live in. I tell him, na si uende na mimi juu unaenda kuishi na mimi😐😐. It fell on deaf ears. Anyway, he goes with them looking through different houses and the only thing I get is videos and reasons why he doesn't wanna live in the area. 

He finds the house we are currently living in, and kwanza it is on the 5th floor and this building has no lift. By then I was very heavily pregnant and such a distance would have been a great inconvenience. Anyway, baba without manners commits all of that and just sends the video. I see it's a nice house and tells me, ameshalipia. 

By then, I had moved out of my sweet house🤣🤣the house i was very happy in and experienced so much growth. Aaah, baba without manners wewe🙄🙄🙄. So, he moves everything in and comes for my clothes. And tells me, he will come pick me up kesho yake. True to his word, he did come lakini hio heaviness kwa roho yangu jamani. And shockingly, nilipanda stairs mpaka fifth floor and I was out of my breath. 

But moving into that house became a thorn into my life, each weekend baba without manners forces me to go home because he wants to host his friends. At first I get mad, and walk out naenda home. One weekend I refused to go home, I told him, kwani nyi wanaume wote wasita hamuezi kakomboa air bnb mkae huko🙄🙄

Gentle readers, ni kama niliguza nyuki, he started ranting, he said venye, I do Everything for you, na we kunipea tu privacy kwa nyumba yangu ata huezi. Enda kwenu nitakukujia tuende kanisa on sunday🫥. Mimi nikasema siendi, Aaah, aliongea matope wadau hata skuamini. He left, akaenda shugli zake and came back the following day mchana claiming ametoka ulevi hata sikuuliza. 

I asked him one day, si hata unipeleke just kwa park nikaone wanyama basi. ( nikiwa mdogo sijai enda hizo school trips because apparently my shosho didn't see the need to pay for me to go see wild animals). He told me he will ask his friends they plan for it. Aaah, curse those men, walikataa wakasema huko wameenda mara mingi. Anyway, the only place baba with manners takes mi ni kanisa na kwao na kwetu sometimes. Smh. 

Nothing can be done juu lazima hio committee iamue mambo ya kwangu. Anyway, one of his friends has a wife that decided she wants to be happy. Now, they all call her a hoe just because hangojei bwana yake to do things with her. Baba without manners is now projecting that on me. He says venye akiwai nipata nikikunywa tutakosana vibaya sana. 😂😂😂. 

Now, that is really affecting my freedom, juu, lets say I go even to town, aaah baba without manners will keep calling me after every 20 minutes aniambie niende home. Kwanza saa hii with our baby is worse. He will tell me, rudi home uangalie mtoto as if I do not know that. 

Let's go to today's incident. Nimemwambia I will leave for an hour or two, my mum is coming to town na anahitaji my help. Eeei gentle readers, ashaanza kuniuliza for how long nakaa huko. I told him mimi sijui, si he left akaenda. Now as we speak, alishapiga simu kuniambia venye whatever i am going to do in town sio important at all. I should be very fast and go back home juu hio sio emergency. 

For  context, my mum kuna siku amehitaji blood donors and baba without manners did not he gave a flimsy excuse. I couldn't donate because I am breastfeeding and pia I gave birth through CS so singekubalishwa. My mum alikua admitted close to 3 weeks and hakuai bother kuenda hata kumuona and she asked for him. He said atamuonea nyumbani, two months later he has never even asked kama ako sawa. 
Aaah, baba without manners ananichukia mimi na familia yangu yote🤣🤣🤣. 
Kwanza now that i am dependent on him, he is enjoying every bit of my misery. Hata akinituma supper, of which money is calculated so he will inspect kama nimenunua what he says, he will keep calling me to make sure I am back kwa nyumba by 6pm. Claiming hataki giza inipate nje, but surely, ulinipata nikiishi pekee yangu😅😅😅 hio supper ata saa tatu ya usiku nlikua naendea. 

So men, what the hell do you rely on yiur mbogis for? 

Till later gentle readers, 
Have a fantastic day as you grind. ",2025-05-30,60,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/
Kenya,USAID,USAID Repercussions + Economy,"My neighbour’s wife was a very big shot in USAID and has now lost her job. Children have been removed from big private school. Husband is a big guy at PWC. Lifestyle changes are occurring rapidly as her income has vanished. Thousands of her USAID coworkers were sent home with no salaries. 

USAID Vendors, contractors, non-profits that received funding from them have all been left in a lurch. Sasa machozi zimeanza. 

Next is empty apartments around “high class” areas.

UN is laying people off left right and center.

Additionally, public assistance programs in the Europe and America are being slashed so remittances by a certain sector are falling.

If you think things are hard, ngojeni mpaka December. A lot of your highlife hotspots are about to close. A lot of these restaurants are about to close. 

Crime shall return so please rudini mashambani mulime.

Avoid Mombasa, Lamu and malls.

Kenya,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Foreign aid/Philanthropy,"I see the aid or philanthropic activities that are done by youtubers and can't help but wonder what has the government done in our 60 years of self governance. People might say the wazungu just go to and showcase the bad areas but fail to question why we have those dilapidated areas. Accountability from our leaders in these areas is so lacking while ukienda huko unaoneshwa mansions za governors, mps, and former chancellors or whatever they were before the new constitution.  A youtuber does more for a community than what the administration does with funding, taxes, and loans. Make it make sense. Anyway, i appreciate all the efforts beast philanthropy, JerryRigEverything, among others are doing.

Kenya,USAID,Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business.",2025-04-07,168,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/

Kenya,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",2025-04-01,120,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Kenya,"USAID, USAID money",Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

Kenya,USAID,The Israel-Gaza War: A Symptom of a Looming Global Showdown,"At first glance, BRICS, the rise of the AfD, Trump, USAID, China, the Russo-Ukraine war, and the surge of right-wing politics in Europe seem unrelated to the conflict in Israel. However, they are all pieces of a larger geopolitical struggle—one that signals a growing divide between the Global North and the rising Global South.

For decades, Western powers dominated global affairs, leveraging economic sanctions, military interventions, and financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to maintain control. But this order is being challenged. The first major warning came with the Russia-Ukraine war. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions, expecting Russia’s economy to collapse. Instead, Russia pivoted to the Global South, deepening trade ties with China, India, and other BRICS nations. Not only did Russia’s economy remain stable, but it also continued producing advanced weaponry without Western technology—something previously thought impossible.

Then came October 7, 2023. Israel, the West’s key ally in the Middle East, was attacked in an unprecedented assault that exposed severe weaknesses in its security apparatus. Israel’s much-vaunted military—long perceived as invincible—was caught off guard and humiliated. This was a serious blow, not just to Israel but to Western hegemony itself. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 had already shattered the myth of Western military invulnerability. The Russian invasion of Ukraine further demonstrated that Western deterrence was weakening. If Israel—a nuclear-armed state backed by the U.S.—could be so easily struck, what message would that send to the rest of the world?

Western powers needed to respond forcefully, not just to defend Israel, but to reassert their dominance. Their message is clear: We will arm Israel no matter what. We will support them regardless of civilian casualties. And we will broadcast the destruction of Gaza for all to see—so you understand that resistance is futile.

This is not just about Israel or Palestine. It’s about power. The Global North is watching as the Global South—led by China and supported by Russia—grows economically and demographically. BRICS is expanding, challenging the U.S.-led financial order. Right-wing populism is surging in Europe as economic strains push Western nations inward. The U.S. is increasingly relying on military-industrial alliances and foreign interventions to maintain its grip on global affairs.

The Israel-Gaza conflict is a symptom of this broader struggle. It is a power play—a brutal display meant to reinforce the notion that, despite its decline, the Western order will not relinquish control without a fight. But the cracks are showing, and history suggests that no empire, no matter how dominant, can hold back change forever",2025-02-26,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/

Kenya,"USAID, NGOs","Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

Lakini someone said if our president can renovate the state house with billions then he also has the ability to fund the most important program ""Children Vaccination Program"" sio tu kuleta mapastor wazungu huku. 

either way the effects itaonekana before hii mwaka iishe

but real talk, Has there ever been a good US president?... who's just human for human?",2025-02-07,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijyka5/usaid_woes/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijyka5/usaid_woes/
Kenya,USAID,Need Advice,"Hello. Ok, so, I finished High school last year (KCSE) and I need advice on which course I should apply for. I'd say I'm pretty flexible but I'm mainly debating between two courses, Medicine and Surgery vs. Dental Surgery.

I've spoken to different professionals in both fields and all have different things to say. I'd like to weigh demand and working conditions for each of them and how this is expected to change in, say, 7 years, around when I'll graduate. Also, I've seen that there are a lot of unemployed doctors despite there being an apparent demand in the health sector.

Those who are already in the field or are studying at the moment, what would you say about this? And which of the two is likely to be in higher demand in 7 years. Lay people as well, what are the expected trends in the health sector in future (factoring in USAID and everything😗).

Also, would it be better to commute from home or to live closer to school in hostels or students residencies, especially for demanding fields. Anyone can answer this, I appreciate any help. I'm also considering Pharmacy and Nursing (BSN).

THANKYOU❤️

P.S: Any related advice which I have not exactly asked for here is still very welcome 

Edit: Note that I also intend to specialize, regardless of the field. ",2025-02-07,8,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijthoh/need_advice/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijthoh/need_advice/

Nairobi,USAID,Theres always someone out there worse off than you.,"I was talking to my South Sudanese friend yesterday,when he asked me if there were any job opportunities I could refer him to.He said that he's been unemployed since the massive turnoff of USAID jobs.

I'm like why cant he look for another job. He told me that getting a job in Kenya,you first need to process a work permit and that's 20k and plus he used to work in Class D,so that's 500k extra.He was like he couldn't afford that. So I told him to begin at home-like what about his home country.

And he said that was even worse. Unless you're a Dinka in South Sudan you're ot getting a job(think of them like Kikuyus in Kenya).He said that even scholarships aren't spared,the best scholarships go to the Dinkas.I thought that he was a tribalist until I later on saw that it was [true.Now](http://true.Now) in South Sudan,they aren't like in Kenya,In Kenya,companies are actually obliged to employ kenyans first before foreigners.I think a guy mentioned it in the sub a few hours ago...

In South Sudan, it's actually the opposite-they actually employ people who aren't South Sudanese-like if you're a Ugandan,youre more likely to get a job opportunity there and so on...(again other than if you're a Dinka).I mean this guys are corrupt(but not more corrupt than KASONGO,lol)

And on top of that South Sudan's employment rate is 12,49 compared to Kenya's at 5.7%.They also have-and this actually shocked me.Wueeh only 5.1% of people there have access to electricity.And also south Sudan has the least literacy rates in the WORLD at 34.52%.

I know Kasongo aliharibu hii nchi lakini damn,not to be respectful,you cant pay me enough money to live in South Sudan(no disrespect to South Sudanese-I actually love yall).

Any South Sudanese in this sub,is any of this true?",2025-05-12,81,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1kl7bcm/theres_always_someone_out_there_worse_off_than_you/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1kl7bcm/theres_always_someone_out_there_worse_off_than_you/
Nairobi,aid withdrawal,What steps are you taking to keep your business profitable.,"Let's face it, since last year August; a lot of businesses have been struggling to stay afloat in Kenya coupled with Trump's aid withdrawal which i am sure is affecting many NGO's. What are you doing to keep your business profitable?",2025-04-14,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jyv2tj/what_steps_are_you_taking_to_keep_your_business/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jyv2tj/what_steps_are_you_taking_to_keep_your_business/
Nairobi,"USAID, USAID money, donors, NGOs",My experience with the USAID Money.,"The list of companies who've been getting money from USAID is out and looking at it, I'm questioning whether we needed USAID in the first place. Sometimes back, a childhood friend who runs an NGO at the Coast called me that he'd be attending a USAID Conference at a location in Nairobi's Blue zone. The following day (Monday), I passed by the hotel to say hi at around Lunch hour. To gain access, I had to write my name and a few details at the entrance of the conference facility. Later that day i received around $130 from USAID. I continued receiving different amounts from USAID every evening until Friday that week. In total, I think I received around $600. I called him on Friday evening, told him of the amounts I had been receiving from the conference. He asked me to take half and send him half but I told him I'll just take one fuel tank $190 and send him the rest, which I did.
 
This experience reminded me of two stories. 
1. A lady that I highly respect (she's in this sub and has experience with grants and fundraising) once told me about the NGO world and that the main objective of most of the NGO's in Kenya is to swindle donor funds. I didn't take her seriously but now looking at the list of the organizations that have been collecting millions from USAID, with minimal to zero impact, I now agree with her. She was right. 

2. I once had a fling who was a CEC-M in one of the counties in Kenya. She used to be passionate about the need for NGO regulation and holding NGO's accountable for every penny they receive from donors to ensure that such funds are properly utilized to impact the targeted population. I didn't take her seriously and thought that maybe as a government official in her county, she just jealous that she had no cut in NGOs money. She was however speaking from a point of knowledge - Her mother, an NGO director was out earning her father who was an accomplished Professor and a researcher (Do you know how much you need to make to outearn a reputable researcher?)- Looking at the USAID list, now she's making sense to me than ever. 

Note:
1. I sympathize with the thousands of families who are going to be affected by the loss of livelihoods from USAID's exit.. 
2. I also sympathize with the millions of families whose unfortunate flights are used by NGO's to secure funding only for such funds to be redirected to the Director's private exploits. 
3. I advocate for working systems where all entities can be held accountable and more do where the Government can be diligent and efficient to an extent where we achieve self reliance and therefore don't rely on donor funds in the first place.

Nairobi,USAID,Karibu na mzuri! A day in the life of a job seeker.,"Karibu na mzuri! A day in the life of a job seeker.

Sijui  niite bahati ama kuponea chupu chupu. Nimeitiwa hustle flani nikiwa hapo CBD , nayo mimi afisa mtiifu wa Generali Shillingi ya Kenya nikareport post . post ilikua hapo kamukunji.  I was given a days contract as clerk wa kudistribute  ""jst arrived"" USAID relief food , in my mind I was like this is God , I arrived in town that morning for an interview ya izi mboka za gulf .Anyways kijana nimepiga m&s zangu  za pale T2 safi , navy blue pants n a white shirt, chini  nimefunga hesabu na dark brown boots , Clarks flani I scored gikomba na bei ya Sunday (btw Sunday bei NI ya -wananchi-) .

Alright post pleasantries tume exchange na mama Mikey, ( shes the one who called me in )  nikaonyeshwa desk na mine forms pale tayari , lakini si mnajua Tu mambo ya hii serikali msongo, relief food kwa TV walishapiga picha za exchange handshake, lakini kwa ground Lori ya mikate ndo imefika pekee sasa NI tutegee Lori ya unga na mafuta iko hapo' Uhuru highway'.  

20mins wait ishageuka 3 hrs , ata wenye walikua wamekujia hio aid ikabidi warudi home na hustle kidogo afu wakam mabadae, Mimi nilitoka kwetu malaa 5:30 morning ndo nimake interview ya 8:00 anniversary towers, so pale kwa desk ya mine nishaanza kudrool , si fault yangu men, Kiti ilikua billionaire barn mesh , very comfortable thing ,miguu pale juu ya acquisition form za wenyewe,nikua Nishaanza kuota vile sasa hao clients na investors WA Kai and Karo wamehamia sasa kwa kampuni ya mine long story short niliamshwa na sauti ya glass wall ikimwagika, lakini vile hio sauti ilikua karibu I dared not open my eyes Mimi NI mgonjwa wa macho am keen to protect my eyes more than am eager to see whats happening.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Nairobi,USAID,The USAID effect,"The whole USAID issue has dealt a big blow to the middle class in Kenya, a majority of who do not bother with whatever happens in local news and much less, about elections. This will hit hard at almost every sector of the Kenyan economy. Coupled with the deportation issue, inflows to Kenya are going to significantly reduce plus the real estate sector, entertainment industry, health sector and a large segment of businesses in the private sector. I however believe, that this will significantly impact the influence of the US across the world and will now pave the way for other superpowers to take over especially China and Russia. This is just my perspective though? What adverse effects do y'all believe will be felt here in Kenya?",2025-02-05,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1iifq41/the_usaid_effect/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1iifq41/the_usaid_effect/

Sasa I am scrolling on social media and see that trump signed to pull the US out of the W.H.O.
 I am wondering how this will affect the African continent especially Kenya.
With Ruto in office and his SHA that is barely working,without the USAID what will be impacted most in our healthcare systems from drugs to equipment etc.
I don't know much this Topic  but I just feel like this move will have a negative impact kwanza with this current government",2025-01-21,8,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1i6t4ur/trump/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1i6t4ur/trump/
