The end of USAID means Kenyan's losing their jobs,196,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ii4bja/the_end_of_usaid_means_kenyans_losing_their_jobs/,2025-02-05 06:57:44,Kenya,"There is probably a whole industry of local Kenyan workers in NGOs and other organizations that were benefiting from US dollars in the form of USAID funding and other organizations. People who were getting Ksh400k salaries and much better than that for doing much less work than their neighbours. Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents. Its become impossible for normal hustlers to find a decent place to live near Nairobi.

I wonder what happens to these people, can they find a job somewhere else?

Also Trump has not finished, there will be more cuts, more funds and organizations that are shut down. I wonder how much the Kenyan economy was getting out of the inefficiency and extravagance of US spending??"

Children have been removed from big private school. Husband is a big guy at PWC. Lifestyle changes are occurring rapidly as her income has vanished. Thousands of her USAID coworkers were sent home with no salaries. 

USAID Vendors, contractors, non-profits that received funding from them have all been left in a lurch. Sasa machozi zimeanza. 

Next is empty apartments around “high class” areas.

UN is laying people off left right and center.

Additionally, public assistance programs in the Europe and America are being slashed so remittances by a certain sector are falling.

USAID and Self reliance,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ii3qam/usaid_and_self_reliance/,2025-02-05 06:17:32,Kenya,"USAID has been scrapped and a section of Kenyans and Africans are largely celebrating the move claiming it will lead to self reliance and all that,which to be clear is a good thing, a lofty Ideal.

But I can't help but notice something those making those tik toks and tweets are mainly urban, middle class folks, you know the kind of people who probably don't rely on USAID for survival. Now since we can't build capacity to manufacture vaccines and ARVs immediately even if we wanted to and don't get me started on changing our leadership, fighting corruption and all that...none of that can happen immediately, it may take years ,perhaps even decades. My question to them is ,How many infants are you willing to see die of measles, malnutrition, polio etc in your quest for self reliance? Is it 1? 10? 100? 1000? 10,000? 100,000? How many lives are worth sacrificing for self reliance?

Now if you haven't been about the country, it may be easy to read some article in a newspaper or a tweet claiming that this professor or that think tank did a research that found aid doesn't reach their intended target and take it as gospel truth ,you may even retweet some retards' claims that the UN is useless,UNICEF is useless, WHO is useless and all that, but those of you who have been in distressed and conflict ridden areas know how absolutely crucial USAID and the UN are.

An example during the height of the last drought an estimated 4 mn Kenyans were at risk of starvation, now if you budget kes 150 for every individual per day i.e food ,distribution and administrative costs that's about 600 mn kes per day or 18bn per month. Inevitably someone will come and say but 'we lose 2bn to corruption everyday', 'we can grow our own food (completely ignoring the fact that areas that are hit hardest by famines are normally populated by nomadic pastoralists and telling them to grow their own food or practice zero grazing entails a huge lifestyle change which again takes time) and all those talking points they seem to have, but these are long term fixes but now we need a solution Now since people's lives are at risk."
"The USAID discourse, bad systems and miracle cases",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iiax61/the_usaid_discourse_bad_systems_and_miracle_cases/,2025-02-05 14:17:07,Kenya,"So there’s been a lot of talk about USAID halting operations, but that’s not what I’m here to discuss. What gets to me more is this tired, ridiculously simplistic idea of “Why \[*insert underprivileged group*\] can’t succeed.” We need to dismantle that mindset already, it’s long overdue.

I’ll use myself as an example. I \[21M\] grew up in Mukuru after we had to leave Wilson when our old mabati shack got condemned. Like so many kids around me, I was born into a system that was set up against us from day one. My parents knew the only way out was education, so they did everything they could, sacrificing upto 70% of their income at times to keep me in an *okay* boarding school. That came at the cost of their own financial stability, but it worked. I got into one of the top national schools in the country.

Then life happened. Covid wiped out my parents’ income. Depression hit hard. We got evicted from a home we had lived in for 15+ years. University wasn’t even an option since we just couldn’t afford it. We were housed by my dad's friend and another friend gave me an old laptop. I taught myself programming, and two years later, I have a stable job. I’m earning decent (not crazy) money and a big chunk of it goes to my parents. For the first time in a long time, I can actually see a future.

But let’s be real about what this actually means. Compare me to the two types of friends I’ve had; the ones I grew up with in Mukuru and the ones I met since high school. A little over a year ago I attended the funeral of a childhood friend who was stabbed in a gang fight. Another is reforming after he watched a bunch of his friends murdered by police (These are the shocking stories I'm picking to show contrast, not most of them live this way). The other camp is traveling, starting businesses, just living with a kind of confidence that only comes when you know the ground beneath you is solid.

>Bad systems hide behind miracle cases

I am a miracle case and if you made it out, so are you. Not because we worked harder or were smarter. But because circumstances aligned for us in ways they just didn’t for others. Maybe it was a laptop, a connection, a school or just being in the right place at the right time. I see some of these “miracle cases” going around saying “No one helped me, I helped myself.” But really? Did you? Or did you, like me, just get enough of a break that someone else didn’t?

The idea that success is purely about individual effort is a lie. It’s a convenient story that ignores the fact that we live in a broken system where the odds are so stacked against most people that no matter how hard they try, they’ll never make it. Schools in informal settlements and rural areas are falling apart. I follow [this guy on tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@propesacomedy) who exposes the dilapidated state of public amenities, especially schools and hospitals, in counties like Bomet. The system is designed like a burning building with one emergency exit. The few who make it out alive aren’t proof that the fire isn’t deadly. They’re just proof that they found the door and that's why it needs to go.

Some people argue that the government isn’t responsible for solving societal problems. But let’s be real, governments set the legal, economic and policy framework that shapes everything. Their decisions on education, healthcare and infrastructure don’t just influence opportunities; they decide who even gets a shot. They’re literally tasked with addressing issues like poverty and inequality. So no, it’s not just about individual effort. It’s about fixing a system where most people never even get a real chance.

So if you made it out, don’t fool yourself into thinking it was just you. Recognize the system for what it is. And more importantly, understand that real change won’t come from telling people to “just work harder.” It’ll come from fixing the structures that make survival a miracle in the first place."
USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,2025-02-07 08:06:17,Kenya,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back."

Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,2025-04-07 04:21:12,Kenya,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business."
"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job",183,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iny5w8/finally_its_gets_deeper_i_lost_my_job/,2025-02-12 18:39:13,Kenya,"With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jjehwq/why_western_powers_back_israel_no_matter_what_and/,2025-03-25 08:18:04,Kenya,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

I'd say I'm pretty flexible but I'm mainly debating between two courses, Medicine and Surgery vs. Dental Surgery.

I've spoken to different professionals in both fields and all have different things to say. I'd like to weigh demand and working conditions for each of them and how this is expected to change in, say, 7 years, around when I'll graduate. Also, I've seen that there are a lot of unemployed doctors despite there being an apparent demand in the health sector.

Those who are already in the field or are studying at the moment, what would you say about this? And which of the two is likely to be in higher demand in 7 years. Lay people as well, what are the expected trends in the health sector in future (factoring in USAID and everything😗).

Also, would it be better to commute from home or to live closer to school in hostels or students residencies, especially for demanding fields. Anyone can answer this, I appreciate any help. I'm also considering Pharmacy and Nursing (BSN).

The Israel-Gaza War: A Symptom of a Looming Global Showdown,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/,2025-02-26 05:53:21,Kenya,"At first glance, BRICS, the rise of the AfD, Trump, USAID, China, the Russo-Ukraine war, and the surge of right-wing politics in Europe seem unrelated to the conflict in Israel. However, they are all pieces of a larger geopolitical struggle—one that signals a growing divide between the Global North and the rising Global South.

For decades, Western powers dominated global affairs, leveraging economic sanctions, military interventions, and financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to maintain control. But this order is being challenged. The first major warning came with the Russia-Ukraine war. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions, expecting Russia’s economy to collapse. Instead, Russia pivoted to the Global South, deepening trade ties with China, India, and other BRICS nations. Not only did Russia’s economy remain stable, but it also continued producing advanced weaponry without Western technology—something previously thought impossible.

Then came October 7, 2023. Israel, the West’s key ally in the Middle East, was attacked in an unprecedented assault that exposed severe weaknesses in its security apparatus. Israel’s much-vaunted military—long perceived as invincible—was caught off guard and humiliated. This was a serious blow, not just to Israel but to Western hegemony itself. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 had already shattered the myth of Western military invulnerability. The Russian invasion of Ukraine further demonstrated that Western deterrence was weakening. If Israel—a nuclear-armed state backed by the U.S.—could be so easily struck, what message would that send to the rest of the world?

Western powers needed to respond forcefully, not just to defend Israel, but to reassert their dominance. Their message is clear: We will arm Israel no matter what. We will support them regardless of civilian casualties. And we will broadcast the destruction of Gaza for all to see—so you understand that resistance is futile.

This is not just about Israel or Palestine. It’s about power. The Global North is watching as the Global South—led by China and supported by Russia—grows economically and demographically. BRICS is expanding, challenging the U.S.-led financial order. Right-wing populism is surging in Europe as economic strains push Western nations inward. The U.S. is increasingly relying on military-industrial alliances and foreign interventions to maintain its grip on global affairs.

The Israel-Gaza conflict is a symptom of this broader struggle. It is a power play—a brutal display meant to reinforce the notion that, despite its decline, the Western order will not relinquish control without a fight. But the cracks are showing, and history suggests that no empire, no matter how dominant, can hold back change forever"

The Rise of AI-Generated Fake Experts in Health & Nutrition in Kenya,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1imviaz/the_rise_of_aigenerated_fake_experts_in_health/,2025-02-11 10:22:47,Kenya,"In the recent past i have noticed that it’s impossible to scroll through social media without being bombarded by so-called nutrition and health ""experts"" spewing the same AI-generated advice. ""Seed oils are poison!"", ""Beans are actually carbs, not protein!"", ""Sugar is the root of all evil!"". Of course some of these are true and backed by science but its sickening to have it repackaged for engagement with those doing the repackaging positioning themselves as experts or talking about these things like they are new discoveries.

Most of these ""experts"" wouldn’t have a clue what they’re talking about without ChatGPT spoon-feeding them their content. AI has made it incredibly easy to regurgitate information without understanding it. And now, we have an entire economy of influencers charging for things like meal plans; literally just AI-generated templates with fancy branding with Kenyans falling for them.

Many of these pseudo experts don’t even follow their own advice. They’ll tell you to cook with coconut oil, but step into their kitchen, and you’ll probably find a bottle of Golden Fry sitting right there. The inconsistencies are endless.

The danger in all of this? AI is great at summarizing existing knowledge, but it doesn’t replace real expertise. Yet, millions are blindly following these pseudo-gurus who have no real background in nutrition, no ability to critically analyze studies, and no accountability when their advice leads to misinformation or harm.

AI should be a tool, not a crutch. But for many, it’s become their entire personality. And that’s a serious problem."
Ignorance or malice?,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1inj4k3/ignorance_or_malice/,2025-02-12 04:49:42,Kenya,"I have just watched the MP of Homa Bay defending Trump, saying the reason he does so is because of his stand on LQBTQ+ rights.

Trump is the same man who called African countries shithole countries, and is currently trying to end USAID. Correct me if I'm wrong, but does Homa Bay not have the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya. Shouldn't he want organizations like USAID to keep on working in healthcare, since they supply ARVs and other stuff for cheaper rates than if we went out there and bought them ourselves.

Most NGO's are funded through donor support. Your bosses may not tell you, but in the next 2-3 months, most of you will have to be let go (fired). You need to start making deliberate decisions to prepare for that eventuality. I know you are used to good salaries (200k - 500k) and you probably live in an apartment of 60k-120k. First things first..

1) Look for a cheaper rental house (20k max) that you can afford to pay without struggling.

2) Avoid taking any loans (cars, mortgage) cos this will exacerbate your situation incase you are fired

3) Start thinking of a business you can setup (be smart about it, businesses that target basic needs like food, clothing, shelter tend to do good)

4) Start praying that Trump will change his mind and that the donor support will not be halted."

Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis. ,5,https://i.redd.it/33vo7suznfzc1.png,2024-05-09 17:09:56,Kenya,"**Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis**
More than 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.

There were early warnings (https://meteo.go.ke/forecast/seasonal-forecast) that Kenya’s long rain season – between March and May – was going to bring above-normal rainfall. The extreme intensity of the rain has resulted in devastating floods in many parts of the country. Forty of the country’s 47 counties have been affected. More than (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.
Poor maintenance of key infrastructure and drainage systems, and disregard of environmental regulations regarding maintenance of land near rivers, contributed to the situation.
The government has responded with measures to minimise destruction and
safeguard lives. These include ordering the evacuation of households living close to dams (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/3/kenya-floods-10) and water reservoirs (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/86-families-ordered-to-move-out-of-ruiru-village-in-kijabe/) in 33 counties, and forced evictions (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/nairobi/article/2001494577/residents-living-on-riparian-land-cry-foul-over-forceful-eviction) of those living near rivers. President William Ruto has also announced welfare support for displaced households (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/president-ruto-announces-sh10000-stipend-for-displaced-households/).
The effects of the flooding will have a massive impact on Kenya’s economy. I’m a development economist (https://www.tegemeo.org/images/_tegemeo_institute/staff_profiles/dr_timothy_njagi_profile.pdf) with 20 years of experience in the field of development planning, policy implementation and research. I’ve also worked with the National Treasury and Economic Planning (https://www.treasury.go.ke/).
I’m particularly concerned about these things: damage done to transport infrastructure, which will affect the prices for goods and services; destruction of crops, which will affect food security; and business losses, which will affect household incomes and consumer purchasing power.
The cost of repairing what’s brokenwill also have a major impact on the country’s budget, which is already stretched.

**The impacts**
**Infrastructure destroyed**
A great deal of infrastructure has been affected.
Besides roads, some dams, airports and water infrastructure will require maintenance.
Floods and a landslide on the railway route between the capital Nairobi and Mombasa forced Kenya Railways (https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kenyas-rail-operator-says-floods-144935922.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACdZl4Lw9kOCOkT1iZzN_G4G9VakYCev6Y4ZLhJnnheiU51RSzkRTGQbFGHnxunqEmRejJyEKQVc1JtQ-1KByCGTEkjIkqPfLBkEqD0i6ICfnAC8nYqMaMxUTk-XSRTXsyMVFJqFYKii-Q2DyJkAdHKmkNZ4zrfhkVbZB19c3_ii) to close all cargo services. Nairobi satellite commuter train services were also suspended (https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-05-02-kenya-railways-suspends-nairobi-passenger-train-services/).
Currently, 58 roads have been reported (https://www.redcross.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8-05-2024_-_MAM.pdf) destroyed. Some of these roads (https://www.k24tv.co.ke/news/floods-render-major-roads-impassable-138210/) are key highways, such as the Kapenguria-Lokichar-Lodwar highway, Nakuru-Eldoret road and Oletepesi-Magadi road. The Nakuru-Eldoret road also connects Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
The road disruptions will immediately raise the cost of transport as goods will go via longer routes. This will have an effect on businesses in the transport, wholesale and retail sectors.
The rains have also affected service infrastructure – like water pipelines (https://eastleighvoice.co.ke/city-affairsnews/39520/city-hall-repairs-3-main-water-pipelines-damaged-by-floods) in Nairobi – and filled dams to capacity. In one tragic incident, a dam in Kijabe burst its banks (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/29/dozens-of-people-dead-in-kenya-floods), flooding villages and killing at least 40 people in the Mai Mahiu area.
The destruction of infrastructure will have a major economic impact. Assessments from the last major flooding (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746) in 2018 show that the government had to allocate an extra US$120 million (24% of the budget in the previous year) for repairs and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The repairs weren’t immediate and sometimes weren’t carried out at all (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746). The effects were felt for years (https://nation.africa/kenya/news/cost-of-flooding-to-be-felt-for-years-reports-show-48494).
**Cropland destroyed**

Kenya’s agriculture sector has also been hit hard. Agriculture is vital to the economy, accounting for (https://www.usaid.gov/kenya/agriculture-food-and-water-security) about 33% of the country’s GDP and employing 40% of the total workforce. It’s a critical source of livelihood and income for millions of Kenyans.
About 40,000 acres (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) (16,187 hectares) of cropland has already been reported to have been destroyed (https://www.citizen.digital/news/ahero-rice-farmers-count-loses-as-floods-wash-off-plantations-n341619). In the 2018 floods, it was estimated that about 21,000 (https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/hunger-looms-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-east-africa) acres of crops were destroyed and that was a threat to food security. The impact of the floods on Kenya’s agriculture was substantial, with estimates suggesting billions of Kenyan shillings (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/hunger-looms-as-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-in-east-africa-1393560) in crop damage and lost production. Additionally, the floods
triggered landslides and soil erosion.
This time, twice as much land is affected. Farmers in affected areas face a total crop failure, their entire livelihoods washed away. The flooding of 2,000 acres of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001494684/food-crisis-looms-as-farmers-warn-of-total-crop-failure?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=may2024), for instance, is likely to result in losses to the tune of KSh60 million (about US$445,000) in lost crop. This doesn’t include the loss to businesses that would have used the crop.
So far, the basket regions – where most of the staple food production takes place – have been spared the worst of the flooding. However, there is a very high likelihood of perishable crops such as vegetables and pulses recording very low yields. They have shorter maturity and may have been waterlogged or swept away.
The effect on food security will likely be felt much longer. Though Kenya has yet to estimate the effect of the flooding on food production, in Tanzania – which exports food to Kenya – there are estimates that the floods will cause a 30% decline in production this year (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/ea-braces-for-hunger-as-floods-destroy-farms-4612440). Food prices will likely stay high.
**Cost to the purse**
Kenya’s economy is still recovering from shocks that include high debt distress, global food inflation and exchange rate shock.
The budget estimates (https://www.treasury.go.ke/budget-books-1/) for the next financial year reveal that the government has a delicate balancing act in trying to meet commitments as well as stimulating key sectors of the economy.
To cater for emergency response to the flooding situation, the government has forwarded a supplementary budget of Ksh11 billion (about US$80 million) (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/government-seeks-mps-nod-on-sh10-6bn-to-combat-floods--4613976) to the National Assembly for approval. This will likely all be spent to provide direct support to households, resettle displaced
households and reconstruct infrastructure such as schools and health facilities.
The government is already struggling to meet revenue targets (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kra-in-tough-race-to-collect-sh1-1-trillion-in-four-months--4562510#google_vignette) due to a slowdown in economic performance. The total reconstruction will cost much more, and will divert resources from other sectors.
**Better preparation**
Overall, the current flooding will have long-term effects on the economy. The turnaround depends on the choices that policymakers make. A balance has to be maintained between reconstruction efforts and support to productive sectors of the economy, while offering support to those that have been affected.
There is a need to learn from the current disaster to prepare better for the next climate shock.
First, the disaster response of county
governments must be strengthened. For instance, storm water drainage – blamed for much of the flooding in urban areas – is a county government function.
Second, there is a need for better coordination between government and non-state actors to ensure more efficient use of resources to support affected households.
Third, with climate shocks becoming more frequent, there is a need to invest in better weather prediction and early warning systems. Then there must be immediate action on the recommendations from these systems, including training for households in areas prone to disasters.
Fourth, better planning in urban settlements is needed. This includes proper maintenance of roads, bridges and drainage infrastructure, adherence to building codes and standards and environmental regulations – such as protection of riparian lands.
Finally, investing in generating and creating access to data can help to inform responses and improve planning for reconstruction after disasters.

DESPAIR IN HER EYES TOUCHED ME,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/9du4fm/despair_in_her_eyes_touched_me/,2018-09-07 13:02:42,Kenya,"I don’t give to beggars, I believe man should work not make begging a career. GOK hope you are listening, we don’t need #USAID or #GoodiesFromChina the are going to be our downfall as a country. But this #FeelGoodFriday I gave. Was walking in Ruiru Town and met a woman seated under a shade and she reached out to beg. As usual, I declined by shaking my head negatively, her reaction to this ran down my nerves and touched that empathetic, human part that I always thought I do not have. Realizing she was not gonna get any help from me, probably like it had happened with the other previous passersby, the woman raised her arms, held her head and softly whispered in despair, 'GOD'. One look at her reaction made me realize she was in a tight corner. From my own judgment, I dint think she was your normal beggar, she rather looked more like a mother, who was struggling with a bad season in her life, I imagined maybe she has little ones at home, waiting for her to take home something, maybe they have not eaten for some time because she looked like she was already starving herself and for once in a very long time. Empathy and a sense of humanity overcame me and walked back, reached into my pocket and gave her all the change I had; just about KES 300, I am not a rich man and I use Mpesa a lot instead of cash like any other digitalized young Kenyan  so that’s all I had right there. She smiled back and said thank you, I did not wonna bother her much with questions because I could not help beyond that (it was what I had there). So I left her and went back to the office and told my mate about it and she said, ‘you should have asked her story; maybe we could help her more.’ She is out looking for her maybe to add her a few shillings and having better social skills than me, learn a little of her story. 

But remembering that woman, and seeing how the government is trying to solicit more and more from its citizens with unbearable taxes that eventually end up in the pockets of a few looters or end up making developments that do not have a significant effect on ordinary Kenyan, I am deeply saddened. I am yet to see price of commodities decline due to cheap transportation using SGR, I am yet to see price of petroleum products go down now that we are net miners and probably in the near future exporters of crude oil, I am yet to see any positive sign that the country is headed for greatness, rather all I see right, left and center is Kenyans running into despair through an oppressive corrupt system/Government and news of big monies being lost to a few fat or fattening Kenyans who are supposed to be the guardians of the public funds. I see this as an evil parent who keeps asking and asking from his children rather than supporting them. I don’t know where Kenya is headed, but I know there should be a solution. 

For me the solution is simple: Don’t borrow, spend what we have effectively (prioritize good development, cut on losses through looting), and build capacity sequentially through net saving to create investments, control population growth (this should be in caps or bold, if you can only feed yourself, you don’t need to have babies, get a wife/husband who can also feed themselves and make a family of two, one person is enough to console, no need bringing to earth another person who you can’t support, they will make your life harder, and live a miserable life themselves) till we become self-reliant nation. We can’t look to live extravagantly on borrowed monies and expect that this will not turn back to haunt us in the near future.

I’m a 24 year veteran of the Washington Post, and my first trip to Venezuela was back in 1999, when[I interviewed the late leftist revolutionary Hugo Chavez shortly after he won the presidency](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/07/27/in-venezuela-a-revolution-from-the-top/73abb025-5596-4925-a62b-24dce5a47f00/?utm_term=.aa2902288c9c). In that interview, he foreshadowed the dramatic changes ahead from his socialist “Bolivarian revolution.”

Almost two decades later, his successor Nicolas Maduro is at the helm, and Venezuela is a broken nation.

In a series of recent trips to Venezuela, I’ve taken a closer look at the myriad problems facing the country. It has the [world’s highest inflation rate,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/how-hyperinflation-stole-christmas-in-venezuela/2017/12/22/0a85e876-e06a-11e7-b2e9-8c636f076c76_story.html?utm_term=.1aecb43264fd) massive poverty, growing hunger and a [major health care crisis.

[Proof](https://twitter.com/Anthony_Faiola/status/1004831135959003136)
