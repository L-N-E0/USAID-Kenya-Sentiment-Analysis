Kenya,The end of USAID means Kenyan's losing their jobs,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ii4bja/the_end_of_usaid_means_kenyans_losing_their_jobs/,1738738664.0,246,"There is probably a whole industry of local Kenyan workers in NGOs and other organizations that were benefiting from US dollars in the form of USAID funding and other organizations. People who were getting Ksh400k salaries and much better than that for doing much less work than their neighbours. Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents. Its become impossible for normal hustlers to find a decent place to live near Nairobi.

I wonder what happens to these people, can they find a job somewhere else?

Also Trump has not finished, there will be more cuts, more funds and organizations that are shut down. I wonder how much the Kenyan economy was getting out of the inefficiency and extravagance of US spending??"
Kenya,USAID wasn't worth it.,92,https://i.redd.it/cxv28znrhohe1.jpeg,1738917250.0,198,"It has come to light that USAID had been funding private institutions for obvious reasons.

Kenya,"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job",185,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iny5w8/finally_its_gets_deeper_i_lost_my_job/,1739385553.0,74,"With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime. 


For those who have lost their jobs due to the USAID cuts how are you navigating? "

Children have been removed from big private school. Husband is a big guy at PWC. Lifestyle changes are occurring rapidly as her income has vanished. Thousands of her USAID coworkers were sent home with no salaries. 

USAID Vendors, contractors, non-profits that received funding from them have all been left in a lurch. Sasa machozi zimeanza. 

Next is empty apartments around “high class” areas.

UN is laying people off left right and center.

Additionally, public assistance programs in the Europe and America are being slashed so remittances by a certain sector are falling.

If you think things are hard, ngojeni mpaka December. A lot of your highlife hotspots are about to close. A lot of these restaurants are about to close.

Kenya,Economy,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jsytyp/economy/,1743958901.0,15,"For the experts in matters economy and finance I ask this politely(mnielezee Kama mtoto tafadhali). How is our country still semi functional? Everyday we hear cases of billions lost here billions lost there. Sometime there was reports of I think 1.3 trillion irregularly withdrawn from the treasury, the dollar has surprisingly been stable at around 129 despite all this and there was the case where funding would be halted by the USAID. How has the economy not crashed yet? Is it normal to lose a third of the budget and still have a running country?"

Almost 500k Kenyans(households) are set to lose their source of livelihood, diseases are about to spike in Africa which could've been prevented via vaccination which was funded by USAID lakini Trump ni nani

Although I don't advocate dependency as a country this one will however have a serious effect on Kenya and Africa as a whole considering corruption crisis as whole

Lakini someone said if our president can renovate the state house with billions then he also has the ability to fund the most important program ""Children Vaccination Program"" sio tu kuleta mapastor wazungu huku. 

either way the effects itaonekana before hii mwaka iishe

Kenya,USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,1738915577.0,2,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back."
Kenya,DESPAIR IN HER EYES TOUCHED ME,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/9du4fm/despair_in_her_eyes_touched_me/,1536325362.0,18,"I don’t give to beggars, I believe man should work not make begging a career. GOK hope you are listening, we don’t need #USAID or #GoodiesFromChina the are going to be our downfall as a country. But this #FeelGoodFriday I gave. Was walking in Ruiru Town and met a woman seated under a shade and she reached out to beg. As usual, I declined by shaking my head negatively, her reaction to this ran down my nerves and touched that empathetic, human part that I always thought I do not have. Realizing she was not gonna get any help from me, probably like it had happened with the other previous passersby, the woman raised her arms, held her head and softly whispered in despair, 'GOD'. One look at her reaction made me realize she was in a tight corner. From my own judgment, I dint think she was your normal beggar, she rather looked more like a mother, who was struggling with a bad season in her life, I imagined maybe she has little ones at home, waiting for her to take home something, maybe they have not eaten for some time because she looked like she was already starving herself and for once in a very long time. Empathy and a sense of humanity overcame me and walked back, reached into my pocket and gave her all the change I had; just about KES 300, I am not a rich man and I use Mpesa a lot instead of cash like any other digitalized young Kenyan  so that’s all I had right there. She smiled back and said thank you, I did not wonna bother her much with questions because I could not help beyond that (it was what I had there). So I left her and went back to the office and told my mate about it and she said, ‘you should have asked her story; maybe we could help her more.’ She is out looking for her maybe to add her a few shillings and having better social skills than me, learn a little of her story. 

But remembering that woman, and seeing how the government is trying to solicit more and more from its citizens with unbearable taxes that eventually end up in the pockets of a few looters or end up making developments that do not have a significant effect on ordinary Kenyan, I am deeply saddened. I am yet to see price of commodities decline due to cheap transportation using SGR, I am yet to see price of petroleum products go down now that we are net miners and probably in the near future exporters of crude oil, I am yet to see any positive sign that the country is headed for greatness, rather all I see right, left and center is Kenyans running into despair through an oppressive corrupt system/Government and news of big monies being lost to a few fat or fattening Kenyans who are supposed to be the guardians of the public funds. I see this as an evil parent who keeps asking and asking from his children rather than supporting them. I don’t know where Kenya is headed, but I know there should be a solution. 

For me the solution is simple: Don’t borrow, spend what we have effectively (prioritize good development, cut on losses through looting), and build capacity sequentially through net saving to create investments, control population growth (this should be in caps or bold, if you can only feed yourself, you don’t need to have babies, get a wife/husband who can also feed themselves and make a family of two, one person is enough to console, no need bringing to earth another person who you can’t support, they will make your life harder, and live a miserable life themselves) till we become self-reliant nation. We can’t look to live extravagantly on borrowed monies and expect that this will not turn back to haunt us in the near future.

Africa,Planning an Outreach to an Internally Displaced Persons' Camp in Abuja.,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/ovu0e9/planning_an_outreach_to_an_internally_displaced/,1627831245.0,2,"Hello everyone, hope you are having a nice day.

I am an Intern Pharmacist in Nigeria and a couple of us, a multidisciplinary team of physicians, pharmacists, med lab scientists, nurses, and other volunteers are planning a medical outreach to an internally displaced persons' camp in Nigeria.

I'm sure most people caught up in world politics might be aware of the terrorist group Boko Haram and the havoc they have caused all over the country, most especially in the North Eastern part which has states like Yobe, Adamawa, Borno being the most affected. 

This has unfortunately led to a lot of their population being forced to move from their home states to be given santuary in other safer states, one of which is the country's capital, Abuja.

During a visit to one of the camps, particularly in Durumi, Garki-Abuja, we were shocked to find the living conditions of the camp.

The camp which has 215 households and housing a total of 2830 IDPs, is really lacking in provision of medical care, sanitary wears for the ladies, food, clothing, etc.

A couple of the health interns, particularly in the National Hospital, Abuja, decided to organize an outreach in which we could offer help to the camp particularly to focus on providing Medical Checkups, offering Counselling and Pharmaceutical Care to the individuals of the camp.

As regards to female hygiene we aim to offer sanitary wears to the ladies as well as hold talks with the female populace to create more awareness on proper female hygiene.

The proposed date of the outreach is on the 5th of September 2021 and this is a video reel showing not only a brief documentary into the camp, but highlights a couple of our members counting down to the event.


[Vimeo Link](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8707016)


We have tried to speak to some government authorities in order to get any sort of assistance/funding but that has been unsuccessful so far.
Hence, we have to try and source for the funding ourselves while we hope for the best.

Hence i am here just taking a swing and hoping we get a couple of inspired individuals who can help and donate to our cause.

We are in talks with a couple of Pharmacies and Pharmaceutical companies on trying to procure drugs so we can at least alleviate some of their problems but it has not been an easy task so far.

Kindly consider chipping in a donation of service or funds. Your help will go a long way in ensuring the success of the outreach.

If you’d like to make a donation, kindly use our flutterwave account, as a Gofundme has a restriction on Nigerian donors.

Thank you so much for your proposed support.

Again this is a video reel where you can have a peek into the current conditions of the camp.
It will be updated regularly of course.
