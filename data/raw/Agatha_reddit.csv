"USAID left a month ago, do we have ARVs in Kenya?","Someone on a different group (different website) was asking if now that USAID is gone, does kenya still have ARV medications? Like can people go for PEP? or those who are infected are they still getting their meds???

  
If not then we are about to enter an epidemic, where people infected start infecting others at a higher rate. Since for many people, when taking the medications they were less risk of infecting others.",Kenya,muerki,2025-04-15 13:16:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jzrn2s/usaid_left_a_month_ago_do_we_have_arvs_in_kenya/,3,5,usaid kenya
Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business.",Kenya,Morio_anzenza,2025-04-07 04:21:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,169,95,usaid kenya

Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

Ignorance or malice?,"I have just watched the MP of Homa Bay defending Trump, saying the reason he does so is because of his stand on LQBTQ+ rights.

Trump is the same man who called African countries shithole countries, and is currently trying to end USAID. Correct me if I'm wrong, but does Homa Bay not have the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya. Shouldn't he want organizations like USAID to keep on working in healthcare, since they supply ARVs and other stuff for cheaper rates than if we went out there and bought them ourselves.

Karibu na mzuri! A day in the life of a job seeker.,"Sijui  niite bahati ama kuponea chupu chupu. Nimeitiwa hustle flani nikiwa hapo CBD , nayo mimi afisa mtiifu wa Generali Shillingi ya Kenya nikareport post . post ilikua hapo kamukunji.  I was given a days contract as clerk wa kudistribute  ""jst arrived"" USAID relief food , in my mind I was like this is God , I arrived in town that morning for an interview ya izi mboka za gulf .Anyways kijana nimepiga m&s zangu  za pale T2 safi , navy blue pants n a white shirt, chini  nimefunga hesabu na dark brown boots , Clarks flani I scored gikomba na bei ya Sunday (btw Sunday bei NI ya -wananchi-) .

Alright post pleasantries tume exchange na mama Mikey, ( shes the one who called me in )  nikaonyeshwa desk na mine forms pale tayari , lakini si mnajua Tu mambo ya hii serikali msongo, relief food kwa TV walishapiga picha za exchange handshake, lakini kwa ground Lori ya mikate ndo imefika pekee sasa NI tutegee Lori ya unga na mafuta iko hapo' Uhuru highway'.  

20mins wait ishageuka 3 hrs , ata wenye walikua wamekujia hio aid ikabidi warudi home na hustle kidogo afu wakam mabadae, Mimi nilitoka kwetu malaa 5:30 morning ndo nimake interview ya 8:00 anniversary towers, so pale kwa desk ya mine nishaanza kudrool , si fault yangu men, Kiti ilikua billionaire barn mesh , very comfortable thing ,miguu pale juu ya acquisition form za wenyewe,nikua Nishaanza kuota vile sasa hao clients na investors WA Kai and Karo wamehamia sasa kwa kampuni ya mine long story short niliamshwa na sauti ya glass wall ikimwagika, lakini vile hio sauti ilikua karibu I dared not open my eyes Mimi NI mgonjwa wa macho am keen to protect my eyes more than am eager to see whats happening.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Lifestyle changes are occurring rapidly as her income has vanished. Thousands of her USAID coworkers were sent home with no salaries. 

USAID Vendors, contractors, non-profits that received funding from them have all been left in a lurch. Sasa machozi zimeanza. 

Next is empty apartments around “high class” areas.

UN is laying people off left right and center.

Additionally, public assistance programs in the Europe and America are being slashed so remittances by a certain sector are falling.

"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back.",Kenya,random_raven,2025-02-07 08:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,1,2,usaid funding

The end of USAID means Kenyan's losing their jobs,"There is probably a whole industry of local Kenyan workers in NGOs and other organizations that were benefiting from US dollars in the form of USAID funding and other organizations.

Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents.

1. There hasn't been a budget for vaccines for newborns. What??? What the actual fuck!? Thinking about how BCG needs to be administered like within the earlier weeks of life, what do you actually mean hakuna vaccines? And the ones who can't afford private hospitals, how will those babies live?

2. There is no budget for national exams. That one I knew but kitu sikujua, these morons (apologies, or not,  if you're part of the team) are launching a new system KEMIS to consolidate all education systems and learners and professionals, idk man do the research. And guess what, the system exists ni vile inaitwa NEMIS. Sounds familiar, huh? (SHIF/NHIF)

3. I won't even touch on the Sugar Mills, the budget cuts for  the education and health sectors, the state house budgets, the new MP salary increase. Yho nishukisheni.

4. There was an idiot on Citizen news this morning defending the presidency saying 200k jobs have been created. Where? And going abroad for work isn't it. Must I go to another country to get greener pastures? Why can't we empower our own people to build here? 

Liiiiiikeee all I see is damage that will take years to undo.

Eg Jana I was on the expressway and thinking, this structure will start earning Kenyans money in the 2050s, wtf!! 

This is definitely betrayal in the city juu kama we're living in Mstahiki Meya.

Anyways, may the force be with you all. Happy Friday ☺️


Edit: Kenya is in her sixties and can't do shit to sustain herself. I would imagine someone in their sixties who has had even a billionth of the wealth we do, would have built a system that can at least sustain their people but hey, here we are!",Kenya,Pristine_Peanut5349,2025-05-16 05:08:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1knswt1/some_bad_news_for_you/,159,59,usaid budget cut
Did people get comfortable with the way the country is being run? Where is the rage?,"I just woke up to the news that the budget for the KNH burns unit has been slashed by 900 million, there is no money for this year's exams. Mkumbuke this government reduced budget ya healthcare by 7 billion, education by 30 billion, roads by 14 billion, and irrigation by 3.7 billion. I could go on and on about the essential services budgets that have been cut in the last 6 months. 

Meanwhile, MP salaries were increased, and the budget to renovate state house was increased. There was outrage over the conspicuous consumption by most political leaders last year before the J25 protests. Sai karibu MPs wote, governors and senators have choppers and top range vehicles. Ministers are balling at the expense of the taxpayers. Everything since J25 got worse and the rage has continued to reduce and when I say J25 was not organic you people insult me. There has been no tangible action by Kenyans since then. The conversation on the reconstitution of IEBC was never had. What happened to collecting signatures to recall MPs? Where is that rage now? Ama watu wanangoja influencers na activists waseme waende streets? It is needed now more than ever before. Kenyans need to wake up. There is no meaningful change that will come from digital activism.

Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes.

Freelance 101 - Kenyan edition,"So I thought to make this post to those curious about freelancing and also to my fellow freelancers - to avoid getting screwed over by clients. I'll lean especially to the latter because I've been screwed over personally and the guys curious about freelancing can follow along, you can pick a thing or two.

Also, I'm a software engineer. Regardless, what I'll say will cut across different freelance niches.

The Nevers (Do Nots):
```
1. Never pick up a project, or rather start one, without discussing the payment contract. In writing. Yes, both you and the client should have a copy of the payment contract - for both of y'all's sakes. This payment contract (freelance contract, whatever you want to call it) should list the client's expectations - that is, the scope of work, the requirements, etc. Basically everything that you, as the freelancer, should do within the client's budget. This is to avoid overworking or being underpaid - more on that later on.

2. Never start working on a project without receiving the deposit. Again, this should be stated in the contract. Ideally, the deposit should be half of the total payment. Think of it as a commital fee, to show that the client is serious. If it's a big project, yes, still receive the deposit but split the rest of the payments into milestones, that is, after doing milestone A, you're to receive a portion of the remainder payment.

I can't stress the first 2 enough.

3. This is subjective, but don't turn down a gig either because the client's budget is low or because you think you're under qualified. If the budget is too low, revise the client's expectations and show him/her what can be done with his/her budget. If you're under qualified, you're allowed to bite off more than you can chew (but wisely, not blindly) - it's also how you learn by taking on bigger intimidating projects. While still on being under qualified, who said you have to do the work alone? Outsource to your friends (who are in the same field and skilled to take the project on) or whoever you know can take on that project. Again, enter into a contract with the person you've outsourced. This way, if a project is beyond you, you still get a portion of the money by splitting with whoever you've outsourced.

4. Do not operate like a charity. After sales services? Maintenance work? Updates? If those are not stated in your contract, you're not obliged to do them post-work. Ladies and gentlemen, this is where I'd love to introduce what I love to call a ""maintenance fee"" or a ""retainer"". If you've worked a sales job, you know very well what a retainer is. If you've entered into a big project and you know after you're done, you're not really done and there's some things that need to be done regularly, this is where a maintenance fee/retainer comes in. For example, you've built an e-commerce site and the client needs to be adding more products occasionally. That's not your work, it's his/hers. Yes, during the contract, you might state that you'll do like 20 product placements, but that's it. Anything more, the client has to pay you for it. Same with a blog site. The site needs regular updates or something's broken, yes, the client has to pay. And for goodness' sake, do offer training to your client post-work on how to use what you built for him/her.
```

The Do's:
```
1. For crying out loud, do clearly define the scope of work. Yes, this includes the number of revisions too. A revision is a deviation/change from the original agreed piece of work. You've designed something, the client starts telling you the ""oh's"" ""oh, can you change this?"", ""oh can you add this?"", etc etc. Yes, revisions are unavoidable but do clearly state in your contract's scope of work, how many revisions you're willing to do within the project budget. Anything past that will incur additional costs. Remember, you're not a charity (I mean, unless you are).

2. Do charge for designs/mockups. No, not a template you stole (borrowed) from somewhere and are showing it to the client. This is for those clients where you're designing or building something from scratch. For graphic designers, well, this falls under revisions. For developers and/or other designers. This is the design that the system/project will follow. If UI/UX guys are paid, who says that you, as a developer should do the design for free?

3. Do overstate the project timeline. You can finish the project in a week? Nice, but don't say that you can. You know your capabilities. Stretch that timeline by a couple of days (or weeks) to give yourself a breathing room. Even if you can finish it in 3 days, you're not showing off to anyone. Calm your horses. Bonus: that way, you can work on something else in the meantime.

4. Do have a portfolio ready. Past projects you've done. Testimonials. etc.
```

Where the big money's at?
```
1. Team up: So you've been rawdogging things alone. Sometimes it's dry and no referrals are coming your way. This is where you form a team to tackle on projects together. The team should have complimentary skill sets. For a web design team, there's the designer, the front end guy and the back end guy, for example. In the beginning, yes, you're doing everything by yourself but your client base will only be ever so big. With a team, clients can trust you more and you're able to attract bigger clients. And of course, please for the love of everything that's good, let there be someone in your team who's good at PR/marketing - basically someone who's well connected to look for clients. That guy doesn't even have to be as technical as you but trust you me, you'll appreciate having such a guy versus not.

2. Skill up. Research. Seriously, you can't be crying that what you're doing isn't paying enough but truth be told, the same skillet you had when you started is still the same one that you're using and oh my goodness, you're expecting better pay and better clients? Insanity? Doing the same thing expecting different results. Want more money? Research what's paying more and learn that and then start doing it. KISS (no, I didn't kiss you... That's me telling you to Keep It Simple, Stupid. Respectfully).
```

How do I get clients?
```
Wouldn't we all like to know? If you know something, please do share. I mean that seriously, and sarcastically. But uh, speak to more people, connect with more people, and put yourself (and your skill sets) out there. You never know who's listening or who you'll meet. They might just be your next client.
```

Familiarity (working with close friends/family/relatives):
```
1. Family: Don't be a jerk to them. Do what you can for them. Actually, these are the best people to test your skills with. With an outsider, you can't fuck around and not find out. With family, you can. And you'll grow. Seriously, don't underestimate family. Some of your next clients will come from them. And I'm not saying this lightly.

2. Close friends: I'll keep it simple. Work with their budget. Next.

3. Relatives: Treat them as outsiders. Refer to the Nevers and the Do's. Well, not always. Depending on your relationship, some relatives are like family and thus almost similar benefits. But that random cousin/aunt/uncle - do treat them as outsiders.
```

This was pretty subjective. Based on personal experience. Based on what I've seen and heard from other freelancers.
Source: trust me bro.

"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back.",Kenya,random_raven,2025-02-07 08:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,1,2,usaid budget cut

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

The end of USAID means Kenyan's losing their jobs,"There is probably a whole industry of local Kenyan workers in NGOs and other organizations that were benefiting from US dollars in the form of USAID funding and other organizations. People who were getting Ksh400k salaries and much better than that for doing much less work than their neighbours. Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents. Its become impossible for normal hustlers to find a decent place to live near Nairobi.

USAID and Self reliance,"USAID has been scrapped and a section of Kenyans and Africans are largely celebrating the move claiming it will lead to self reliance and all that,which to be clear is a good thing, a lofty Ideal.

But I can't help but notice something those making those tik toks and tweets are mainly urban, middle class folks, you know the kind of people who probably don't rely on USAID for survival. Now since we can't build capacity to manufacture vaccines and ARVs immediately even if we wanted to and don't get me started on changing our leadership, fighting corruption and all that...none of that can happen immediately, it may take years ,perhaps even decades. My question to them is ,How many infants are you willing to see die of measles, malnutrition, polio etc in your quest for self reliance? Is it 1? 10? 100? 1000? 10,000? 100,000? How many lives are worth sacrificing for self reliance?

Now if you haven't been about the country, it may be easy to read some article in a newspaper or a tweet claiming that this professor or that think tank did a research that found aid doesn't reach their intended target and take it as gospel truth ,you may even retweet some retards' claims that the UN is useless,UNICEF is useless, WHO is useless and all that, but those of you who have been in distressed and conflict ridden areas know how absolutely crucial USAID and the UN are.

An example during the height of the last drought an estimated 4 mn Kenyans were at risk of starvation, now if you budget kes 150 for every individual per day i.e food ,distribution and administrative costs that's about 600 mn kes per day or 18bn per month. Inevitably someone will come and say but 'we lose 2bn to corruption everyday', 'we can grow our own food (completely ignoring the fact that areas that are hit hardest by famines are normally populated by nomadic pastoralists and telling them to grow their own food or practice zero grazing entails a huge lifestyle change which again takes time) and all those talking points they seem to have, but these are long term fixes but now we need a solution Now since people's lives are at risk.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-02-05 06:17:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ii3qam/usaid_and_self_reliance/,3,3,usaid budget cut
Freelancing is hard sometimes,"I'm a UI/UX designer and last year this dev i work with had a client who needed a website for their business designed. I had a discovery call with the client so I could get more info and then after I told the dev that the client's budget wasn't enough for the work she needed. He convinced me to just take the job and help the business get started to which I agreed. 

The work was done, payment was completed and I handed over to the dev. And the website was successfully launched.

I retained the client's contact and later I'd see them post their private life (their family seems wealthy). And even got to discover that they were in tech and earning well from it.

Which meant that this person could afford to pay us well but chose not to. Weeks later the client gave me a call and told me they had a potential client then asked how much I'd give them as a cut if they referred me. Man nilishangaa bana bc wtf is that. 

How do you lowball someone then have the audacity to ask for a cut if you refer them?

Conspiracy theorists assemble,"I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like reading them and I like thinking about possible conspiracy theories. The current one I am thinking about is Ruto deliberately sabotaged Raila’s AUC bid so that Raila can still be useful to him in local politics. If Raila won the chairmanship, the broad based government and narrative would have become less important for his coalition and as a result, Raila would not activate his local political networks to keep Ruto in power. 

How have those networks been utilised since the coalition? All protests have been infiltrated by “goonz”. Is this just a coincidence? You tell me.

The goonz have been extremely successful in dissuading young kenyans from protesting. The protests last year were gaining momentum and threatened to reach unprecedented levels until the goonz came in. Now every protest is overrun by goonz.

By disrupting protests, Ruto is hoping to lessen the negative press his administration is facing, safeguard his position and further solidify his budding authoritarian regime. The networks he gained through the coalition have been crucial in doing that.

If Raila won the AUC seat, I believe his focus would have been on his new role and it would have also undermined his leadership if his home country is at the forefront of committing human rights violations which is what Ruto’s administration would continue to do to deal with the protests. So what does Ruto and his aides do? Make the most outlandish statements before the AUC elections that weaken Kenya’s position amongst member states, costing Raila the seat and ensuring the only thing that will keep him occupied is the bread based government.


That is my theory.

Feel free to call it story za Jaba because like I said, I like conspiracy theories and I find them an interesting way to try and analyze the madness going on in this country.

Kenyans in Diaspora,"I have recently been digging into challenges that Kenyans in diaspora face while investing in real estate and construction here in Kenya. Some include trusting incompetent relatives to manage their developments and falling into offplan scams. Whereas there are others who have successfully managed to invest with less issues. 

In regards to this, I have been keen on trying to come up with a turnkey construction solution where there is a firm that offers investment packages for enthuastic Kenyans in diaspora as well as foreigners. The packages include Design-Build, Design-Build-Operate and Build only. I believe offering a trustworthy construction  and project manager who will ensure proper management of their remittances and provide timely and efficient progress reports and milestones reports is probably what they need. In collaboration with a team of a law firm, a trusted real estate firm and maybe a few contruction works subcontractors, I think it would work and I will be able to facilitate their dream of becoming property owners.

Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!. A continuation of the 1970's and 1980's second crisis of Economic theory between the two Cambridges.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2. Methodology from https://dsbb.imf.org/e-gdds/dqaf-base/country/KEN/category/NAG00. **FYI** You can calculate GDP via 3 approaches - **Income**(sources of funds), **Expenditure**(uses of funds) & **Output**(production of goods/services). To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Considering moving to Kenya,"I’m long time follower, first time posting…
I’m married to a Kenyan and always loved it when visiting. Recently we’ve been exploring the idea of moving there. I’m looking for pros, cons, and suggestions to consider before making a big decision. 

I have always felted welcomed and at home there, and am ashamed that my birth country is the exact opposite to immigrants. How do you feel about the attitude towards immigrants moving to Kenya is headed? 

I have 3 kids in primary. I understand there will be schooling fees for them to finish school, but am more concerned of college. What are the challenges I should consider for my children? 

Although I’m a professional, I would likely start a business. What are the challenges to having a business there? Will I need a business license or insurances? Any resources to research? 

I’ve seen Nairobi grow a lot over the last 10 years but am also considering Nakuru and Kisumu. What other area are worth considering or needing to avoid for foreigners?

"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”

"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

•	When (and where) do you expect to retire?

Also, given our income levels, extended family responsibilities, and economic challenges, do you think FIRE is realistic in the Kenyan context?

Racism - how often do you as a Kenyan feel racially attacked?,"I have lived half of my life in Kenya. I've just returned to Kenya and after living abroad in developed countries, my perspective is pretty different now.

I grew up with an Indian ethnic background so it felt normal at the time but now, I have realized that most indians in Kenya are pretty racist towards black Kenyans. They don't pay well, they don't treat them like humans at work places, and worst of all, there's no trust amongst anyone.

I understand that Kenya is ridden with poverty and there's a huge disparity in income and wealth. The amount of corruption in the government prevents them from setting up financial aids for people with disabilities, for people who have lost a job, for health issues, whatever it may be, it's lacking.
This further increases the struggle in this country so I find that everyone is grinding and always seeking ways to make money even if it's ""chai"" 50-100kshs.

However, I find that the racism goes both ways and I can't exactly place the blame on any single race or single person. It's been happening for generations and it's just a norm unfortunately.

Indians who have money or are employers always make the decisions to pay less (not even minimum wage), they don't give work safety equipment or maintain facilities to a standard.

On the other hand, black Kenyans only look at indians as a way to make money and nothing more.

I went out for a walk this week and got approached like 20 times at the very least where people stare at me or my clothes or whatever it may be, they approach and beg for money or try force me to buy things even if I've said I'm not looking to buy.

If people were to call the police on racism or unfair treatment, all that happens is the police will ask for a bribe and it'll get swept under the rug, likely the black Kenyan will get fired anyway and be at a loss with no justice.

If we want Kenya to progress as a country, this shit needs to stop. Police gotta be more righteous and stop with the bribery and actually enforce rules. I notice most police don't do any actual work, they go around looking for ways to extort people for money. It could be a simple traffic thing like at the roundabouts near town, there's no need for this. Use these resources more wisely.

I remember back in 2014 I was trying to get my ID but I lost the original. I had to go get an obstruct from the police station and they said to me ""why do you think you can just get us to give you an obstruct if you can't pay us"" and I'm thinking nahhh you're a public servant, not a paid service.. and then when I go back to the ID office, the same guy who asked me to get an obstruct tells me why did you bother doing all this when you could've just paid me some money and I'd have fastracked the process for u without needing an obstruct.

It's literally in every situation. I wanna know what you guys think and if I'm being ridiculous or if there really needs to be a change. Btw I haven't even scratched the surface of what other shit goes on in this country on a daily basis. So much theft and corruption on top of the racism. 

Edit- I apologize for using ""black Kenyans"" when referring to native Kenyans. I don't mean to offend anyone but I'm glad people called me out on this, this discussion/post is for all of us to learn and treat each other better; to increase awareness and get our thoughts provoked into understanding what we need to change about ourselves, eventually (ideally rather), we can slowly start making a difference in how we approach other humans",Kenya,Aggravating-Ad-4367,2025-05-19 08:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kq6n2s/racism_how_often_do_you_as_a_kenyan_feel_racially/,39,116,kenya foreign aid

Nigerians annoying everyone everywhere they go. Arabs flooding France. Pakistanis and Bengalis dirtying the UK, Afghans and Syrians sexually abusing German women…

So the fact that many Kenyans are tired of all of you immigrants or fake ‘expats’ or real expatriates (who never want to leave when your contracts are completed), or you phony missionaries who come here to corrupt people with your religions, or you foreign pedophiles opening “children’s homes”, or you passport bros, or you silly African Americans with your YouTube channels and coloniser mentality offering ‘consultation’ and ‘relocation’ services to a country you think belongs to you (you belong in your West African ancestral land)….

You are not special.

You are just like any other immigrants around the world of any color who are disturbing the local populace.

And this Kenyan local populace is starting to behave like the populace in YOUR home country that doesn’t want any more immigrants.

Kenyans are not docile. We are not background characters in your relocation adventures for your YouTube channels and Instagram stories.

We are just like any other people who are tired of foreigners.

The entire planet is shifting. Established societies are falling apart. There is strife.

Prepare yourselves for whatever eventuality comes here. Just like immigrants in Portugal and USA and everywhere else are facing a new reality.

International teacher salary in Kenya,"Hey all,

So I am a Mzungu foreign teacher.  I currently have a largely online teaching job at a school in the US.  This enables me to escape to Kenya for a handful of months per year (but, working US hours in Nairobi gets long fast).

The good part, obviously, is the US pay (I make about 500k/month in ksh).

The political climate in the States is totally going to crap and things are happening that I really do not support or agree with... We are definitely in the process of falling under an authoritarian regime and little can be done to stop the momentum by this point.  I absolutely want to leave this country on a more permanent basis than my 2 month trips.

I have looked into moving to Colombia and have a few contacts there at international schools that pay very well for the area (just shy of US$2K/mo... 250k ksh/mo).

I am also interested in spending a year or two teaching in Kenya and was wondering about the salary for international teachers?  I would be coming with about 3.5 M ksh in liquid savings, and another 7 M ksh in stocks (if need be).  I could also rent out my US home for, hopefully, some additional revenue.  Could I make it work without using too much of my liquid savings??

FTR, I teach high school science.  I have visited my friend's nephew's elementary school one time to pick him up in Mukuru (Nairobi) before and saw what the teachers had to work with... Not sure if that's due to location, elementary school level, or anything about the market for international, licensed teachers.

Does anyone in here have any experience that they could share??

"Not all skin folks are kin folks: Black American state operatives, espionage against Africans, for white power structures.","
This is an example of one of the many black American kin folks under pentagon/state department rats working for white power structure against Africans. He started his espionage assignment in 1996 in Senegal, then later moves to Uganda where he camouflaged as a music teacher and singer until 2019.

His job, in his own words, “was to spot, assess, develop, and recruit spies to help our nation."" 

These are the kind of rats that have no conscience in helping white supremacists maintain their control and continue keeping black Americans down through systemic assassination of black American rights activists like Malcolm X and Martin Luther. 


In the ideal world, black Americans would be valuable resource to Africa in terms of tourism, capital and skills. They posses unique experience and exposure. However, looking at how they've systematically backstabbed their own back home, it's a guarantee these people will be no different here. 
In fact, it is almost certain they they are going to work against us, even more confidently and treacherous than their white folks. Skin colour gives them unchallenged advantages in matters espionage. They can easily blend in. Black, they look like us, they are our people, king lost kins. Most importantly, the average African mind does not immediately suspect them, nor sees them as potential enemies in national, political and economic matters compared to white males who are the embodiment of white supremacism, colonialism, treachery, murder and plunder of the Africa. These makes black Americans unparalleled capabilities for espionage in Africa, even more lethal enemies than their white counterparts. 

It's almost certain this newly-found love towards Kenya, and Africa at large, is not organic. 

To begin with, they are equally racist, if not more, to Africans compared to their white counterparts. 

Almost all of these akatas have no families, they're coming as individuals, no wife/husband, no children, no clear reason why they are ""moving"" here, no clear income generating activity. Like who are they? Are they conservationists? Are they coming for business? Are they employed? I mean, Kenya is extremely expensive, especually for foreigners.

If it were SEA countries it would be understandable. Coz if you watch YouTube videos of countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines..etc, you could get a proper ksh 100/= meal, with chicken, beef of poke, and rice on the side. Not in Kenya.

So, you ain't fooling anybody Aaliyah. We have shortage of fools. 
YouTube income cannot foot your posh ksh 50,000 per month apartment in Kilimani, Uber rides, weekly clubbing and monthly outings to Maasai Mara, Amboseli, Diani, and Watamu.

Kenya Isn’t That Bad… Ama?,"So I have this friend who lives in Europe. Since last year, he’s been on my case:  
“Why are you still in Kenya? You could be making 300k a month over here.” He paints Europe like it's Wakanda with WiFi.  
And I’m just here like....relax, my guy.

We happened to bump into each other during his vacation here. I was out vibing like I usually do, random place, random people...and because I talk a lot, we somehow got deep into convo before I even remembered to ask for his name.

Now this guy has a whole script in his head about Kenya. Sure, things are tough, but he’s talking like I live in a mud hut with goats and chicken making a mess everywhere. I mean, yes! economy is bad, lakini hata kama! We’re not at war. We're not dodging bombs. We're just dodging bad network and inflated prices.

And then... he drops The Plan; “We could get married. Not for real, for papers. It’ll be easier for you to come to Europe that way.You can live with me while you find your footing. I’ll help until you get a job.

Ehhh?

Sir wants to marry me for logistics. Not love. Not vibes. Just… simplified relocation. He clearly watches too many K-dramas. Because this sounded like:  
— Pack your bags  
— Say goodbye to mum  
— Marry the homie  
— Live in a foreign country as a “wife”  
— Hope he stays normal until I find a job  
— And pray he doesn’t change his mind mid-process  

Skia kunipanga! Eii!! Karibu nipatwe na muhadharaa!! 
He really thought I’d say yes like I’ve been sitting here manifesting a stranger-sponsored escape plan. As if I’m a USB drive he can just eject from Kenya and plug into Europe.

And it made me think...how do some of these people see us? Like we’re all lining up to leave? That we’re desperate to escape? That we’d marry for convenience just to access greener lawns?

Sure, the country has its problems, but we’re not hopeless. We still love it here (I do, i don't know about you) There’s sunshine, there's you and a mad person that always claims not to be mad🥱. It’s madness, but it’s home.
So no! I’m not moving across continents to play “wife” in a show I didn’t audition for.  
Not now. Not like that. Kenya ni Kenya bana.Na mimi si handbag ya kutolewa tu kwa shelf.

Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

* Rift Valley delivered 78% of votes to Ruto in 2022. This base isn't eroding.
* Mt. Kenya may complain but historically votes for the incumbent (see Kibaki's 2007 re-election despite discontent).

**5. Our Neighbors Are Progressing While We Obsess Over Politics**

* Tanzania attracted **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank), while Uganda's **oil project** is projected to generate **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank). Furthermore, Uganda's **oil project** is expected to generate **2 billion** annually, starting in **2025** (Uganda Ministry of Energy).

Meanwhile, Kenya attracted just **$1.2 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the same period (CBK 2023 Report).

As of now, we're already in **2027 campaign mode.**

* Gen Z isn't getting IDs (only 1.2M new registrations in 2023 vs 6M eligible)
* Middle-class Kenyans will tweet but won't vote (42% turnout in urban areas)
* The poor will vote - and they'll vote for whoever meets their immediate needs

Like it or not, #TanoTena is coming. The numbers don't lie.

Do we have a national culture?,"⚠ Warning: ***long post***

But you might want to read it cause ***this is a whole PHD thesis!***

In this post, I argue that Kenya lacks a cohesive national identity. Countries like China, the UK, and the US have strong, recognizable national cultures shaped by histories that span centuries, if not millennia. These cultures, while internally diverse, are united by shared symbols, customs, and values. The baguette, for instance, is undeniably French. Americans proudly celebrate Thanksgiving, and the British are known for their deep-rooted traditions and institutions.

Kenya, on the other hand, doesn't share this same kind of national cultural cohesion. Our country is incredibly diverse—home to over 40 ethnic groups, each with its own unique culture. But instead of this diversity forming a mosaic that strengthens a national culture, our identities remain largely fragmented along ethnic lines. And even those cultural elements that survive are often at risk of erosion.

To make matters worse, we've become so westernized that indigenous cultures are frequently viewed as inferior. Having a native accent is often mocked—we call such people ""kienyeji,"" a term that’s both derogatory and undignifying. This mindset reflects a deep-rooted colonial hangover, where we were taught to aspire to whiteness—whether in language, behavior, or even skin tone. Skin bleaching, forced accents, and the obsession with foreign norms are all symptoms of this internalized inferiority.

Yes, we have national holidays, but how many people actually celebrate them with a sense of pride or belonging? How many of us can even speak fluently in our national languages? Among young urban Kenyans, especially, the dominant culture seems to be imitation of the West rather than celebration of what is uniquely Kenyan.

And sure, Kenya is a young nation. But if we continue down this path—if we keep rejecting our roots and failing to define who we are beyond colonial remnants—we will never form a truly Kenyan identity. At the moment, the only things we seem to collectively share as a nation are negative traits: weak democratic institutions, poor governance, rampant corruption, and a relentless pursuit of wealth at the expense of others.

If we are to ever forge a national identity, it must begin with reclaiming and respecting our own cultures—seeing value in who we are and what we already have.



***TL;DR:***
Kenya lacks a strong national identity, unlike countries like the US, UK, or China. Our deep ethnic diversity has led to fragmented cultures, and colonial influence has made many of us see indigenous ways as inferior. We imitate Western culture—from accents to skin tone—while national holidays and languages barely unite us. Until we reclaim and respect our own roots, we’ll struggle to define what it truly means to be Kenyan.

Kenya is in trouble a self inflicted Cuba,"We all know this but here is a deeper look into things:

Okay, Kenya’s corruption and the impunity surrounding it have thrown the country into economic conditions that closely mirror what happened to Cuba starting in 1962, when the U.S. slapped a full embargo on trade. The impact? Devastating economic retribution that crippled Cuba’s growth and sent it into long-term decline. That’s exactly what we’re seeing play out in Kenya right now.

If you want to know where Kenya is headed, just study Cuba’s past or take a close look at Venezuela. History is a mirror. Economics is not guesswork—it’s a science. When the same conditions are in place, the outcomes follow predictable patterns.

The Kenyan shilling is already weakening—and it’s not stopping there. What follows is what always follows: rising inflation, skyrocketing cost of living, collapsing public services, and widespread unemployment. Just like Venezuela, Kenya is headed into a storm of debt, capital flight, and a brain drain, where the educated and skilled seek stability elsewhere. Investment dries up. Confidence disappears. People lose hope.

Both Cuba and Venezuela also saw their currencies become almost meaningless, imports become luxuries, and public trust in institutions completely erode. Kenya is now walking that same path—except this time, it’s not a foreign embargo doing the damage. It’s our own doing. The corruption, the theft, the lack of consequences—it’s an internal embargo. And the price that Kenya is paying and will continue to pay is high.

Guys, this are not just some historical accounts but a stern warning. It seems like Kenya country is already in a sharp decline.

Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",Kenya,bravoyankee37,2025-04-07 19:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,4,3,kenya foreign aid

3. I'd look to do as affordable of a safari trip as possible while there. Is under $1K USD reasonable if I didn't need luxury accommodation and only wanted to do 3-4 days? 
4. I've heard a little bit about Mombasa but mainly only know it's a city by the sea in southern Kenya. Is that worth checking out at all? 

If the time and money is right, I'd consider adding Rwanda to this too mainly because I'm very interested in the country's history and I've heard it's good for gorilla treks. 

Appreciate any advice and tips in advance for consideration. ",Kenya,yankeeblue42,2025-04-02 04:52:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jpgopz/possible_kenya_winter_trip/,9,3,kenya foreign aid

Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",Kenya,luthmanfromMigori,2025-04-01 01:12:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,120,124,kenya foreign aid

As foreign aid declines and financial markets evolve, the traditional model of donor-led decision-making is fading.

Are Kenyans racist,"One issue that doesn’t get discussed enough is race and internalized biases in Kenya.

We often talk about tribalism, but what about how we treat people of different races? From the way we interact with white expats, to the treatment of Asians or even Black foreigners, are we unknowingly carrying forward colonial-era racial structures?

For example, why do some Kenyans associate wealth or authority with whitenessor how articulate one sounds? Why do certain racial groups seem to get preferential treatment in business or law enforcement? And on the flip side, are we unfairly hostile towards some communities because of historical grievances?

I’m not here to argue that Kenya is ""a racist country"" in the Western sense, but rather to spark an honest conversation: How much of our racial perceptions today are a colonial hangover? And what can we do to unlearn them?",Kenya,Admiral_chain_B95,2025-03-28 07:33:08,https://v.redd.it/lq1gkycjvdre1,76,49,kenya foreign aid

That one time an American soldier killed a Kenyan mother and got away with it,"Once an American soldier (Frank Joseph Sundstrom) raped and killed a Kenyan woman (Monica Njeri) a mother of two ,despite admitting to the murder, the American soldier was ordered to deposit a bond of 500 kshs and released on a pledge of good behaviour for 2 years. Yes released after murder. Btw this was hot on the heels of Moi's visit to the white house to ask for yellow maize as food aid.Yellow maize is primarily grown as livestock feed in the US, so we can basically  say our girl's killer walked so that we could eat Livestock feed, Poverty is the worst crime imaginable. You go to the US and even dare lay hands on anyone and see how fast they'll throw you in jail and throw away the key. 

I think we should include clauses in the next constitutional ammendment that expressly prohibit the permanent (i.e for a period exceeding 45 days) deployment of any foreign security agencies and troops and anyone found violating this provision should be prosecuted for espionage to the full extent of the law ,no backroom deals and such .

Why ?,"There are some things I don’t understand about sub-Saharan African countries, especially places like Kenya. The JFK files were released today, and people are discussing a CIA base in Kenya—which is interesting, but not surprising.

When Kenya fails to condemn Israel for genocide, when British soldiers at BATUK assault and kill young women, when a CIA base is exposed in our country, there’s always one common excuse thrown around:

> ""bUT tTHey hElp uS fIghT tErrORIsm, gIvE us wEapOns, and tRaIN our sOLdiers.""



Fair enough. But I can’t help but ask—why?

Why, after 60 years of independence, do we still have to surrender chunks of our sovereignty? Because make no mistake—allowing foreign military bases and intelligence agents to operate freely within your country is a loss of sovereignty. The big powers would never allow this nonsense on their soil.

Why do we have to outsource something as basic as military training and intelligence? During Moi’s era, you couldn’t speak a word against Nyayo before the Special Branch was on your neck. Yet today, we supposedly need foreigners to fight terrorism? And who’s to say they even have our best interests at heart? The US isn’t Kenya, so we can’t pretend our strategic interests are fully aligned.

Building an independent and capable security apparatus isn’t some luxury—it’s a basic function of a state. That’s why every powerful country invested in its defense industry immediately after independence. But in Africa? The IMF and Western institutions convinced us that defense is secondary—a distraction from ""development.""

Meanwhile, in Ethiopia, the air force has developed a light aircraft. It’s a small step, but that’s how progress begins. Kenya, on the other hand? We’ll probably sell part of our sovereignty to the US in exchange for some outdated 1980s-era planes, roll them out during a national parade, and call ourselves a ""regional power."" But in 40 years, where will we be?

Beyond defense—why do we produce nothing?

The first BCG vaccine was developed 104 years ago.
The first polio vaccine came 70 years ago.
The first ARVs were made 38 years ago.

And yet, to this day, Kenya—a country of 50 million people—produces none of these. We still rely on foreign donations for essential vaccines. Why?

When the US jammed GPS signals on a Chinese ship in 2009, China immediately started building its own GPS system—no second warning needed. When India was still poor in 1966, it founded the Serum Institute, which is now the largest vaccine producer in the world.

Meanwhile, Kenya has a vaccine institute, and all I see from them is officials attending conferences. I have yet to see a single scientific paper from Kenya Biovax.

So I ask again—why?

And please, don’t give me the generic ""corruption and bad leadership"" excuse. India, China, and Brazil in the ‘60s weren’t corruption-free either. This is a deep, structural issue. It’s the same mentality that made our ancestors see Vasco da Gama’s guns and never think of making their own.

There’s something fundamentally broken in our societies, and I don’t know what it is. But we better start figuring it out—fast.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-03-19 13:36:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jex4rq/why/,18,12,kenya foreign aid
"Kenya’s Foreign Policy: Weak, Directionless, and Powerless","The Margaret Nduta saga once again exposes Kenya’s weak foreign policy. In situations like this, countries usually leverage past diplomatic favors—hosting influential figures, providing aid, or supporting key UN resolutions—to negotiate better outcomes. But Kenya has none to cash in. Our foreign policy has long been defined by neutrality or blindly following the West, lacking any real independence. We can’t claim to be a regional power if all we do is issue generic statements about “peace” and “calling on both sides.”

Despite our history as a former settler colony that fought for independence through armed struggle (they called the Mau Mau terrorists, by the way), we still abstain from critical votes on Palestine. Compare that to South Africa’s stance. Meanwhile, Uganda projects power across the region—with troops in Somalia, the DRC, and even South Sudan to prevent conflict. They even provide security for the Equatorial Guinean president. And Kenya? We’re deploying police to Haiti while chaos brews in our own backyard. What exactly do we stand for? Because in geopolitics, if you stand for nothing, you get nowhere.

But let’s be real—you can’t have an independent foreign policy without military strength to back it up. Our air force still operates 1950s-era F-4 Phantoms. Just look at Sudan. If they, with their MiG-29s and Egyptian allies’ aerial refueling capabilities, decided to bomb Nairobi for hosting the RSF, what could we do besides wait for a UN condemnation? We need to step up. You can’t call yourself a regional power while Ethiopian raiders massacre 20 people inside your borders and even establish settlements.

Let’s get serious.

Politician Traitors Helping Foreigners Finish Us,"I am no conspiracy theorist (... ok, I am, but very justifiably), but I am mad as hell for what politicians and their friends are helping foreigners do so much damage to this country and its people. If you aren't mad about something today, I came across this news that mathematics will no longer be compulsory in school. As in how??? CBC is already doing so much damage to the future of this country that I am not sure we can recover in a single generation.  
Developing economies rely heavily on STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) professionals, and at the core of is mathematics. We have already watered down science subjects, rarely teach history that is our own or true, and engineering is just a facade. If you think I am lying just ask any qualified engineer whether the engineers board of Kenya is functional and forward-looking organization or a board of old grey-haired gatekeepers minting money from membership fees and kickbacks.

Colonial Conservation: How the They Are Taking Our Land in the Name of Wildlife and Carbon Credits,"Some time ago, Prince William sparked outrage by blaming Africa’s population growth for the continent’s declining wildlife (just laugh at that). His remarks have been criticized as deeply hypocritical - how does a father of three (in UK) lecture African families about having too many children? Many have also pointed out that the UK has a far higher population density than any part of Africa, yet no one blames British families for environmental destruction.

Kenyan ecologist Dr. Mordecai Ogada, co-author of *The Big Conservation Lie*, challenges this narrative. He argues that Africa’s population is not the problem. Indigenous communities have coexisted with wildlife for centuries, relying on the land for survival rather than exploitation. It is the same flawed argument that claims African communities that have lived with wildlife for centuries are the real threat, while Westerners who have driven much of their own wildlife to extinction, have the answers.

This same logic is used to justify land grabs in the name of conservation. In January 2025, a Kenyan court ruled that two conservancies established by the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) in Isiolo County were unconstitutional due to a lack of community consent. The court ordered the removal of NRT rangers and revoked their licenses. This is yet to happen. This ruling exposed a long-standing issue of Western-backed organizations, often with ties to British royalty, controlling vast tracts of African land under the guise of protecting nature. 

Several conservancies in Kenya have direct British links, including Soysambu Conservancy near Lake Elmenteita, Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, and Lewa Downs—where Queen Elizabeth II was staying when she learned of her ascension to the throne. **NRT alone controls 6.37 million hectares, an area larger than all of Kenya’s national parks combined.** These conservancies operate like private fiefdoms, where locals are often displaced or heavily restricted from accessing their own ancestral lands.

The idea that African communities are the biggest threat to nature is just another colonial myth. It’s the same argument that was used to justify European land grabs during colonization, Africans are incapable of managing their own land and resources, so the West must step in. But history tells a different story. Africa’s wildlife crisis is not due to overpopulation but to centuries of foreign exploitation, land grabs, and the prioritization of Western interests over African lives.",Kenya,Local-man-guru,2025-03-14 08:42:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jazcrd/colonial_conservation_how_the_they_are_taking_our/,3,3,kenya foreign aid

The Affordable Handshake: Will Ruto’s Dalliance with Baba Fade Before the Ink Dries?,"There is an african proveeb that says ""He who swallows a whole coconut must trust his anus."" 

Ruto has just swallowed the biggest political coconut of his life i.e shaking hands with Raila Odinga. And now, he must trust that his political stomach can digest it without embarrassing consequences. This is not just a handshake; it’s a full-course meal of survival politics, and Ruto knows that without Raila, his presidency risks serious indigestion.

Today’s handshake at State House wasn’t just a photo-op, it was Ruto and Raila signing their political death wish. And when the time comes, Gen Z, the undertaker, will conduct their final rites in August 2027.

Ruto, the self-proclaimed anti-dynasty warrior, has now tied his fate to Baba’s heartbeat. If, God forbid, Raila took an unscheduled trip to the ancestors tonight, Ruto would blow the entire 2025/26 national budget on witchdoctors, Silicon Valley AI, and importing foreign rogue pastors to try and resurrect him. And best believe, he’d out-mourn the Odinga familybwith his tears flooding the streets of Bondo while wearing the defeated look that Kimani Ichungwa had on Al Jazeera's Mehdi.

Forget the Finance Bill riots or Gen Z’s X Space rants—this would be the real crisis. Ruto, on his knees, wailing, “Hustlers, we need Baba back, or I’m finished!” Kenyan politics thrives on these dramatic alliances, and Ruto knows his Mount Kenya votes are already doing the Harlem Shake after Gachagua’s impeachment. Without Raila, he’s just a hustler with no dynasty to lean on.

Of course, Baba has been given billions, it’s become tradition at this point. But at 82, will he exhaust the billions before the sun sets on him? Will he have enough time to enjoy the spoils, or will nature cash its check before he does?

Another wise African Proverb says that a monkey that dances by the roadside must be prepared for stones.

For years, Ruto paraded himself as the anti-handshake champion, swearing he’d never share power with Raila. But today, the same Ruto is dancing by the roadside—and the stones are coming. The same Kenyans that roasted Uhuru for shaking Raila’s hand in 2018 is now polishing their slingshots, ready to fire at this new bromance. If Ruto thought Uhuru’s handshake was unpopular, wait till he sees what 2027 has in store.

Ruto has now invited Baba for tea faster than you can say ‘blood-based government.’ With ODM figures in Cabinet and Raila’s AUC bid flopped, Ruto’s presidency is basically a high-stakes chama where Baba is the treasurer holding all the cash 😂. If Raila checks out, Ruto’s left clutching a useless chequebook, out-crying the Odingas at the funeral, and begging the IMF for a loan to hire a time machine.

Meanwhile, Azimio diehards would scream deep state conspiracy, claiming Raila was taken out just to keep Kalonzo waiting forever.

Context is everything: Ruto’s been juggling a rebellious Mount Kenya, a sulky Uhuru, and a Gen Z movement ready to storm State House armed with Wi-Fi and vibes. Raila is his political oxygen mask—lose him, and he’s gasping in the thin air of 2027 re-election dreams. You’d see a state-sponsored sob-fest so dramatic, it’d make Mexican telenovelas jealous. The man might even pawn the Harambee House furniture to fund a “Resurrect Raila Taskforce” featuring NASA (the space agency, not the coalition) and a hotline to Wakanda.

This is peak Kenyan politics: one minute, you’re enemies; the next, you’re bromancing so hard that if one dips, the other is ready to bankrupt the nation and outweep the family, just to keep the show going.

Wait, was it a discounted dynasty alliance? Either way, Ruto just bought what he swore he’d never touch—at a price Kenya might soon start feeling.

Ruto’s not just shaking hands—he’s clutching on Raila like a lifeline. But will the lifeline hold until 2027, or will Gen Z deliver the final rites? Kenyans stay tuned for this Netflix blockbuster series.",Kenya,designkenyanstar,2025-03-07 16:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1j5snhl/the_affordable_handshake_will_rutos_dalliance/,8,2,kenya foreign aid
Kenyan social media app ??,"This came to mind this morning in the shower so may just be nonsense but why don’t we have our own social media app, developed by us and for us. 

We seem to only be using foreign social media apps which is fine but I think as a people, especially given we are a tech hub or one of the tech hubs in Africa, we should at least have a social media app. 

I’m sure there are many skilled tech people in Kenya with enough dedication, bringing together of their resources (even if small) can create something that is our own online space. 

It could be so cool, and a great place for us as Kenyans to mobilise without foreign opinions, if we needed. 

I think our top tech wizards, need to get cracking to be honest. And it doesn’t even need to be as big as instagram or TikTok but just something for us Kenyans, and maybe other East Africans in the future?

🚨 PUBLIC NOTICE: BEWARE OF FRAUD – WAKILI OMBACHI BRIAN MOMANYI & INFINITE HORIZONS LTD,"🚨 PUBLIC NOTICE: BEWARE OF FRAUD – WAKILI OMBACHI BRIAN MOMANYI & INFINITE HORIZONS LTD

I am writing this to warn the public about a fraudulent scheme involving Wakili Ombachi Brian Momanyi and his company, Infinite Horizons Ltd, based at Total Energies, Ruaraka, opposite Safari Park Hotel, Thika Road, Suite F17, Nairobi, Kenya.

On 14th September 2024, I was introduced to Wakili Ombachi Brian Momanyi by John Wanguru at his office. He assured me that he would facilitate my Kenyan Foreigners’ ID and business permits for a total cost of KES 348,000. Based on this agreement, I made the following payments:

✅ KES 160,000 (cash) on 18th September 2024, withdrawn together at MPESA agent till 090010, Citadel Cellular Comms, Thika Road Mall (MPESA transaction: SIO2OTZ561).

✅ KES 140,000 (cash) on 25th September 2024, handed over at Maziwa Heights Apartments.

✅ KES 5,000 (MPESA) on 23rd September 2024 (MPESA transaction: SINOL9TAJW).

✅ KES 43,000 (MPESA) on 14th September 2024, sent to Infinite Horizons Tours and Travel bank account (NCBA Pay Bill 880100) (MPESA transaction: SIE3JU80IN).

This totals KES 348,000, which he acknowledged verbally. However, when I followed up on the progress of my Foreigners’ ID application, he only acknowledged receiving KES 43,000 and denied receiving the remaining KES 305,000, despite clear evidence of these transactions.

Upon demanding a refund of at least KES 48,000 in alleged overcharges, he has failed to comply.

WARNING TO THE PUBLIC

If you are considering engaging Wakili Ombachi Brian Momanyi or Infinite Horizons Ltd, BEWARE. This is a clear case of fraud and misrepresentation. I am in the process of filing formal complaints with:
⚠️ Law Society of Kenya (LSK) – Seeking his disbarment.
⚠️ Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) – Reporting for fraud.
⚠️ Kenya Police (CID) – Filing for criminal prosecution.

If you have also been scammed by him, I encourage you to come forward and report him to the relevant authorities. Let’s hold fraudsters accountable and protect others from falling victim.

TO WAKILI OMBACHI BRIAN MOMANYI

You still have the opportunity to refund the full amount immediately before legal action escalates.

Foreign policy under kasongo,"Kenya's diplomatic standing is taking hit after hit. This continent has fought too hard, for too long, to free itself from the grip of colonial powers, to stand on its own, to decide its own future. And yet in the middle of that struggle, must go's regime drags us backwards.

Look at the mess in Goma. The M23 crisis is a serious issue, one that needs African solutions. Instead, Must go brings in Macron, like someone incapable of reading the room. France, whose colonial grip on Africa is barely loosening, whose influence so many African nations are actively rejecting. Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, even Ivory Coast are kicking them out and here we are, inviting them in? That’s not leadership. That’s regression.

Then there’s the AU elections disaster. They show up with 100 MPs, making a scene, trying to strong-arm our way into a position we clearly hadn’t secured. And when Raila loses, some of the MPigs throw a fit, calling for Kenya to pull out of the AU? How do we claim to stand for African unity while acting like we’re above the very institutions meant to bring us together? This is the kind of arrogance that divides the continent, that weakens us.

And the worst of it, hosting the RSF at KICC. The same RSF that’s committing war crimes in Sudan, the same RSF that’s accused of ethnic cleansing, backed by foreign powers exploiting Africa’s conflicts. By giving them legitimacy, we’re not just tainting our name, we're signaling to the world that we’re willing to play host to warlords. What happened to Kenya’s moral high ground?

This isn’t just bad policy, it’s betrayal. History will not remember us kindly. Slowly, through bad decisions, alliances with the wrong people and short-sighted foreign policy. And once that reputation is gone, rebuilding it won’t be easy.",Kenya,iamkharri,2025-02-18 11:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1isaglm/foreign_policy_under_kasongo/,11,35,kenya foreign aid

Controversial post,"I see so much by Kenyans recently ranting about so called passport bros and foreigners here. It seems to be mostly Kenyan men complaining about Kenyan women being interested in them.

I believe it’s more about the attitudes here towards women by Kenyan men that has caused it.

In Europe, it’s illegal to wolf whistle at a woman when she walks by, you can’t beat her, she has as much rights in the workplace as a man. It’s illegal to sexually exploit women at work just so she can get a job. Women are mostly respected in a relationship, and we work hard to bring home high incomes. 

If Kenyan men started treating their women better instead of seeing them as lesser than they are (generally speaking) maybe they would stop looking for love outside of Kenya. 

Fact is that in long term relationships we often provide a better quality of life, and it’s not just income. We respect women more. We know the importance of romance and let women be free to choose to be a housewife or career woman. Change your attitudes towards life and stop blaming others when it doesn’t go the way you want.

Nobody handed us the opportunities we have here, we had to prove that we deserved them as by Kenyan law a foreigner cannot be hired if a Kenyan can do the job.",Kenya,Charming_Mzungu,2025-02-16 06:32:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iqm6yt/controversial_post/,0,47,kenya foreign aid
It's time we are honest to ourselves about Kenya's standing on the continent,"I made a post earlier on what to do to increase our International standings because let's be honest, we are kidding ourselves those are two AUC elections we have lost, no country which claims to be a major player on the continent will lose two elections, Domestic politics aside, this shows how extremely weak we are in the continent and it's largely due to Kenya's lukewarm foreign policy, several cases come to mind  

A few years ago the Israeli ambassador was publicly kicked out of the AU meeting in Addis Ababa at the request of Algeria and South Africa, that was even before the war in Gaza broke out. When the war in Gaza broke out ,what did Kenya do? Release the usual BS statements of neutrality it always does and it's still doing 15 months later, it abstains in UN votes, even went ahead to condemn the Houthis and hasn't joined in any of the international actions including in the ICC and ICJ of which it is a member, needless to say this does not bode well with the North Africans.

DRC,  instead of taking a firm stance and calling out Rwanda's actions, Kenya is just releasing neutral statements that say nothing really in as many words. In S.Sudan with it's current government crisis, what has Kenya done? Again nothing...in Somalia when the government of Hassan Sheikh Mohammed (which Kenya recognises) had a dispute with Jubaland, Kenya responded with the same usual BS statements, I mean. Then there are the abductions of the Turkish exiles and Kizza Besigye ,such behaviours really affect a country's prestige.

If you want to be a regional and continental player, you have to start acting like one and you don't do that while sitting on the fence and you must be prepared to walk the talk ,South Africa isn't afraid to call out Israel for example is because they don't rely on it for it's security and defense industry, it has already developed a very robust one ,indeed it's the only African country that sells arms to the Americans. Kenya had to go against it's principles in order to secure Turkish drones (by deporting the Turks), needless to say if we made our own drones  we wouldn't have to do that. In short you don't become a key player in international politics if you don't have the capability to say F**k U, and that's what we should work towards or abandon all hopes of becoming any international player.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-02-15 15:41:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iq40e3/its_time_we_are_honest_to_ourselves_about_kenyas/,48,49,kenya foreign aid
Unpopular opinion,"Kenya will never be a regional or continental player if all we do is take neutral stances on everything and release lukewarm statements on happenings in the continent and region. Kenya of course does this to avoid bearing any cost, but you can't be any power geopolitically if you aren't willing to spend , you must be willing to spend heavily on your military, diplomatic missions ,intelligence services, infrastructure (that would enable you to host various summits)  and outreach programmes e.g sending doctors, relief aid, teachers etc to conflict and distressed areas ,eg Kenya should be having a fully functioning hospital (level 4 type) in DRC and Sudan (on your own dime).

For us to be able to afford this we have to have a robust economy,  you don't become a regional power with an economy of 120 bn usd just because your neighbours have 50 bn usd economies...I mean you are ahead but still crap.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-02-15 12:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iq0aar/unpopular_opinion/,16,19,kenya foreign aid

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama.

This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Trump/ The Republicans are not guessing he is implementing Project 2025,"Project 2025 is a political plan developed by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in the United States, to prepare for a potential Republican administration in 2025. 

It is essentially a blueprint for how a new conservative president could reshape the U.S. government.  

The plan focuses on four main pillars:  

1. Policy Agenda – It outlines conservative policies for major government agencies, including reducing government regulations, cutting welfare programs, and increasing executive power. 

2. Personnel – It aims to recruit and train conservative individuals to fill key government positions, ensuring the administration aligns with their ideology.  

3. Training Academy – It includes an online education program to train appointees on how to implement conservative governance.  

4. Transition Plans – It provides a detailed strategy to quickly implement these policies as soon as a Republican president takes office.  

For Kenya, Project 2025 might is  relevant in terms of U.S. foreign policy, as it proposes changes to how America engages with international organizations, aid programs, and global trade.

GPT Roasts Kenya,"I asked GPT to roast Kenya. It is very accurate. 

1. Kenya Power – The Ultimate Villain

KPLC doesn’t discriminate—rich, poor, middle class, if they decide you don’t need electricity, you don’t need electricity. It’s like they hold national meetings just to decide which town gets plunged into darkness next.

2. Safari? More Like Suffer-i

Kenya is known worldwide for safaris, but let’s be honest—unless you’re a tourist paying in dollars, that experience is for the mzunga na matajiri (foreigners and the rich). Locals get to see a warthog on Mombasa Road and call it a day.

3. ""We Shall Fix This Economy!""

Every election season, politicians come with fresh promises to fix the economy. Fast forward a few months, and suddenly, the only thing getting fixed is their bank accounts.

4. Road Construction—A Lifetime Project

A road that started in 2010 is still ""under construction"" in 2025. Meanwhile, the Chinese built a whole railway in 3 years. Priorities?

5. Hustlers vs. Dynasties

Kenyan politics is just a soap opera starring two families that have been in power since independence. Every five years, they pretend to be fighting, but after elections, they're all eating nyama choma together.

6. Nairobi Rent – A Crime Scene

How is rent in Nairobi so high? Landlords act like their single-room apartments come with Wi-Fi, gold-plated taps, and an expressway to heaven.

7. The National Anthem of Nairobi – “Hustle!”

From the shoe shiner to the Uber driver, to the guy selling power banks at the roundabout—everybody in Nairobi is on a grind. Sleep? That's a luxury only the government enjoys.

8. Bank Loans – Quick to Take, Impossible to Repay

A Kenyan bank will approve your loan in minutes but if you miss a single payment, your name will be in CRB faster than you can say ""nilikuwa na shida kidogo.""

9. Government Offices – A Masterclass in Patience

Need an ID, passport, or birth certificate? Get ready for a 3-month pilgrimage. Huduma Namba was supposed to fix things, but at this point, we might get to Mars before the system works.

10. Kenyans & Tribalism – United Online, Divided at Elections

On Twitter, we are all ""One Kenya, One People."" Come election time, suddenly we’re reminding each other which tribe our great-great-grandfathers came from.

Kenya, you stress us, but we still love you! Should I keep going?

Interesting report on what's limiting African growth and development,"It points to market frictions; a lack of regional integration and credit; declining foreign investment; and limited infrastructure and electricity supply while mentioning Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, and a few other bright spots.

Overall, I think it did a decent job of providing an overview of African growth and development, with implications both for business and policy. However, I wish it spoke more to trade (both within and beyond the continent). And I wish it also had an article on differences between various countries in Africa.

Even though I am not a regular Economist reader, I very much enjoyed reading this report because of my interest in Africa.

Does this report ring true for Kenya as well? Anything to add? I'd love to hear people's opinions.

Why is it that literally anyone can enter Kenya and obtain an ID/birth certificate as long as they 'pay something'? I have nothing against them, but this issue has to be controlled, especially with Somalis. They might probably be second to Kikuyus come next census, and it's quite alarming to the indigenous Kenyan communities. It's not just them but also Nigerians, Ugandans, Ethiopians, etc. Do you think controlling the border will benefit us in terms of job opportunities? I honestly think so.

"If God is all-powerful, He cannot be all-good. And if He's all-good then He cannot be all-powerful","I heard this quote in 2016's Batman vs Superman. I was about 14 years old, a Christian like my parents. I dismissed it as blasphemous and didn't think about it much after that. But over the years, personal and geopolitical events have pushed me to examine spirituality through theological, logical, and historical lenses. I turn 22 this year and now I’m an atheist. This quote resonates with me in a way I never imagined it could.

**The DRC**

In Goma, a church was bombed less than a week ago. Yet, it barely made a blip in international media. The tragedy was just another drop in the ocean of atrocities. A Congolese national on TikTok shared a video of his team delivering aid when a bomb landed just meters away. You can hear the gunshots in the background as they scrambled for safety. In the same video, a woman and her young child calmly narrate the bombing like it’s just another day. Children are trafficked and enslaved to mine the cobalt and coltan that power our smartphones and electric cars. They die in suffocating pits, crushed under collapsing earth. The ones who survive often endure daily abuse, starvation, and diseases no child should ever face. I could give you the statistics but we have been desensitized so that occurrence was the grunge reality of those on the ground. Ponder on it. Then go amplify [Pappy Orion TikTok's page](https://www.tiktok.com/@pappyorion) as he shares with the world the grim reality of those on the ground.

**Palestine**

The following are videos I've seen with my own eyes: A child sits in the rubble of their destroyed home, shaking uncontrollably, panicking, frantically looking for a place to hide as planes pass overhead. A man holds up a half-mutilated body of a child, missing parts from the torso down and flesh hanging off the place of severance. A father, holding the birth certificates of his newborn twins, weeps uncontrollably. They were killed in an airstrike while he was out running errands. A boy stares into the distance with a blank, emotionless face; his entire family is gone. How do you console a child whose world was obliterated in seconds? How do you justify children dying from heart attacks because they’re so paralyzed with fear? [The story of 5 year old Hind Rajab is just devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i9099v/the_story_of_hind_rajab/). But instead of universal outrage, we hear excuses. *""Shouldn’t have started a war you can’t win,""* they say. As if that justifies killing children. As if those children were combatants instead of victims. And to those claiming *""It started on October 7th,""* where were you when children were being humiliated, harassed, and terrorized by idf soldiers years before? This isn’t about land anymore. It’s about the inhumanity of it all. And if your reaction is to pick a side instead of mourning the dead, I don’t know what to tell you.

**Sudan**

The UAE has provided funding, logistics, and military equipment under the guise of securing its economic interests. Reports show that weapons and ammunition have been covertly supplied to the RSF, even as UAE denies involvement. Humanitarian aid shipments have been revealed as covers for arms transfers, and recent investigations by US lawmakers confirmed ongoing support from the UAE despite its official denials. Now over 10.2 million people displaced. More than 750,000 people on the brink of starvation. Entire communities wiped out as the RSF slaughters civilians with impunity, committing acts of genocide that shock even those hardened by years of conflict. Families, already living in desperate conditions, are left with no choice but to flee. Refugee camps swell with starving, sick, and traumatized survivors who may never see justice.

**Unequal Attention**

What breaks me most is how unequal the coverage is. It was easier to find the details of Palestinian atrocities than it was for Sudanese or Congolese ones. And I say this as an African. My own people, my brothers and sisters, are so overlooked that their suffering isn’t even documented properly. The media relegates African atrocities to footnotes, treating them as less significant than others. The world cries for Ukraine or Gaza, and they should, but where are those same voices for Sudan and the DRC? The silence is deafening.

**Theological Reflection**

I’m sick of hearing people try to explain this away. Whether in the DRC, Sudan or Gaza, the suffering is not part of some mysterious, divine plan. If God exists and allows this, He isn’t good. If He wants to stop it but can’t, He isn’t powerful. Claiming He’s all-loving in the face of these horrors is an insult to every victim’s memory. Spare me the debates about free will or 'God works in mysterious ways.' There is no justification for this. No excuse for letting innocent children suffer, for letting entire families and communities be destroyed. If your God loves you, fine. But don’t call Him all-loving, because His actions (and lack thereof) don't reflect that.

**Historical Atrocities in the Name of God**

This isn’t a modern problem. Religion has justified horrors for centuries. The Crusades left rivers of blood in their wake. Colonialism destroyed entire continents. In Africa, missionaries came with Bibles in hand, preaching salvation while stealing land and stripping people of their culture. In the Americas, conquistadors slaughtered Indigenous people in the name of Christ. One Native American chief, before being executed by the Spanish, said, *""I do not want to go to heaven if that’s where the Spanish are.""* Can you blame him? Heaven was a place for the colonizers; a paradise for murderers who brought nothing but death and destruction. If that’s God’s plan, I want no part of it",Kenya,Current-Olive-6530,2025-01-24 18:23:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i926d9/if_god_is_allpowerful_he_cannot_be_allgood_and_if/,7,11,kenya foreign aid

Advice for woman considering security guard jobs in Canada -- scams?,"I'm an American currently staying at a conservancy in Kenya, and one of the rangers has been asking me for advice about her plan to move to Ontario Canada to take a job as a security guard.  This immediately raised questions in my mind because I know the Canadian immigration system requires employers to prove that there is no citizen who will take the job before allowing hiring of foreigners.  I also have read articles about scammers in developing countries including Kenya scamming and cheating job applicants.  On the other hand, I did find one online article that said that there is a need for security guards in Ontario.  I asked if she has talked to people currently in Canada who have done this job and it doesn't sound like she has, which concerns me. 

Does anyone have advice I can share with her?  Specifically, (1) how to ensure that the recruiter is legitimate (2) any contacts of Kenyans currently doing this sort of work in Canada who may be able to advise her (3) Any other advice I can give her?

African Self-esteem,"I didn't know how to term this but...

Is it only me that whenever I am searching for anything intellectually incluned that relates to me as a Kenyan, be it a research topic and papers, philosophy, religion, history, a medical condition or symptoms and it's medication, social topics like marriage and relationshis, reviews on a wide array of products i.e tech products, cosmetics, medicine, travel destinations, food and nutrition, I always find myself searching first from African professionals, researchers, revieweres, travel vloggers and bloggers, journalists etc. before venturing out to see what the West thinks?

And this comes second to nature subconsciously. I asked around from friends and they honestly don't care much and it got me thinking if I am alone.

There is so much disinformation out there about so many issues affecting and surrounding the African being down to our anatomy that I think always using western blanket impositions is dangerous especially in attaining the African Pan-Africanism we all aspire to. Just imagine Kenya and Africa outside the lenses of Neocolonialism. A pipe dream maybe but surely not far fetched if we intentionally choose to be fully self reliant and sufficient by continuing to champion and funding Research cognitive to Africans, encourage literature and arts by documenting our unique lives, redefining oir history and championing it for a better future for ourselves and weaning ourselves off the culture of outside reliance.",Kenya,Either_Letterhead_39,2025-06-17 08:46:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ldi2ul/african_selfesteem/,6,4,usaid kenya funding cut
A Dramatic Journey from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam ( My encounter with Tanzanian highway police at night),"I had always had a keen interest in traveling to Tanzania (especially it's largest city Dar). I have a keen interest on living minimally and backpacking all over the world.

 Tanzania was my tester, so an opportunity came when I connected with my campus buddy who had film projects there and was living in Dar. He invited me and since I was working online at the time,I took the opportunity. I went to river road and booked a bus, I was in a hurry,  so when I was told Tahmeed busses were full for the next day, I insisted on looking for another company (I was desperate to go) river road being river road some guy at the Tahmeed booking office connected me to another guy. This guy went with me in some streets and we found another bus company (Trinity company) I hurriedly booked the ticket. 

The guy told me I call him before I came in the morning.  So morning came, nikafika tao ma 5am. Maze kucall uyo guy,alicome yes,bana kumbe that company haiendangi Dar alikuwa ananiuza kwa company ingine,I think ya tourist wanatoka Jiji hadi Arusha, I  remember I sat with a pregnant Burundian woman ( lafudhi yake ya kiswahili ilikuwa funny) she complained alot about her expirience at the boder while entering kenya from Uganda.

 That morning before Nitoke  kejani,nilikuwa nimevuruta Wajakoya ndio ni meditate kwa io journey.So the woman talking nilikuwa tu na medi akifikiri namskiza. We reached Namanga and it was all smooth. Maze kufika Arusha it was  the end of the journey ya io basi and tuli have kuuzwa kwa ingine. Now the second bus nilipandishwa ilikuwa zile buses  kama Mbukinya but ya uko sasa.The Nairobi guy took like 5k from me najua alikula cut big, ningepandishwa tu a decent bus from Arusha to Dar. 

Night came and we started the journey.  The bus was full A.F. Na io journey ni mbali msee like mbaali bana. Guys sat even chini bana. It was this coster buses that come from China ,kama daladala zao, my seat was apo kwa malango where the makanga seats like neighbour ya io seat. Ma giz giz tunaenda hatufiki, since jaba is illegal uko, dere na makanga walikuwa wanatema taxin kwa paper ma njege wakiwa on sight then wanarudisha tukiendelea. 
Just past Moshi, we were stopped  by police for the second time,Dere aka arifu makanga ateme ""mirungi"" as they call jaba there. I was kinda sleepy but vile nilisikia dere  akiwarn makanga nika amka. A police officer in white uniform like the Salvàion Army church members entered the bus . He looked around, na I think since mimi ndio nilikiwa nimevaa mavin solo nikasikia "" wewe,njoo nje"" , You know I was like Tf inside my mind.. the police continued by saying "" chukua begi lako pia"" I had my laptop bag on my laps. So I followed the cop. We went behind the bus. Some cop akanimulika kwa uso kiutiaji kama kawaida ya macop ma  ufala tu,you know them..

 Then he said shouted in kiswahili  , "" afande uyu si MTanzania"" ule mwingine alikuwa kwa gari akasema "" kama hana stakabadhi ,piga simu!!""  by now, around three cops were around me, the one questioning me asked, ""unastabadhi?"" I said ndio, I opened my bag and one of the cops took my bag as the other one was provided light with their torch. They checked my bag and I removed my passports and the yellow fiver book,  after that they told me "" toa kofia"" then they started laughing. Izi njege zikaanza kunifwananisha na footballer wao fulani,

 I think my jumper was still having the aroma of Wajakoya, they asked, "" wewe unatumia sigara gani"" tell me without fear I said, bangi , ""lakini natumia Kenya sio uku,"" they didn't bother ( apparently jaba is prohibited than sigara mrefu) after that they told  me "" weka stakabadhi zako pahali tofauti tofauti ndio zisije zikaibiwa zote"".  Before they release me back to the bus they asked, "" unaenda kufanya nini Dar"" I told them kuona msela wangu, and they just told me to get in the bus, this was like 3 am.. I am telling you mi hujiuliza mbona niliwaambia navuta bangi ....... anyways

Incubators- The Infamous Startup Support Racket,"Anyone else notice there’s a whole swarm of these *“training-first, funding-maybe”* programs targeting African startups? Especially here in Kenya?

Every other year, there’s some new incubator or accelerator dropping flashy ads promising mentorship, exposure, networking, “access to capital”... the usual dream.

But then you visit their website — and the first thing you see is a price tag.

>KES 15,000 to attend our Founders Bootcamp

Bro? Excuse me?? You want founders — the people already broke, already hustling, already building — to *pay you* to teach them how to be founders?

Make it make sense.  
They’re literally selling *the idea* of being a founder back to the people who are already doing it. 😭

It’s like walking into a hospital with a bleeding arm and they say, *“Sure, but first, pay for this course on how to be a better patient.”*

These programs are out here monetizing the grind.  
Not funding founders — they're farming us.

I don't know how to title this ...,"I don't know if I've tittle this correctly but ...., I'll just write sometimes all you have is pen and paper and in my case a laptop ,Wi-Fi and reddit will do , lol.

I'm in my mid thirties for context. 2 years ago I embarked on a journey to create employment not only for myself but possibly for the people around me in my community and globally. A girl can dream right. My thought process was we consume a lot from the western world and all other areas of the globe but what do they consume from us directly? They have platforms and avenues where they can sell arts crafts and all kinds of creations straight from their backyards or garages and make really good money and sustain their livelihoods'. I was like you know what, we have all these hand crafted stuff that they pay top dollars for why cant we create platforms or channels  where our local artisans especially east Africans can market and sell their artifacts to the world and make their money ? 

I also had an idea to build a digital product one that defies borders, wipes them out completely and turns the world into a true global village, put real connections right at our fingertips. Just Imagine the infinite doors this could open mixing cultures blending Ideas people from totally different worlds working together with the possibility of creating honest income. A girl can dream. besides mobile money transfer originated from Africa, Kenya to be precise.

One thing about it that's not two, dreams need actions to actualize, to actualize one needs resources.  Resources can be monetary but in my journey I've come to realize resource is a heavy packed word. A roof over your head , a meal , health care , moral mental ,emotional support all are vital resources when it comes to building on as well as actualizing our dreams. For the past one year I've been running on fumes. last week Monday had to give up all my possessions for auction, the last thing I have to my name is my laptop. by end of day today I will be homeless as my landlady gave me notice to vacate .

I tried setting up a go fund me ... funny story the hoops and loops one has to go through smh. 

I tried UFANDAO guess what they expect you to give first to receive and you know what you cant donate to African causes literally. when you try you find you're blocked from donating to any African causes 

And then there's PayPal that treats receiving money in Africa like a conduit to funding terror groups or money laundering. Try creating [Paypal.me](http://Paypal.me) let me know how it goes if you're in Africa.

There's a chihuahua somewhere on these fundraiser platforms that's probably garnered over 10 thousand USD in donations while I have to pay for my fundraiser to go live ... diabolical. I don't have it but I somehow have to have it to get help I need to have it ? I'm confused lol. 

My mental health is probably in the dumpster somewhere, but lets assume that for now, if I ignore it long enough it probably wont exist.  

What am I saying ? dear Africa we have the capacity resources brains skilled labor  and everything else in-between to create a self sufficient continent. we let the western world take soo much from us while they give literally nothing back but religion and a dream that our riches are in heaven while actively enjoying our tangible resources to make their lives easier and better.

Anyone here using Alibaba to import goods into Kenya?,"Many Kenyans are turning to Alibaba to source products cheaply from China — things like electronics, clothes, kitchenware, and more. Whether for resale or personal use, the platform offers lower prices than local markets. But importing is not as easy as checking out online.

**Shipping:** You can choose air freight (fast but expensive), sea freight (cheaper but takes 30–40 days), or courier services like DHL (fast but very costly). Sea freight is more economical for bulk orders, but it needs patience and paperwork.

**Payments:** Alibaba offers Trade Assurance (like an escrow), which protects buyers until goods arrive. Alipay is another option, and recently, M-PESA started working with Alipay — which is a game-changer for small Kenyan buyers. Still, some suppliers prefer bank transfers, which feels risky for first-timers.

**Customs:** This part can be tricky. KRA charges VAT and import duties depending on what you’re bringing in. Some people have had shipments held because of unclear paperwork or surprise fees. Freight forwarders can help, but they also charge their cut.

Then there are risks: fake suppliers, poor-quality items, delays, and no recourse if you didn’t use Trade Assurance. Some people say it's worth it, others have horror stories.

So I’m curious — has anyone here successfully used Alibaba to import to Kenya? What were the challenges or wins? Any tips for shipping, payments, or avoiding scams?

Parent that has the financial ability but isn't being supportive...,"I've been raised as the only son. My dad actually has a good position in a very good company here in kenya. We even get free medical cover because of him being a staff in that company. He was employed when he was 19 years and he then went for higher learning and grew through the ranks until where he is today. 

When I was back home in a city in kenya, I wont mention, my neighbours used to think that I'm a rich man's son, and that I was pampered and all that. The truth is the only things I got from my dad were simple things. I can't even name a shoe or a clothe that he ever bought for me or anything. If I passed my exam, I was just told it's ok. Nothing happens. 

My dad just cared about paying school fees and anything that relates to it. Those other things, no. I remember there was a time when I was in std 6, he completely refused to buy me shoes. I was walking with completely torn up shoes. The shoes looked like they could talk to your friend and ruin his entire day. 

That day, I got so angry and I did the unspeakable. I took cement from the store and poured in his well polished shoes and went to school. I was never the troublesome kid. I was just that kid who was calm, passed exams and loved cartoons. I was like a role model to some kids. I was always the 'nice' kid.  I just did that out of anger. The kids of the father's who worked with my dad seemed to live good lives as compared to my pathetic life.

My dad actually owns a business, land, and rentals in two cities. The rest I don't know. He is also a drunkard. From when I was young I just avoided borrowing him money because he would never give me. I used to just borrow my mom and when she doesn't have, then I just understood because she has a small business. My dad is much superior to her financially.

We also don't pay rent because we live in my dad's property. Now, let me go to my main topic. I studied smart and ended up completing my degree. So I became one of the unemployed youths for sometime. Within a month I got a casual job. The casual job was a continuous one, 24/7 but I used to work at night.

So I was to stay alert at night and sleep during the day. The job paid averagely and I can't complain. It wasn't a hard job too. So it came to an end in December. From then, I was unemployed. I was doing every kind of gig and every kind of thing just not to go home. I reached a point where I was capable of illegal activities like fraud but I didn't do them. I fear DCI. By that time, I'd sometimes tell my dad nimelemewa but the old man just wanted me to go home.

I'd tell him that, and I'd have to disturb him for days only for him to send 150 kes. I just knew I was a partial orphan. So last month but 1, I told him I'd go back home because I had suffered enough. My friends told me to continue pushing and that some day things might get better. What gave me hope was the interviews I got. I used to walk to those interviews because I had no money. I mean long distance journeys.

There was a time I was very sick. I told my old man and he just told me to go to the hospital. I had no money and he didn't send any. I just told my mom and she sent 300 kes and told me to use it as transport and in case of anything I should call her. My dad went ghost mode and called me after a week, only to send me 500 kes. He just asked if I'm ok and I said no and that's what he did.

Today, what broke my heart was how he responded to my call. I'm his only son so I really don't know why he just acts like I'm not human or what. I got a job on Tuesday. A casual one. But, the fare is 80 kes. I mean 80 kes in the evening and 80 kes in the morning. I work at night.

I just called him since I know it's that time that they've already been paid. I told him to only send me fare to go to work today. I also told him that I had not paid last month's rent and the landlord is on my neck. You know what he said? I know you've already guessed right. 

He was like, "" 'James' (not my real name) hebu omba mama yako. Mimi sina pesa kabisaa"". Then I told him that I had borrowed my mom countless times. I have even taken loans from my friends and even the banks, and fuliza but he just said, ""mimi sina pesa. Kopa mama yako alafu umwambie utamlipa"". I just heard that and cut the phone. 

You can also imagine that he has blocked me in all his numbers except one. If he blocks that one number then I'll never be able to contact him again.

I'm just feeling so low. When will life go my way. I don't remember a day that I had a decent meal. You can also imagine I'm a casual worker and it's not that easy when you're not eating well. I'm so tired and maybe I was just born into the wrong family. I just wish I can get that fare before evening because not going to work is also depressing.

I swear I'll never let my children experience this. I'll support them till they get financially stable. I'll do that shamelessly. ",Kenya,Chainzzz1543,2025-06-01 05:21:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0h5jg/parent_that_has_the_financial_ability_but_isnt/,25,49,usaid kenya funding cut

Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!. A continuation of the 1970's and 1980's second crisis of Economic theory between the two Cambridges.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2. Methodology from https://dsbb.imf.org/e-gdds/dqaf-base/country/KEN/category/NAG00. **FYI** You can calculate GDP via 3 approaches - **Income**(sources of funds), **Expenditure**(uses of funds) & **Output**(production of goods/services). To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Give your sons inheritance.,"
I’m a misogynist because of my mum. It’s from her that I learnt phrases like 🚨 “a woman is not your friend”, “make money because women disrespect men without money ”, “kazi yako ndio mke wako wa kwanza.”
 
She also gave me my first two acres 💰 even without asking. What made the whole thing special 💐 was that she had inherited the land from her mum and she directly gave me the same land—something many African/Luhya women would never do.

She of course took me to private schools 🏫 both primary and university to ensure that I get the best. She ensured that when I was applying for my passport that I’d get it fast 💨 so that I could travel 🧳 easily. She is the reason I have very high standards.

My 🤩 mum empowered me because she is a woman and she knows what women are capable of.
She understood that it’s only with such moves that she’d ensure my financial stability as well as freedom from both my sisters and any other woman 👩‍🦱.

Here is to the mums in this group: empower your sons—after all, you know what your fellow women can do and you have examples of that. 

And kudos to my 🫡 mum for setting up the bar.

Edit: this post is sarcastic and from the looks of it it went over many peoples head. why do we need to have gender wars based on other people actions yes there are bad men and women out here but there are also good men and women just choose wisely, respect yourself and have boundaries, if somebody crosses be ready to cut them off .

The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

Amazing scientific facts,"Leo wacha tuongelee astrophysics. The speed of light is the fastest thing in the universe.light travels at almost 300,000 kilometers a second, so this means that if you were in a spaceship moving at that speed you could circle the Earth nearly eight times in just a second. what's even crazier is at this speed you could get to the moon in just 1.3 seconds or even Mars in just three minutes even with it being roughly 55 million kilometers away. what if you want it to cross the whole Milky Way?  it would take an insane 200,000 years at that speed to cross its entire length . on top of that if you wanted to travel beyond our galaxy and to our closest neighbor Andromeda Galaxy this would take you  two and a half million years and if you tried visiting the edge of the observable universe you would never arrive since the universe is expanding faster than light itself.

"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/s/CuhrvCiGh5

95% percent of you told me that I didn't and that I did just fine. Let me give you an update 💀

So not so long ago, we met up and chilled. But I could sense something was off. Usually the moment we sit down, he's all over me giving me cuddles and all that. But this time? He just sat down arms to himself. I asked him what was on his mind and he said nothing much. In my head I was like hmm okay maybe he's just having one of those days. Anyway a couple days after our meet up I get the infamous ""we need to talk"" text. 

I call him the moment I see it but he had fallen asleep. Now I was shitting myself the entire night because I'm overthinking everything. I manage to get 2 hours of sleep. This man calls me in the morning and basically tells me that he's realised he only had lust for me and not love. Alex wtf?😂 I could never have guessed. Everything was going so well. At least from my perspective. He then says that the day we we met up, it just confirmed everything for him. 

I'm not the type to chase someone if they're breaking up with me. I don't ask a million questions and cry for a second chance. I simply just said okay, have a nice day and proceeded to block him on absolutely everything. Anyway, this is not to discourage my fellow girlies from asking guys out. Be my guest 😂😂 but for me? 

If this is how the first time I ask a guy out turns out, I will NEVAAH do such a thing again. Eh, but I loved him😭 I even bought us matching outfits😭 I must burn them. I gave him my favourite panties. I want them back😭

But on a serious note, being told by someone you love that they only have lust for you cuts deep. Cause all my feelings were genuine on my side. This is the same man who said I love you first and that whatever happens we're always going to tackle the problem together. But anyway I'm doing alright. I'm healing.

UON Conned,"ICYMI..

EXCLUSIVE: How an Impostor Brought Kenya’s Premier University to Its Knees
The Curious Case of Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo – The Man Who Staged a Real-Life Thriller at the University of Nairobi
By Investigative Desk
 
If you thought Joshua Waiganjo—the man who posed as a senior police officer—was Kenya’s greatest impostor, think again. A new king of deception has emerged, and his theatre was not a remote police post, but the highest citadel of intellectualism in Kenya: the University of Nairobi (UoN). Meet Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo—a man whose mastery of lies, manipulation, and coercion reads like a Hollywood political thriller. From masquerading as a Catholic priest, senior intelligent [couldn't pronounce it well-how he'd scare people with!] officer to an international fund raiser!
This week, Ouma was finally unmasked and arraigned in court, facing charges of abuse of office, academic fraud, and the unlawful acquisition of over KES 32 million from public coffers. His arrest by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alongside senior Council members of UoN sent shockwaves across Kenya’s academic and governance sectors.
But who is Brian Ouma?
He was once a driver—yes, a driver—assigned to Chancellor Dr Vijoo Rattansi. He swindle d peopke by posing as Rattansi's PA cum bodyguard.But from those humble beginnings, Ouma’s ambitions knew no bounds. He is alleged to have forged academic documents, including an MBA certificate from a reputable university, and used them to armtwist top university official to secure top-level positions at UoN. It is only Prof. Magoha who doubted Ouma's papers and denied him a job. Prof. Magoha saw no peace as Education Cabinet Secretary until he was shiwn the door. Ouma is rumoured to have swore that Prof Magoha would never find peace, and true to hus word, Prof Magoha's attempt to become an Emeritus Professor at UoN were thwarted by Ouma! To ascend to what he referred as the 'table', Ouma manipulated University Council processes to rewrite governance structures, and eventually self-styled himself as The Chief Operations Officer (COO)—a role he created and appointed himself to. The university statutes do not have this position.
Insiders say he was so brazen that he drafted proposals to restructure the university’s governance system to weaken the Vice-Chancellor’s role and centralise all power under the COO—himself. His argument was thst a Vice-Chancellor need not be a Professor as their preview is in classrooms. At one point, he even plotted to become the Vice-Chancellor without holding a single recognised academic qualification. He would bypass the Ministry of Education, dismiss the role of the Cabinet Secretary as “cosmetic,” and advised the Council to unilaterally install his preferred Vice Chancellor!
Worse still, he allegedly  named in a scandal where he influenced the admission of unqualified students into the competitive Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Paediatrics programmes without merit. What began as fraud escalated into what could be considered educational sabotage. If true, this borders on criminal negligence—entrusting human lives to unqualified medics.
But that was not all.
Brian turned the university into his private estate. He sidelined directors, installed cronies, intimidated staff, and reportedly ran a parallel government within the institution. He filed dozens of court cases, paralysing UoN's operations and reforms. Over 400 cases are linked to his faction, turning the judiciary into his preferred tool of resistance.
He then ventured into tenderpreneurship, allegedly looting endowment funds meant for student scholarships and research. He broke deals over UoN land and dished out contracts like political favours.Any line officer who dared question his underhand deals would regret dearly. The infamous transfers of senior officers by the Council Chairman was as a result of the bad blood occasioned by Brian.Sources claim that Council members received “tokens of appreciation” to keep him in power. Council members who wouldn't toll the line are forced to resign or their appointments revoked.Through a network of enablers, he destroyed the careers of five Vice-Chancellors—Prof. Mbithi, Prof. Mbeche, Prof. Ogot, Prof. Ogeng’o, and Prof. Kiama—as well as countless administrators and technical staff who dared question his authority. The current hullabaloo at UoN is as a result of the current Vice-Chancellor refusing to give in to Ouma's demands.
The result? A once world-class university now faces over KES 13 billion in pending bills, crumbling infrastructure, and a deeply demoralised workforce. His reign pushed UoN into conflict with government, compromised its national reputation, and reversed decades of academic progress.
Brian Ouma is no ordinary impostor. He has an insatiable appetite for power. He did not stop at impersonation; he reimagined and rewrote the very fabric of governance at Kenya’s most iconic university—unchecked and unchallenged, until now.
As he now stands before the courts, Kenyans are left asking: How could the intellectual powerhouse of East Africa fall for such a man? And how many more “Brians” are hiding in our institutions?
For now, justice may finally be catching up with the man who made deception a job description. But the damage he has inflicted on UoN—and on public trust—may take years to undo.",Kenya,MbDocx,2025-05-21 05:27:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1krq5qu/uon_conned/,4,6,usaid kenya funding cut
Some reality check you might need...,"Marriage Isn’t a Love Story—It’s a Survival Test

Let’s destroy the fantasy:

Marriage isn’t magic. It’s maintenance.

There’s no Disney soundtrack. No soft fade into bliss. No credits rolling with smiles and sunset.

Marriage is a contract—with moving deadlines, unpaid invoices, and emotional overdrafts.

You don’t marry peace. You marry problems you’re willing to solve—forever.

Let’s talk real:

—

1. Two Become One? No—Two Collide Loudly

You’re a lion. She’s a swan. You want silence. She wants connection.

You thought merging identities was cute?

Wait till you realize she doesn’t rinse the blender after use. She leaves hair in the sink. She plays voice notes out loud at 6:30am.

This isn’t unity—it’s adjusted warfare.

And every day is a compromise.

Not a kiss.

—

2. There’s No Such Thing as “Financially Ready”

Waiting to be “stable” before marriage?

You’ll wait forever.

Even billionaires have bad quarters. Even CEOs face layoffs. Even trust fund babies have alimony battles.

The moment you marry, life hits: Hospital bills. Car repairs. Leaky roofs. Kid's braces.

The illusion of financial “readiness” is a trick to stall responsibility.

Money doesn’t protect marriage.

Discipline does.

—

3. In-Laws Are a Full-Time Obstacle Course

Her mom wants a say in your bedroom.

Her dad still thinks you’re not good enough.

Her sister hates you on principle.

And your own mother still wants you to “come home more often.”

Marriage isn’t two people.

It’s two tribes, two traumas, and two group chats you’ll want to leave every week.

Love her?

Get ready to survive her ecosystem.

—

4. Pregnancy Is a Bomb With a Beautiful Aftermath

No sleep. No sex. No peace. No schedule.

Her hormones are on a rollercoaster. Her back is screaming. Her moods shift like weather.

And you?

You’re expected to stay calm, supportive, rich, and romantic.

Pregnancy doesn’t just change her body. It rewires your entire life.

And if you're not emotionally grounded?

You’ll break while she’s blooming.

—

5. Even When It Works, You Still Get Children—A.K.A. Permanent Roommates That Scream

They don’t care about your meetings. They don’t care about your peace. They don’t care that you paid the rent.

They wake you up. Throw up on your suit. Ruin your dates. Hijack your bank account.

Kids are cute chaos.

And the “blessing” comes with at least 18 years of emotional financing.

—

6. “Forever” Is a Long Time to Share a Bathroom

You think you know her?

Wait 7 years.

Her interests shift. Her body changes. Her politics evolve. Her libido... retires early.

Marriage requires constant re-introductions.

Who she was at 27 will not be who she is at 37.

And if you’re not willing to love a thousand versions of the same person?

You’re not ready.

—

7. You’ll Forgive More Than You Ever Imagined—Or You’ll Break

She’ll say things that cut. She’ll do things that confuse. She’ll hurt you deeply—and still expect dinner.

And you?

You’ll have to swallow your ego, revisit your boundaries, and choose peace over pride more times than you thought possible.

Marriage is forgiveness on repeat.

And sometimes?

The hardest thing to heal... is loving someone who broke you.

—

8. Marriage Is a Business—One Lazy Partner Will Bankrupt the Whole Thing

It takes two investors to grow it.

But one reckless decision—one emotional tantrum, one cheating moment, one lazy stretch—and it’s over.

Marriage demands ROI: Time. Energy. Sacrifice. Forgiveness. Vision.

And if one partner’s asleep at the wheel?

You both crash.

—

Final Word: Everything Ends—In Death or Divorce. Prepare for Impact.

Don’t walk into marriage with cinema dreams and Instagram logic.

Walk in with clarity. Grit. Adaptability. Because this isn’t a fairy tale. It’s a fight.

And love doesn’t conquer all.

Sometimes?

Love dies quietly—in resentment, in routine, in unreconciled truths.

So brace yourself.

This isn’t “happily ever after.”

This is “grind together until the end—or fall apart trying.”

"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

•	When (and where) do you expect to retire?

Also, given our income levels, extended family responsibilities, and economic challenges, do you think FIRE is realistic in the Kenyan context?

Skills not scripts and papers.,"Yo, so yesterday I was at this high school AGM in my county, and I gotta say, i was frustrated 😔. They had this 70-year-old motivational speaker come through, and bro was spitting advice like we’re still stuck in the 20th century. 😭 I’m sitting there like, bruh, what is this?

First off, this dude had the audacity to tell students they shouldn’t even “touch” a phone at home during holidays or on visiting days at school. Like, excuse me? You’re telling my kid they can’t have a chatwith their siblings who couldn’t make it to see her? In 2025, when phones are basically our lifeline? That’s wild. Phones aren’t just for vibes; they’re how we stay connected.

Then, he drops this outdated gem: “Education is the *only* way to succeed.” Nah, fam, I would’ve stood up and asked, “Sir, you know how many Gen Zs are out here pushing Lambos and Teslas in their 20s, with no degree, and their net worth is clowning yours?” Like, let’s talk about the content creators, coders, and entrepreneurs who dropped out, leveled up their skills, and are now global. This man was flexing his 6-bedroom mansion like it’s the ultimate glow-up, and I’m like, *dawg, that’s cute, but Gen Zs are buying penthouses and crypto.* Oh, and he also bragged about traveling to *three* African countries. 😅 Meanwhile, we got 22-year-olds who’ve been to Dubai, the US, and Europe, funding it all with their hustle—no degree required.

Here’s the tea: skills > papers. The world’s moving fast, and these Gen X speakers are out of touch. They don’t get that our phones are our office, our studio, our *employer*. We’re out here building brands on TikTok, coding apps, and closing deals on X, while they’re still preaching “go to school, get a job.” Nah, we need millennials or Gen Zs to speak at these events people who actually get the game. Stop inviting folks who think a landline is cutting-edge to guide our generation. We’re not tryna hear it. #SkillsNotScripts

# How do we fix an education system where even the educators don’t know how to learn and are teaching kids garbage?

# And to the parents reading this: are you supporting your child’s growth, or just projecting your own academic trauma?

Anyway, now that I got your attention with the headline and the post, hold on before you smash that downvote or scroll past thinking this is just another rant. Hear me out first, ok? This post is about cutting through the noise and calling out uncomfortable truths nobody else dares to say loud because they'll be stoned to death. It’s not clickbait fluff or empty hot takes. If you want the facts and not bs then stay right here, piga upvote and open your eyes. If not, go ahead and keep sipping that ignorance tea while the rest of us move forward.

Let’s talk fellow Kenyans. Because I’m tired of the noise.

Everyone’s has been up in arms lately about CBC. Parents calling it “too much work,” teachers saying “we weren’t trained for this,” and some students whining about “too many projects.”. I'm gonna drop a bombshell none of you expected, today. In my humble opinion, most of these complaints aren’t about CBC being broken. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. STAY WITH ME HERE.

Rather, they’re about people being too deep-rooted in the outdated, compliance-based, brain-numbing mess that was 8-4-4. Now personally, I have never done 8-4-4, but some issues are obvious

I’ve been in education for over 20 years and counting. That’s not a typo.  
— 11 years of primary, junior high, and high school (Y1–Y11 equivalent)  
— 2 years of IAL  
— 6+ years of university for medicine  
— Then residency and specialization (cardiology? another 6 years minimum)

Ok, now that I've established where I lie, and show I am neutral and have no bias. Let me go on;

You want to know the truth? **CBC isn’t hard**—thinking is the issue. Most kids, esp Kenyans kids, due to the system, aren't taught to think in the old-kenyan system \[8-4-4\] other systems do.

You think British Curriculum kids whine when asked to do independent research or critical analysis in Year 9? You think an IB student breaks down when told to prepare a presentation or connect subjects across disciplines? You think CBSE learners get shocked when they’re expected to *understand*, not just *memorise*? No, they don't. Because they're taught critical thinking, analysis and creativity.

**Real education systems**, like what we're building rn, are the kind that produce students who can *adapt globally*, have been doing this for decades. CBC is finally trying to move Kenya into that space. And the resistance in question is coming from people who’ve been institutionalised by 8-4-4 so far in, they don't even know how to learn! It's crazy! That system trained people to only value marks, cram past papers, then flush it all out the moment exams end and say 'NIMEGRADUATE! IM SO DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL!' That’s why half the population treats education like a phase in their life rather than their foundations. This rarely happens globally, I currently live in the UK, yes, some students are like this, but most look back and are like 'fun days'. Here, it appears people almost dread education?

I’m still in the system, still learning. And *everything* CBC demands: self-teaching, project work, presentations, cross-topic thinking, personal initiative: is just standard. You can learn as a kid without a tutor. You don't need someone to be there on the board to write notes. Fuck it, when you get to higher education levels, you realize you don't even need notes! It’s what the rest of the world calls *school*. The parents calling it ""stress"" are mainly complaining because 8-4-4 coddled your mind into thinking learning only counts when it’s scribbled on a test paper.

The problem isn’t CBC. The problem is citizens got comfortable with a mediocre education system. Most were trained to perform, not understand the content. This is clearly evident ukienda mtaa. CBC is exposing that. It’s showing who can adapt and who’s just coasting. It’s showing which teachers can evolve and which ones have been using the same notes and calling it 'teaching' since 1997.

If you’re a student crying because you have to build a model or present research, understand this: **you are not being overworked, you are being educated**. Take it from me, or from anyone in higher education, they all wish they had an education like yours, or what's currently being implemented.

8-4-4 created a population that discards education the moment KCSE results drop. 'Fuck school' is not cool! CBC is trying to change that. And frankly, if it’s pissing me off that the lazy, the outdated, and the unprepared are ranting when things are finally going good. The first step to the nation is education!

Yes, the execution has flaws, but conceptually? CBC obliterates 8-4-4 10 times over. I'd argue, it is conceptually world-class, or close to that.

I’ll admit: **execution has had it's fair share of problems**.

The rollout was rushed, comms were trash/non-existant. Resources are uneven, especially in rural areas. There’s a gap between the design and infrastructure, but I'm sorry to say, but we have to let some things go. Some people have to die on the hill for others to get to the top. Would you rather have 100 students get quality education. and 10 miss out. or all 110 get mid education? It's not fair, but there has to be a sacrifice.

But a **trained teacher** complaining “I wasn’t taught this during my diploma” is wild asf to me. ou're not working in a vacuum-sealed lab where nothing changes. You're an educator. Your literal job is to *learn*, *relearn*, and *pass down understanding*. Saying “I wasn’t trained for CBC” is like an engineer saying “I wasn’t trained for AI” and expecting the field to freeze until they catch up. It’s unserious and unprofessional. If you ever told my kid that, I'm transferring them immediately!

The *content* of education changes. The *format* changes. The *tools* change. That’s the point. All global syllabi, for those of you who are familiar with it, change almost every 3 or 5years! The role of an educator is to act as a conduit for knowledge, not a gatekeeper for 'KCPE' since 2002. Be a real educator. If you can’t evolve, you shouldn’t be holding chalk.

Let me tell you a lil story: something that genuinely shook me when I was in Kenya. I was tutoring my nephew for a bit: kid's bright, curious, full of potential but how the old system had taught him to learn was LITERAL garbage. Every time I asked him *why* something worked, he’d stare blankly, he only knew how to regurgitate facts, not think about 'why?' 'how?'. Memorised notes, word-for-word, page after page.

He was obsessed with this idea that education = copying down chunks of text and cramming them till midnight. I had to step in. Took two months off everything else just to restructure his entire approach. Taught him how to *actually learn* and think. After that he started *enjoying* school. Actually *understanding* things. I, shouldn't have to do, what a teachers job should be! It's frustrating asf!

Here’s what that taught me:  
**Even the average teacher in Kenya doesn’t know how to learn.**

Let that sink in.

And I’m not talking about the ones who genuinely care and constantly update themselves. Shoutout to the real ones like Mr. Wafula—dude was a beast in class, knew how to spark minds and actually teach. We need more teachers like him.

If you're writing 100 pages of notes on the board every week and calling it teaching, you're a joke.  
If you're forcing cramming because you have no idea how to facilitate actual comprehension, you're a joke. If you're beating kids because your own insecurities get exposed when students ask questions you can’t answer, *you're a joke*.

Too many teachers are stuck in the cycle of copying, dictating, and punishing. No methodology, They expect students to adapt while they themselves remain static. If you are a teacher doing this! Get serious! Your decaying kid's future for your own selfish gains of a 'paycheck'

Let’s stop pretending the problem is CBC. The real problem is an education culture that punishes thinking and rewards cramming. CBC imo is trying to disrupt that and the resistance proves it’s needed more than ever.

Back to the end, same questions guys: I wanna hear your guys' takddes;

# Do you agree CBC is the way forward?

Some bad news for you,"I went to visit my parents and  with people my parents age, they like their news.

Now for one, Mimi I don't intentionally keep up with news. I get it from Tiktok and X. 

It's been a couple of hours of back to back news and here are things I didn't know.

1. There hasn't been a budget for vaccines for newborns. What??? What the actual fuck!? Thinking about how BCG needs to be administered like within the earlier weeks of life, what do you actually mean hakuna vaccines? And the ones who can't afford private hospitals, how will those babies live?

2. There is no budget for national exams. That one I knew but kitu sikujua, these morons (apologies, or not,  if you're part of the team) are launching a new system KEMIS to consolidate all education systems and learners and professionals, idk man do the research. And guess what, the system exists ni vile inaitwa NEMIS. Sounds familiar, huh? (SHIF/NHIF)

3. I won't even touch on the Sugar Mills, the budget cuts for  the education and health sectors, the state house budgets, the new MP salary increase. Yho nishukisheni.

4. There was an idiot on Citizen news this morning defending the presidency saying 200k jobs have been created. Where? And going abroad for work isn't it. Must I go to another country to get greener pastures? Why can't we empower our own people to build here? 

Liiiiiikeee all I see is damage that will take years to undo.

Eg Jana I was on the expressway and thinking, this structure will start earning Kenyans money in the 2050s, wtf!! 

This is definitely betrayal in the city juu kama we're living in Mstahiki Meya.

Anyways, may the force be with you all. Happy Friday ☺️

The Problem With GIRL MATH,"Today I write about women who have monetary standards they do not fund. I am very curious aboutout how that thought process works. 

Like your favorite hairstyle is something you cannot afford, and you are comfortable with always asking? You live in a house you do not pay rent for, and you call it yours? 

While I get that we have been socialized that men should provide,, I find it interesting that you can set standards you cannot afford.

We have seen women who have become homeless after a relationship ends, and  and we have seen women who were chased out of homes because they own nothing. 

I have interacted with a woman who would sabotage every job opportunity she got so she could stay at home and wait to be catered to. Me and my honesty couldn'teep quiet.

I told her to get a job and be a functioning member of society. She said she will not be in a relationship and still stress herself. Meanwhile,, she wasn't even a homemaker. See,, being a housewife is work and a contribution to humanity.It is actually one of the most demanding jobs;  she wasn't that .

She would ask for the world,, and a man would try to give her even when he was jobless. They would have conflicts,, and the dudedude would say it will get better when money comes.. She didnot love him,, and he was so in love. So he chasedd money and got so much more.  It ended in premium tears for both of them.

The truth about life is that relationships are about value. Look at families today; children are choosingg to cut parents off because the value is less than the stress,, and it will only get worse from here.

We talk about about women's's empowerment,, but we don't talk about where the line is between dependency and financial abuse.

Someone taking out out a loan to maintain you is financial abuse; someone buying you gifts to apologize for cheating is not love. Telling a man to finance you so you can be their girlfriend is financial abuse; he should do so because he loves you. 

There is a lot of bullshit you will entertain as a woman if you don't have choices; you might even start thinking you love him,, but do you?

A lot would change if women stopped looking at relationshipss as a source of livelihood. 

Baby girl,, if you had your own money,, you wouldn't date anyhow.That chronic dating thing you are doing is because you are trying to survive,, and you don't really love them. 

You jump from one relationship to another because you need rent, shopping,g, and fare.

That thing you call your type might even change once you don't depend on it to survive. 

Men complain that she changed after she got a job and started earning .

Today's question is, is that really why she changed? Have you considered that maybe she didn't like you; she liked what you could give her? Is it possible she changed because she now has choices, something she didn't have when she was depending fully on you?

Dating within your tax bracket is practical; it comes with respect and honesty. Yes relationships don't all work the same,but people who have nothing to lose will drag you to the depths of hell and feel nothing at all.

You see those independent women that the Internet likes to call names? Yes, those ones. The truth is they don't entertain bullshit just for upkeep. But you cannot relate; you would rather be treated like an afterthought as long as you get pocket change. May sense locate, may you want better for your children or even yourself .",Kenya,Several-Librarian817,2025-05-15 17:11:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kndn0d/the_problem_with_girl_math/,4,19,usaid kenya funding cut

We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

Recommendations for Trip to Kenya in December,"
Hi,

Me and my wife are planning to travel with our parents to Kenya in the first week of December. Our parents are around 60 with few back issues and wanted your recommendations on some of our questions. We are planning a 6 day trip to Amboseli - Lake Nakuru - Masai Mara.

1. Travel from Amboseli to Lake Nakuru is around 7 hrs. Would you recommend cutting Amboseli National Park from the trip and spend another day Masai Mara?

2. Our goal of going to Amboseli is to see Mt Kilimanjaro, but with the short rains, would we be able to see the mountain?

3. Our main interest is to see all the wildlife, are 3 game drives enough in Masai Mara or should we extend our stay?

4. How is December in general for game drives?

5. Do you recommend booking package from tour operators or from hotel?

Have the recent world occurrences exposed how much Islamists and Christians have been manipulated in equal measure?,"As a Kenya and Christian, I must say that I have come to understand Israel to be totally different from what I believed. Christians world wide have been effectively manipulated into believing in some kind of sacred relationship with modern day Israel. It's even crazy how we've been manipulated to into a responsibility of honouring these bloody killers and idol worshipers. I mean, these are people who literally setup a national ceremony for animal blood sacrifice. These are people who've created and funded terrorist groups that massacred fir decades, and are  currently beheading Christians in Syria. Like, we're supposed to worship 

It's safe to say this notion of sacred Israel is a result of not reading the bible properly. Because the modern day nation of Israel is NOT that of the bible. 

Looking at Islam world, the manipulation has been by Saudi, Qatar, UAE dictatorial theocracies. These scums sponsor the extremist Wahhabism ideology (the one Sheikh Makaburi had started in the coast) that preaches hatred and death to Islael, US and kafirs. They fund Wahhabism indoctrination cells outside their countries, including Middle East, Africa and Asia.

Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Thieves. Rotten.,"Kenya is full of thieves. No morals. Rotten to the core. 

Think about the last time you wanted to see good deeds from the government and people..how did it turn out? I see the general public complaining about what the government should and shouldn't do, yet they elected them. 

The general public complaining is full of unpaid loans in their folios because they want the lender to suffer - but they can't see that, they have to 'project' their anger.

The general public steals whenever theirs a chance, from building materials to hospitals, to public funds availed to them! 

Where is Kenya headed to? Kenya was in the same league with some very 'rich' countries right now, but corruption stinks it. Have you had a look at one of Kenya's international airports? Looks like a cow shed.

Private Equity Funds in Kenya,"You may not be aware, but many of our expenditures today benefit Private Equity (PE) funds. They are crowding into Kenya to get a piece of the pie. With our lax laws and poor regulation, these funds are having a field day.

PE funds now own or back Java, Naivas, Quickmart, Goodlife Pharmacies, and several private hospitals. We’re even considering PE funds for the Nairobi–Mombasa toll road.

We all know their endgame: high shareholder returns and flipping the business for a profit. It's no wonder Java has near-monthly price hikes. 

We’re gradually losing control of essential sectors to entities whose primary concern is not service or affordability but short-term financial gain. With limited public oversight, this trend will likely continue unchecked.

Most men nowadays are mentally weak.,"There is a trending story about a popular Kenyan couple. Men are defending the man using the simplistic reasoning that men budget for their affairs which I find ridiculous. These are the same men who complain that women nowadays are after money, which is not wrong but what do you expect when it is the only flex you have? I know there are men who will agree with me that affairs are expensive and time consuming. Trying to hide an affair is a lot of hard work and mental gymnastics, or maybe I am just an amateur. I have cheated emotionally on a girl, the girl I talked about in my post on Valentines, here is the link https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1im2hwi/my\_simp\_era\_valentine\_edition/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button. I don't know if that was cheating but after a certain incident I checked out of the relationship. When I asked for a break up, she wouldn't agree. At first, I tried my best to hide it, realized it was a lot of work and did it openly to push her away. We eventually broke up but for some other reason. From that experience, I learned that cheating was hard. Is that cheating since I had already withdrawn my commitment to her?

I find using an excuse like budgeting for affairs very simplistic. As a man, why are you even budgeting for affairs? That money could be put to better use. Donate to charity, sponsor a child through high school, save, buy stocks or appreciating assets, travel. The possibilities are endless. If you have to part with money to keep an affair alive you are down bad. It's worse when you have a wife or girlfriend. Also, what's up with all the infidelity? Don't you guys have self control. One thing I learned about being a man is that it is more about how you tame your sexual desires. Self control is the hallmark, the gold standard for masculinity. Plus it is the woman who is benefitting, not you. The only thing you get in exchange is a wet crack, nothing more. The woman on the other side is getting money to fund her lifestyle, if she clever enough, invest. You mean you would rather spend on her than your wife? 

Modern men are increasingly become weaker mentally and it is sad to see. I now understand why women are making better progress nowadays. These women are ruthless and very intelligent. They don't play with their money like men are doing.

"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

Why are we playing so safe?,"I recently came across a group of guys online building hardwares like keyboards; beautifully designed ones. Transparent bodies that show the internal wiring, custom keycaps, artistic builds using different materials. It wasn’t about mass production or getting rich, it was about passion. They were just playing with the craft, exploring it.

And it made me think about software, which is my space. You look outside Kenya and you see people building amazing tools:

Perplexity AI — just using open AI models and a bit of code to rethink how we search the web.

Arc and Zen Browsers — basically Chrome and Firefox underneath, but reimagined with a fresh, thoughtful design.

Fellow devs know Supabase, Planetscale, Neon DB — not revolutionary ideas, but polished tools built on existing open-source databases that solve real developer problems in elegant ways.


Over here, we mostly get another delivery app, another finance app, another ""AI girlfriend."" Even in fashion, it’s the same formula, slap a logo or quote on a blank tee and sell it as a brand. Everyone's chasing virality and “quick money,” but very few are building with care, with vision.

And it’s not just tech or fashion. In real estate, almost every property is either a high-rise apartment or a huge mansion. Nothing in between. No townhouses, no duplexes, no creative use of small spaces. Interiors are the same grey tiles, same wardrobes, same white lighting. It’s like we copied one Pinterest board and called it a day. There’s no personality in most of what we build anymore.

But I get it. People are in survival mode. Graduates want stability first. Manufacturing is hard. Logistics are unreliable. Funding is scarce. And the saddest part is that we don’t have a strong consumer culture that appreciates thoughtful, original work. So when someone actually tries to do something different, they’re often ignored, underpaid or burnt out.

This has a ripple effect. Music starts sounding the same. Apps solve the same problems. Homes all look alike. Fashion feels soulless.
And slowly, we lose our sense of wonder and our ability to imagine and build something just because it feels meaningful.

Maybe this post won’t fix anything. But maybe it resonates with someone. Because I know I’m not the only one who wants more. More soul. More play. More risk. More weird, beautiful ideas and more of the kind that make you feel something.

Anyone else feeling this?",Kenya,Current-Olive-6530,2025-04-12 02:51:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jx7itx/why_are_we_playing_so_safe/,49,20,usaid kenya funding cut
Sign the Petition to Declare Femicide a Crime in Kenya,"Why this petition matters


Started by Usikimye Kenya
Media inquiries
Every two days, a woman in Kenya is murdered simply because she is a woman.
This is not just another tragedy—this is femicide, the intentional killing of women because of their gender, rooted in deep-seated violence and discrimination.  
The situation is dire. In 2024 alone, at least 170 women were killed—the highest annual toll on record. Shockingly, recent reports show an average of one woman murdered every day in the past week. Yet despite this crisis, Kenya does not legally recognize femicide as a distinct crime. Without this recognition, these killings are ignored, poorly tracked, and often go unpunished.  
Why This Matters?
🔴 No Recognition, No Justice – Femicide is treated as just another homicide, allowing perpetrators to evade accountability.  
🔴 A Deadly Pattern We Can’t Ignore – These murders keep happening because the root causes—misogyny and systemic discrimination—are overlooked.  
🔴 Naming It Saves Lives – Countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Italy have recognized femicide as a crime, leading to stronger laws, better investigations, and greater protections for women.  
Kenya has the chance to be the first African nation to take this critical step—setting a powerful example for the continent and affirming that women’s lives matter.  
Our Demands
We call on the Kenyan government to:  
✅ Legally define femicide as a distinct crime to ensure proper tracking and accountability.  
✅ Strengthen laws and policies to prevent these killings and protect women.  
✅ Guarantee thorough investigations and justice for victims.  
✅ Increase funding for survivor support services.  
We have laws protecting property and money—yet when a woman’s life is stolen for being a woman, the system fails her. This must change.  
Justice begins with recognition. Justice begins with us.  
Sign this petition today to demand Kenya declare femicide a crime.

When Kevo went to buy a Toyota Fielder in Mombasa… (Brace yourself),"Kevo is still too traumatized to speak in full sentences. 😭

So Kevo decides he’s done being carless in Nairobi. Tired of begging Ubers and being told *“siko mbali, niko tao”* by a guy in Rongai.

So Kevo jets down to Mombasa,  lands  like a king. Shirt open, chest out, stress low to buy a Toyota Fielder from his boy who owns Alasiri Motors. They went to the same high school, both got suspended for reasons we don’t discuss anymore. Straightforward mission. Car is smooth, engine purrs like a cat that pays rent. Everything is clicking.  
BUT.  
This is Kevo we’re talking about. A man who has never seen red flags. Only maroon decorations. 😩  
After the car deal, Kevo turns to Alasiri and says: ""Bro... I’ve never clapped buibui cheeks. Sasa niko Coast, si mnipee experience ya wenyeji""

INSTEAD of telling him to pray and go sleep, Alasiri claps his hands like Thanos and goes,  
“Weh. Umefika. Wacha nicheze kama mimi.”

They roll up to Bamburi. You know that place where logic goes to die and thighs roam free like devolution funds.  
They hit the club.  
Lights dim. Music loud.  
Enter: vodka + poor decisions combo pack (Kenya Cane + ego).

Then Kevo sees *HER*.  
Tall. Graceful. Wrapped in a black buibui like she was hiding state secrets and heartbreak.  
The way her fabric floated in the coastal breeze? Bro almost proposed right there with airtime.

Kevo leans to Alasiri and whispers,  
*""Bro, hiyo ni wife material ya UAE. She’s wrapped like economy is hard but heart is soft.""*

Kevo approaches her with the swagger of a man who’s never known defeat, only delays.  
Drops a few lies.  
Mentions he owns land in Kamulu and drives a hybrid.  
Buibui giggles. (Kevo took it as flirtation. It was witchcraft 🧙🏾‍♂️)

She agrees to roll back to his hotel.

Alasiri, like a good wingman, drops them at the hotel around 11:15PM.  
Then dips. Switches to husband mode. Phone on DND.  
Bro is unavailable like NHIF when you need it most.

**THEN.**

Morning comes.  
Alasiri opens his eyes to 22 MISSED CALLS from Kevo.  
From 2AM to 6:30AM.  
Even God was still buffering. But Kevo? Fighting demons.

He calls back.

Kevo picks on the first ring, breathless. Voice trembling like a Safaricom MPESA outage.“BROOOOOOOO... HII BUIBUI... SI NI KIJAMAA!!!!! 😭😭😭”

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Plot twist from Riverwood itself.  
The “mrembo” was a fully assembled man.  
Guy had more equipment than a boda boda spare parts shop.

Apparently, things got spicy. Kevo reached to ""unveil the mystery"" like Moses and the burning bush...  
Only to find a **shock absorber**.

He screamed so loud the hotel wanted to change their name to *""Whispers Inn.""*

The buibui bro, completely unbothered, sipped water and said:  
“Si I thought we were vibing?”

**VIBING WHERE??? IN GETHSEMANE???**

Kevo lost it.

Started rebuking the room like it owed him rent.  
Shouted “Rudi nyuma shetani!” DRUNK, while holding a Gideon’s Bible from the drawer.  
Tried to jump out the window in boxers with one sock.  
Security came thinking there was a robbery.  
Manager knocked.  
Buibui bro sat calmly, legs crossed, sipping his/her Keringet like “I did nothing. He picked me.” 💅

Kevo’s soul left his body three times that night.  
But Alasiri? Bro was snoring in his matrimonial bed. Dreaming of loyalty and lentils.

Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",Kenya,bravoyankee37,2025-04-07 19:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,4,3,usaid kenya funding cut
Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes.

MEXT,"

Last year I made a post informing people about the existence of this scholarship. 
I just wanted to remind you guys early enough this year. 

And I also decided to repost a comment I had made last year regarding the process. 

The process.(For people planning to apply for postgraduate studies; masters and PhD)

1st step is document screening.

They'll need a bunch of documents from you. An application form, which can be downloaded from their website, medical form, research proposal, certified documents( So you'll need to go to your school to have your degree and transcripts certified), and a recommendation letter( I think they insisted on this letter being from the Dean of studies, but I got mine from my department head). Also, a passport photo of you.

Last year, the documents were required in 3s. So if it's the application form, you fill it out, print it out, then make 2 more copies. Same with other documents. Don't staple the documents together. Use paper clips to attach them together.

All the documents will need to be dispatched at the Japanese embassy. It's located in upperhill, very close to CIC insurance building.

But it's important to check the website because they might need more or less documents for this year.

I should mention that there's a section on the application form that requires the applicant to list down 3 universities of choice. This section is usually super confusing if you don't know any Japanese universities but just look up 3 universities that have your course and write them down. This section can be changed later. But you do need to remember the universities you picked because they like to ask applicants during the interview stage to just mention the 3 universities they picked became they know we usually randomly pick.

2nd step English and Japanese Exam

If you pass the first stage, they'll call you for an English and Japanese written exam at the Japanese embassy. For Japanese, just guess, it's multiple choice, so just pick anything and hand in the paper. The Japanese exam exists to check your proficiency in the language. So, if you aren't proficient, then just show them that you aren't.

But for English, you need to get everything or nearly everything. The website usually has some past papers attached for anyone who needs to practise a bit before the exams. Go through the papers and familiarise yourself with the content. The English exam is not usually hard, but it's tricky. It's one of those papers where A and B can seem like probable answers, and you need to pick one. Time also runs very fast, and last year, they didn't add any time, so some people didn't make it because they did not finish in time. Also, if you dig around online, you'll find more papers. It's very important to do more papers. I did 10 papers.  It helped a lot.

3rd Step Interview

If you pass the second step, they'll call you for an interview. The interview is usually scheduled a few days after the exams. I did the exam on Friday and got a call on Monday afternoon about an interview that was scheduled for Tuesday. The questions will be general at first, questions like 'Why Japan as the country of choice?' 'How sure are you that you'll complete the course?' Etc. To questions that focus solely on your research proposal. Don't ignore small things like knowing the full title of your project, the objectives, the methodology, etc. They might also ask you to explain in brief more about the proposal.

Also, I should mention that because this scholarship is annual, they are a lot of people who have already gone through the process which means there are a lot of YouTube videos that can help you prepare for this part. They usually ask the same questions every year. There's also a MEXT sub that helped me a lot when I was applying.

4th Step: Application to universities in Japan

If you pass the 3rd step, they will call you again to present to you a 'certificate of first screening'. Which means you've completed the first stage. This stage usually involves contacting universities, more specifically, professors, asking them if they can take you as a student. The facilitators of the scholarship will email you a long list of universities plus their email contact, and it's your job to look up the universities and find a couple that you'd like to contact. When looking up universities, it's important to make sure the language of instruction for teaching is English because there's a very huge possibility that some programs are offered in Japanese only..

Remember how I mentioned that the universities you picked when you were filling out the application form could be changed. This is where you will change them.

You'll be given about a month to do this step.and in the end, you need to get at least 2 professors who will agree to take you up. The professors usually send you a letter of acceptance that you'll give the embassy much later. Around October, I think. They'll also ask you to rank the schools in order of priority even though they'll probably be the ones to make the final selection at the end. The rule of thumb is that public universities will be prioritized over private ones because they are cheaper to fund. 

I should mention that it's nearly impossible to miss out on the scholarship after passing the interview stage. Because it hasn't happened in 18 years that a student has missed the chance after passing the interview. But you still need to be diligent with the entire process.

5th Step Waiting Stage.

The deadline for submission of the letters of acceptances will probably be in October. And after you dispatch the letters at the Embassy, you'll just have to wait until they contact you again.

I really didn't like this stage because they went quiet till Feb this year. You might get hints from the school that picked you through emails explaining things like arrival dates and entrance exams to be taken, if any, but the embassy  will not communicate until Feb.

My hints started coming around December. But it was hard to know which school the Embassy had picked, so I still had to wait until the final communication was made. This year, they communicated around Feb 15th 2024. But I should mention, after that date things will start moving very very fast.

One last important thing is that even though the scholarship is funded, they will need you to source around 2000 dollars for the first month. This is usually required because they need you to open a Japanese bank account that they will be depositing your stipend in, and you can't open the bank account from Kenya. The stipend is around 144,000 yen. Because the currency rates have been fluctuating alot one of the facilitators told me that anything above 1000 dollars would still be good enough.

Last thing, If you get past the interview stage, start learning Japanese immediately. You can use duolingo to learn small introductions and also the Japanese alphabet. I've just started the classes, and they are rather intense 😅.

I’ll also include the link to the embassy here https://www.ke.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/Postgraduate.html. 

The link should have the application documents needed and also similar outline to the lengthy process I described above. 

If you need any guidance you can reach out, but please read the very lengthy process I’ve outlined below before reaching out. And also visit the website. 

Things might have changed so it’s critical to visit the website. ",Kenya,Difficult-Koala-6876,2025-04-05 01:55:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jrso38/mext/,312,82,usaid kenya funding cut

What’s Happening to the Kenyan Youth? A Reflection on Violence and Rejection!,"Another tragic story unfolds—a young girl’s life cut short, her body reportedly hidden in a water tank above a hostel. The suspected perpetrator? Her boyfriend. This heartbreaking incident raises urgent questions about the state of our youth today.

What is happening to our young men and women? Is rejection so unbearable that it drives some to commit such heinous acts? As Gen Z navigates a world of social media pressures, economic challenges, and shifting cultural norms, are we failing to equip them with the tools to handle rejection, disappointment, and conflict?

Statistics paint a concerning picture. In Kenya, youth unemployment stands at a staggering 35%, compared to the national average of 10%. Substance abuse and mental health issues are also on the rise, with leaders urging communities to address these challenges. Additionally, 75% of Kenya’s population is under 35, meaning the youth are not just the future—they are the present.

We’ve all faced rejection in our lives, yet we moved on. Why does it seem harder for today’s youth? Is it the lack of mentorship, the erosion of traditional values, or the overwhelming influence of digital culture?

Let’s discuss: How can we better support our youth to navigate life’s challenges without resorting to violence?

This might be discouraging to up coming Kenyan startup/ tech businesses.There are good Kenyan start up eg Reduzer  Technologies, that offer good products/ projects and others out there.We shouldn't let just good startups fail in Kenya. They not only offer employment to the tech community but also to non tech communities eg the fruit vendors and food vendors

Tanzania's on a new ruthless offensive against Kenya: New taxes targeting Kenya's critical exports.,"

Tanzania has hit Kenya with a new wave of taxes. This time, targeting eggs, dairy and manufactured goods including yoghurt, milk, biscuits, sweets, and chocolate. 

The new taxes are charged on weight, at ksh50 (TSH 1,000) per KG of imports. These taxes will worsen the pain of our already-struggling manufacturing sector. In 2024, our exports to TZ fell by a staggering ksh 4.2 billion due import duties. 

TZ is coupling these taxes with secret incentives and inducements  with an ultimate goal of attracting Kenya manufacturing towards Tanzania. 

It noteworthy that Tanzania is promising investors lucrative enticements, including economic and political stability and access to a larger market. TZ can access to both EAC and SADC. That's why they are particularly keen on the latter, as it offers a bigger market, at $1.2 Trillion compared to $296 billion of EAC. TZ also enjoys good diplomatic relationship with EAC members and has cemented it's export position to Uganda, DRC, Rwanda, Burundi. Thus, they have the luxury of alienating Kenya and continue enjoying EAC benefits.

Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

African American Letdowns,"The AA community has been considering Nairobi as an alternative destination that previously was Accra in Ghana. 

Tbh, I am all for it. I always side with them since they’ve always accomplished a lot despite the weight they’ve been handed. It’s refreshing to see people who look like us, they’re on of us. No hate to the white community, you all are welcome here as well, no racism. 

My only concern is the caliber of AA we’re getting. Look at the likes of Brandon Odira and the others are only out here to sleep around and fulfill their sexual desires because most of them wouldn’t be getting laid back in the States where women are empowered and smart. 

Back to the topic, why don’t we attract a high caliber of AA folks who can create Enterprise Businesses, Cutting Edge technology and even School for Gifted Kids? Maybe they we’re being judged by their character all along and not the color of their skin (joking).

Would you take her back?,"(**Update:** He broke up with me so you guys don't have to comment to leave him anymore)

 I (22F) have been seeing a guy (29M) for nearly 6 months now. I fell for him really hard at the start, but he didn't seem to feel the same way. It seemed like he was just there for a good time so I went with it, just happy to be around. We would have these disagreements, and he would ghost me for 1-2 weeks every time. Regardless of who was actually in the wrong, I would apologize and wait for him. The first time this happened I found out he slept with another girl. I was upset, and after that we made things exclusive. I never asked any questions about the girl or their relationship, I just trusted it wouldn't happen again. He had to leave the country abruptly for a month and again, I waited for him. I didn't speak to any other guys. In general I'm very reclusive and hardly speak to anyone outside of work/family, so its not like this was some massive exertion on my end.

He came back, and another incident happened where he ghosted me for something HE did wrong. Again I apologized. He traveled somewhere for New Years and he only told me like the day before he left. I also had plans with friends so I brushed it off and never really worried about what he got up to on his trip, whereas he was constantly speculating that I slept with other guys on mine (I didn't)

After New Years things got more real between us. I feel like he got more vulnerable and he also ended up telling me he loved me and wanted something long term. This meant a lot to me because he's normally so emotionally closed off that I never expected it. Despite the fact that his behaviour often signaled otherwise, I decided to believe him and we were locked in from there.

Everything was perfect until an incident happened this one night. It was an accident, I basically broke something VERY VERY important of his. ACCIDENTALLY. It sucked because I couldn't come up with any tangible solutions to fix it (It was really expensive) so all I could say was sorry. Immediately after it happened he told me he had to leave the country to fix it and sent me home with no further word. I texted him apologizing again (It was really all I could do) and I got ghosted again. Now, going off of what he told me I assumed he actually up and left the country without saying anything at all to me, even though he knew that it was an accident. After everything this was lowkey my last straw and I decided it made sense to just move on. Like if a broken item is all it takes for you to decide you've had enough of me then I should just see myself out.

So after being ghosted I made a decided effort to find someone else. This isn't something I would typically do but I felt really hurt and abandoned and I just needed someone to validate me. I started texting another guy. We actually got on, to the point that he started planning a date. I get home from work the day the date was scheduled and start to get ready and guess who had texted? The same guy who ghosted me. Turns out he managed to fix the problem here in Kenya and was still around. He wanted to see me and I immediately blew off the other guy. I met up with him and we pick up where we left off.

Here's where the problem arises. At some point during our interaction he grabbed my phone...and saw texts from another guy. I panic, grab my phone back and just completely refuse to show him the chat. We went back and forth about it the entire night with no conclusion. At some point he made me block the guy. I did but I unblocked him right after (I still felt like we were on rocky terms and I subconsciously wanted the other guy as back up). A couple of days later, the same thing happens. The guy I blew off texted me trying to reschedule the date and my man saw it. He didn't see the exact text but he saw a message from another guy and started demanding to see it. Again I refuse and frantically made up excuses about who the text was from, but deep down he didn't buy it.

At this point I realize its become too much, so I cut all contact with the other guy and never look back. Despite this, the whole scenario is now a point of contention in my situationship. It gets to the point that my man asks for my instagram password and I give it to him, but first I blocked the guy who had wanted to take me out so my man wouldn't see. Turns out he was looking at my follower count the whole time and saw it go down by one when he asked for my password lol.

At this point I just decided to tell him the truth. I accepted that he might not want to be with me but he should at least know what actually happened. Once I tell him that I almost went on a date with another guy and that I would have, had he not texted me at that exact moment, he starts crashing out. Saying I always had ""bop tendencies"" that he ignored, asking me invasive questions about my body count. Telling me he thinks I've been sleeping with other guys while he's away and that he can't trust me to hold it down while he's out of the country if it only took me days to move on after he ghosted me. In his defense I haven't been transparent and I can see why his mind would go to the worst case scenario, but none of that is true. I haven't slept with anyone else since the day I met him, I don't go out unless its with him and after that one disaster I haven't texted ANY other guys.

He logged into my instagram and he's now convinced that I deleted a bunch of chats so that he wouldn't see (I didn't, like I said earlier I just don't speak to people in general). He said he needs time to think, and that he feels like logically he can't trust me to be his girl. From a logical perspective I can empathize but at the same time I literally didn't actually do anything?? Yes I spoke to another guy when he GHOSTED me but I didn't let it actually go anywhere? He genuinely seems devastated and I feel bad because the truth isn't THAAAT bad but he's genuinely convinced himself that I've cheated when I fully haven't.

The Affordable Handshake: Will Ruto’s Dalliance with Baba Fade Before the Ink Dries?,"There is an african proveeb that says ""He who swallows a whole coconut must trust his anus."" 

Ruto has just swallowed the biggest political coconut of his life i.e shaking hands with Raila Odinga. And now, he must trust that his political stomach can digest it without embarrassing consequences. This is not just a handshake; it’s a full-course meal of survival politics, and Ruto knows that without Raila, his presidency risks serious indigestion.

Today’s handshake at State House wasn’t just a photo-op, it was Ruto and Raila signing their political death wish. And when the time comes, Gen Z, the undertaker, will conduct their final rites in August 2027.

Ruto, the self-proclaimed anti-dynasty warrior, has now tied his fate to Baba’s heartbeat. If, God forbid, Raila took an unscheduled trip to the ancestors tonight, Ruto would blow the entire 2025/26 national budget on witchdoctors, Silicon Valley AI, and importing foreign rogue pastors to try and resurrect him. And best believe, he’d out-mourn the Odinga familybwith his tears flooding the streets of Bondo while wearing the defeated look that Kimani Ichungwa had on Al Jazeera's Mehdi.

Forget the Finance Bill riots or Gen Z’s X Space rants—this would be the real crisis. Ruto, on his knees, wailing, “Hustlers, we need Baba back, or I’m finished!” Kenyan politics thrives on these dramatic alliances, and Ruto knows his Mount Kenya votes are already doing the Harlem Shake after Gachagua’s impeachment. Without Raila, he’s just a hustler with no dynasty to lean on.

Of course, Baba has been given billions, it’s become tradition at this point. But at 82, will he exhaust the billions before the sun sets on him? Will he have enough time to enjoy the spoils, or will nature cash its check before he does?

Another wise African Proverb says that a monkey that dances by the roadside must be prepared for stones.

For years, Ruto paraded himself as the anti-handshake champion, swearing he’d never share power with Raila. But today, the same Ruto is dancing by the roadside—and the stones are coming. The same Kenyans that roasted Uhuru for shaking Raila’s hand in 2018 is now polishing their slingshots, ready to fire at this new bromance. If Ruto thought Uhuru’s handshake was unpopular, wait till he sees what 2027 has in store.

Ruto has now invited Baba for tea faster than you can say ‘blood-based government.’ With ODM figures in Cabinet and Raila’s AUC bid flopped, Ruto’s presidency is basically a high-stakes chama where Baba is the treasurer holding all the cash 😂. If Raila checks out, Ruto’s left clutching a useless chequebook, out-crying the Odingas at the funeral, and begging the IMF for a loan to hire a time machine.

Meanwhile, Azimio diehards would scream deep state conspiracy, claiming Raila was taken out just to keep Kalonzo waiting forever.

Context is everything: Ruto’s been juggling a rebellious Mount Kenya, a sulky Uhuru, and a Gen Z movement ready to storm State House armed with Wi-Fi and vibes. Raila is his political oxygen mask—lose him, and he’s gasping in the thin air of 2027 re-election dreams. You’d see a state-sponsored sob-fest so dramatic, it’d make Mexican telenovelas jealous. The man might even pawn the Harambee House furniture to fund a “Resurrect Raila Taskforce” featuring NASA (the space agency, not the coalition) and a hotline to Wakanda.

This is peak Kenyan politics: one minute, you’re enemies; the next, you’re bromancing so hard that if one dips, the other is ready to bankrupt the nation and outweep the family, just to keep the show going.

Wait, was it a discounted dynasty alliance? Either way, Ruto just bought what he swore he’d never touch—at a price Kenya might soon start feeling.

Ruto’s not just shaking hands—he’s clutching on Raila like a lifeline. But will the lifeline hold until 2027, or will Gen Z deliver the final rites?

Ruto and Jayesh Saini have ruined our public health system,"Around december the [daily nation](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/mystery-supplier-to-get-sha-billions-4843936#story) reported that GoK had secretly entered into a hospital equipment leasing scheme dubbed the National Equipment Support Program[NESP]. Governors were [coereced](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/12/ruto-terms-kahigas-coercion-claims-in-county-medical-lease-scheme-untrue/) into signing those agreements with wahindi brokers (the jayesh saini cartel). Instead of going directly to original equipment manufacturers like GE and ROCHE - ruto's regime went to the brokers (recently a CT scan burst into [flames](https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/ct-scan-machine-at-kericho-hospital-destroyed-in-fire-n358467) at kericho). Under  [Uhuru](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/ge-to-admit-first-batch-of-health-workers-at-sh1-3bn-training-hub--2118720) - we also had an equipment leasing program [MES] but most of it was with OEMs. They would directly provide support services.

Now here comes the juicy part - under the NESP agreement. For each claim under SHA in public hospitals, the hospitals are required to pay [60%](https://x.com/Dialmaterialist/status/1895086475378565308?t=BRr6Fp_JYr9BkrVqGQFmgQ&s=19) of that figure to  the vendors (equipment brokers). SHA makes direct payment to the vendors. Public hospitals will never touch the 60%.

We now move to the second part of the [SHA heist](https://x.com/Martowachira/status/1896617548403322902?t=DfZOTcpT5yv7nZt5d1u5QQ&s=19). The consortium of Apeiro, Safaricom and Konvergenz network solutions, which has 104 billion agreement gets 5% of all hospital claims and  1.5% for a track and trace solution. On top, they also get 2.5% of all member contributions made to SHA.


Therefore, ruto and the wahindi brokers get 60% +5% +1.5% + 2.5% of all member contributions = 66.5% + 2.5% of the total SHA collection per month/year

That leaves public hospitals with approximately ~30% to run their operations. Assuming they were to be self-sustaining, the 30% would have to cater for staff of all cadres, acquire drugs from KEMSA, electricity bills, water, waste disposal, repairs etc

You can also factor in the [frequent delays](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/counties-hit-as-treasury-delays-cash-disbursements-4763402) in transferring devolved funds  to county governments -

Consequentially, public hospitals can't function effectively under this system.

Faith- based hospitals are somehow able to survive because they don't have to pay 60% to the wahindi brokers for leased medical equipment

Kenya’s Economic Reality: Why Fighting Corruption Alone Won’t Fix Our Problems,"I was having a discussion with my friends about the state of sports in Kenya, and one of them was passionately arguing that the government does very little to support sports. While that’s true, a deeper look at successful sports industries worldwide shows that sports are largely private enterprises. Private investors own the teams, sponsor the leagues, and build the stadiums. The same applies to most thriving industries—large businesses that employ thousands are privately owned, not run by the state. Governments, after all, tend to be inefficient economic managers.

This got me thinking about Kenya’s economy and the role of government in development.

Our Revenue vs. Spending Needs

Last year, KRA collected KES 2.4 trillion in taxes, which sounds like a lot, but in reality, it’s far from enough. If we were to fund the country’s essential sectors at functional—not even first-world—levels, we would need:

Education – KES 850 billion

Healthcare – KES 700 billion

Police & Interior – KES 425 billion

Judiciary – KES 80 billion

County Allocations – KES 650 billion

Defense – KES 700 billion

Infrastructure Development – KES 1.2 trillion

Annual Debt Repayments – KES 1.85 trillion


That’s a total of KES 6 trillion per year, yet we only collect about KES 2.5 trillion, leaving a KES 3.5 trillion gap.

Corruption Isn’t the Only Problem

Many politicians and activists keep repeating the same talking point: ""We need to fight corruption."" Sure, corruption is a problem, but let’s be realistic—it won’t magically bridge this revenue gap. Even if we eliminated corruption completely and spent every shilling efficiently, we’d still be working with half the money we actually need—just enough to survive, not thrive.

This is where Kenya’s leadership has consistently failed. Where are the comprehensive economic policies? Where are the white papers outlining how we move from an economy based on agriculture and low-value industries to a high-value, industrialized economy?

The Missing Conversation: Private Investment & Economic Growth

Morara Kebaso, Martha Karua, and other critics of the current regime talk endlessly about corruption, but where is their economic plan? What strategies do they have for:

- Attracting private investors?

- Encouraging industrialization and manufacturing?

- Reducing reliance on primary production and low-value industries?


It is not the government’s job to build businesses or factories. The government’s role should be to create an environment where private investors can thrive—this means:

1. Security – Investors won’t risk their money in unstable environments.


2. A strong legal system – Property rights must be guaranteed.


3. Infrastructure – Roads, electricity, and digital connectivity must be in place.



Yet, these topics are rarely discussed in Kenyan political discourse.

Fighting Corruption is Expensive

If we’re serious about fighting corruption, we need to acknowledge something crucial—it’s hella expensive.

To effectively combat corruption, Kenya needs:

A well-funded judiciary – Corruption trials take time, resources, and skilled legal teams.

A strong police force – Anti-corruption agencies need proper funding and independence.

A capable defense system – A strong military isn’t just about external threats; it ensures national stability and can deter external actors who enable corruption (e.g., countries where corrupt officials stash their money).


Without this, anti-corruption rhetoric remains just that—rhetoric.

Kenya’s Stagnation: The Economics of Poverty

At the end of the day, we are stuck in a cycle where we don’t generate enough wealth to fund our institutions, yet we expect those same underfunded institutions to drive change. It won’t happen. We need to:

1. Shift our economic focus from primary production to value addition and industrialization.


2. Encourage private sector growth instead of looking to the government for everything.


3. Prioritize economic policies over empty political slogans.



Until then, we will remain trapped in the economics of poverty, talking about corruption while ignoring the bigger picture.

Honest question: Why nations fail?,"For context, I'm a student at a public university in the capital. So at various points this week, I've had discussions with my classmates on the trajectory of attaining wealth in the Kenyan sphere.

With a dose of reality, we came to the conclusion that its in Politics, industry (owning means of production) or a successful professional career.

But more emphasis is the route of politics. Is it a coincidence that our last 2 presidents are the top 10 richest people in the country? What business can Ruto or other politicians like Murkommen & Gachagua claim to have given them billions of shillings via entrepreneurship?

So the way I see it, most young people are potential thieves without opportunity. What stuck out to me the most was my classmates who are vying for student leadership positions are the ones most vocal in using political office to get 'fuck you money'.

And honestly, it's hard to blame them. There's a clear lack of entrepreneur role models in this country to whom the youth can look up to to inspire them to be titans of industry in the future. Not by stealing public funds, but by solving problems in the market.

22 year olds in the US, Estonia , China etc are looking to BUILD startups to be the next Sam Altman, Jack ma, and Elons. Here, 22 year olds are looking to form new political parties so as to gain power and rob the public they're meant to serve.

This is WHY NATIONS FAIL. When greed is allowed to fester, the country becomes an open wound. 

100 years from now, if we allow Kenya to weaken as our neighbors grow in strength, will we even be able to defend our borders? Will our children and grandchildren look forward to stay, work , love and grow their families here? Will we even be able to feed ourselves? That is the long term we need to see. Unless your plan is to emigrate, then enrich yourself by all means.

Rotten.,"Kasongo must go. 'Disclaimer: long story' 
But is he the only one really.? 

Kenyans we are good people. Very patriotic, very hospitable and all. On the books, yeah , On the screen. Well, there are genuine good people in this land. How many are they though. 

When it comes to money, who are you. Because weeeeeelllll......

I remember a few months after my graduation, i was calmly  job hunting. I wasnt it a hurry to get employed since I had already heard the phrase that tarmacking was a job in itself🤭 , Yaani my expectations were deep there with the manure. So this girl tells me, 'Baba dogo Kuna recruitments, lets go try our luck' Mimi huyo na vijikaratasi vyangu tumejibeba to there. The queue...! Wueeh You'd think it was relief food being distributed.. Anyway, we got in the queue.  By the way, it wasnt moving at all 😂 for the almost 3 hours i was there. Then comes this mama  looks at us and calls us aside. Wueeh turns out, 'bila doo tutajichomoa mipango iko na hatuezi haribu'' 😅 Wueeh, my trust in ONESTI couldnt allow me. told myself, ill not get conned in this Nairobi. The girl i was with was a bit more desperate akamake some calls and when she asked for a number to send to akapewa... (Not very smart as ive met a few penny gluttons who dont keep receipts. cash only).. Anyway after a while  few ( about 4 place nilikua) wakatoa. it was about 7000 shillings if i can remember correctly. So wakatengwa  and their names were called in. I bought some mayai pasua and ate to relieve my anger. Not hunger... I was Angry! 😠... Not because i couldnt afford the amount. Well.. i couldnt🤭.. But thats not the point. I thought Kenyans were better people..  

A few weeks later I went to this other place where a very nice 'Religious' Lady, Required some 5K to facilitate recruitment.. i mean the stories are endless . 
So currently i Work in a factory. I worked here for a bout a year then left to another place then came back. My role involes facilitating recruitments within my department doing interviews and all that. Not to say Im an angel but i have never demanded or suggested payment of any kind the first time i was here or now . While i was gone, they employed this woman to my position. Adding to the fact that shes a narcissist and is always looking for a reason to get people fired, man..! this one exceeds kasongo . So due to my position im usually incapable of handling the interviews so she does.. So i got concerned with thd high rate of tutnovers we had at our department and decided to dig around. Turns out she operates a 'school' where people pay 10000 sh for a two hour session on what theyll be asked in the interview. I left a team of about 60 people,, and on coming back, less than a year later, only less than 5 of the original personnel were left. and these ones..?? they eat dust on a daily basis to try and get them to quit!.. So i organised a small recruitment to try and fill in some gaps, about 7 people. These ones have been eating dust as well since 'hawakutithe'.  so comes this lady one time with cash about 5k. (One of the ones i had recruited) hands it to me. i ask her what its for. she tells me, 'sikua najua ntamalizia hiyo ingine next month' Im like .. 'Whaaat!???' So apparently ile mbio alipelekwa on asking around why she was told people give a certain amount during onboarding. Na aty nobody asks for it, aty hao they gave their 'tithe' Before recruitment. Who is being given the money ? 'Mwenye alikuinterview' they didnt know it was me since i rarely do interviews now. so she thought it could be because she gave nothing that shes being targeted and bullied 24/7. I sent her away na tithe yake.. yeah some of us are not gluttonous. 
I had heard about the stories about this woman. at some point she had a case going on but... 'no proof'. Out of all our personnel,  about 80% have greased her palms.. need promotion?? Get some oil.. Still no proof..What does HR say you ask??, ...........................  She was against my coming back and has really trying to get me fired in whatever way possible. Shes about to succeed as I'm about to quit. Its just too much. Im too empathetic and all these cases torture me. and the fact that i can do nothing about it all, fills me with anger.. i put in my resignation and people are begging me not to go. they need this job and if i go, theyll probably be outed for some petty reasons.. 
Will we ever get better? My soul hurts for Kenya really kasongo was cut from the same fabric as all of us. He is who we are. Sadly ",Kenya,Bronzestrong,2025-02-23 02:19:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ivzkzx/rotten/,23,9,usaid kenya funding cut

Life After Campus: A Hard Landing.,"Coming back home after campus is like walking into a different world altogether. The jubilation of graduation quickly fades when you return to your family's house, degree in hand but pockets empty. As a man, the expectations weigh heavier - you're supposed to be the provider now, not the one still being provided for.

The mornings become a strange ritual. You wake up early out of habit, but there's nowhere to go. Your mother gives you questioning looks as you lounge around in yesterday's clothes. Your father's sighs grow longer each day. The neighbors, who celebrated your graduation just months ago, now avoid eye contact when you pass on the street.

In Kenya, the job hunt is a another job and masterclass in frustration. You send out countless applications into what feels like a void. The few responses you get often end with, ""We shall call you. "" /""Tutakupigia."" The truth slowly dawns on you - MOST positions are already filled BEFORE they're advertised, reserved for someone's son, nephew, or village-mate.

Your classmates with connected parents or recognizable surnames move quickly into comfortable positions. Meanwhile, you scroll through LinkedIn, watching their success stories unfold while you debate whether you can afford to buy airtime to make another follow-up call.

The shame cuts deep. Cultural expectations dictate that a man should be self-sufficient, a provider. Instead, you find yourself asking for bus fare to attend interviews that lead nowhere. Your younger siblings still look up to you, unaware that the system is stacked against those without the right connections.

At family gatherings, relatives who once boasted about you now interrogate you with thinly veiled disapproval: ""So, what are you doing these days?"" The question stings more each time. Your responses grow shorter, your attendance at these functions less frequent.

This is the untold story of campus life - not the vibrant social scene or academic achievements, but the harsh landing that follows. IN a SYSTEM WHERE MERIT OFTEN TAKES BACKSEAT TO CONNECTIONS, the journey from graduation to employment becomes a test of resilience that no lecturer ever prepared you for.",Kenya,Longjumping_Truth498,2025-02-18 13:27:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iscmxv/life_after_campus_a_hard_landing/,21,18,usaid kenya funding cut
When fate has Other Plans....,"This post is inspired by [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ip7f2e/hii_imeenda_literally/).

Reminds me of my younger days when I got 'dumped' by this girl – though I actually initiated the breakup, I had been dumped already! *(Back then or do women still do this? A woman would breakup with you, but let you be the one to initiate the breakup by doing something to provoke you! Let you do the dirty deed so that she can walk away with a 'clean' slate)*

Back then, I was around 24-25 when I met this girl at Gill House near the Double M buses where we had to queue. I joined the line and initiated a conversation with her. There were no smartphones and no social media then, so there was nothing to distract us, making it easy to chat.

The conversation flowed easily. Turns out she had moved to Nairobi after completing campus and was looking for a job. I saw her again the next day and exchanged contacts. (Don't ask why I didn't get her number on day one – you younger guys move too fast! I was a believer in fate, and I figured if it was meant to be, I would see her again!)

A few weeks later, we were dating! Or seeing each other, at least. I was on cloud 9, but my bubble was about to burst. I had invited her to my small crib for a date on a Sunday afternoon (do you guys still meet up on Sunday afternoons?). I picked her up at the stage – again, this is how we used to date 'back in the day.' She called to say she had arrived at the stage, so I left my house, which wasn't far, to meet her. We walked home together, but something was unusual – she seemed too smartly dressed for a Sunday hangout, with a nice dress, cologne, and her hair done up.

To cut a long story short, after reaching my place (kufika keja), she gave me a long-winded story about how she couldn't stay long, something about having to deliver things to her best friend in town (sijui eti kuna vitu anaafaa kupelekea beste tao) – blah blah blah. I said ""sawa"" (okay), but told her if she left, that would be the end of whatever we had. She left anyway, and I knew it was over (nikajua hiyo imeenda)!

I moved on with life. Fast forward many years later, about 10 or 11 (we had no WhatsApp or Facebook then, so there was no way to see updates about her), I met her at a banking hall. What struck me was how short she was! (I have nothing against short people – this just hadn't struck me before.) I'm slightly above average height (5'11"") and had previously dated – and was dating at the time – a much taller woman (who's now my wife). I wondered why I hadn't noticed this before! I saw her and questioned what it was about her that had broken my heart so badly back then. Not that she was not good looking but could see now what i had seen then.

My preference had always been taller women, and height had always been one of my criteria for dating. There was – and still is – something I find attractive about taller women. Had I married her, maybe I wouldn't have been happy!

So take heart, all you broken-hearted folks out there. One day you'll look back and wonder, ""What was I thinking! or what did i see in him/her!""",Kenya,Mkenya_Fulani,2025-02-14 17:29:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ipfwrs/when_fate_has_other_plans/,3,1,usaid kenya funding cut
"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back.",Kenya,random_raven,2025-02-07 08:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,1,2,usaid kenya funding cut

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Advice for every kenyan who works for an NGO (Non governmental organization),"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but the recent move by President Trump to cut donor funding will affect your payslip and i am sure of it. Most NGO's are funded through donor support. Your bosses may not tell you, but in the next 2-3 months, most of you will have to be let go (fired). You need to start making deliberate decisions to prepare for that eventuality. I know you are used to good salaries (200k - 500k) and you probably live in an apartment of 60k-120k. First things first..

1) Look for a cheaper rental house (20k max) that you can afford to pay without struggling.

2) Avoid taking any loans (cars, mortgage) cos this will exacerbate your situation incase you are fired

3) Start thinking of a business you can setup (be smart about it, businesses that target basic needs like food, clothing, shelter tend to do good)

4) Start praying that Trump will change his mind and that the donor support will not be halted.",Kenya,wangai254,2025-02-06 09:48:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iiyykv/advice_for_every_kenyan_who_works_for_an_ngo_non/,3,4,usaid kenya funding cut

Trump/ The Republicans are not guessing he is implementing Project 2025,"Project 2025 is a political plan developed by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in the United States, to prepare for a potential Republican administration in 2025. 

It is essentially a blueprint for how a new conservative president could reshape the U.S. government.  

The plan focuses on four main pillars:  

1. Policy Agenda – It outlines conservative policies for major government agencies, including reducing government regulations, cutting welfare programs, and increasing executive power. 

2. Personnel – It aims to recruit and train conservative individuals to fill key government positions, ensuring the administration aligns with their ideology.  

3. Training Academy – It includes an online education program to train appointees on how to implement conservative governance.  

4. Transition Plans – It provides a detailed strategy to quickly implement these policies as soon as a Republican president takes office.  

For Kenya, Project 2025 might is  relevant in terms of U.S. foreign policy, as it proposes changes to how America engages with international organizations, aid programs, and global trade.

The end of USAID means Kenyan's losing their jobs,"There is probably a whole industry of local Kenyan workers in NGOs and other organizations that were benefiting from US dollars in the form of USAID funding and other organizations. People who were getting Ksh400k salaries and much better than that for doing much less work than their neighbours. Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents. Its become impossible for normal hustlers to find a decent place to live near Nairobi.

I wonder what happens to these people, can they find a job somewhere else?

Also Trump has not finished, there will be more cuts, more funds and organizations that are shut down.

So ARVs/TB drugs  aren’t free because the government loves us it’s because they are donations and US is among our major donors so yeah shortages in ARVs will probably happen especially with PEPFAR Funding Halt(  this simply means the orange dude  has ordered an immediate stop to the supply of lifesaving drugs for malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis ) We have other donors BUT them change will definitely be felt .

"If God is all-powerful, He cannot be all-good. And if He's all-good then He cannot be all-powerful","I heard this quote in 2016's Batman vs Superman. I was about 14 years old, a Christian like my parents. I dismissed it as blasphemous and didn't think about it much after that. But over the years, personal and geopolitical events have pushed me to examine spirituality through theological, logical, and historical lenses. I turn 22 this year and now I’m an atheist. This quote resonates with me in a way I never imagined it could.

**The DRC**

In Goma, a church was bombed less than a week ago. Yet, it barely made a blip in international media. The tragedy was just another drop in the ocean of atrocities. A Congolese national on TikTok shared a video of his team delivering aid when a bomb landed just meters away. You can hear the gunshots in the background as they scrambled for safety. In the same video, a woman and her young child calmly narrate the bombing like it’s just another day. Children are trafficked and enslaved to mine the cobalt and coltan that power our smartphones and electric cars. They die in suffocating pits, crushed under collapsing earth. The ones who survive often endure daily abuse, starvation, and diseases no child should ever face. I could give you the statistics but we have been desensitized so that occurrence was the grunge reality of those on the ground. Ponder on it. Then go amplify [Pappy Orion TikTok's page](https://www.tiktok.com/@pappyorion) as he shares with the world the grim reality of those on the ground.

**Palestine**

The following are videos I've seen with my own eyes: A child sits in the rubble of their destroyed home, shaking uncontrollably, panicking, frantically looking for a place to hide as planes pass overhead. A man holds up a half-mutilated body of a child, missing parts from the torso down and flesh hanging off the place of severance. A father, holding the birth certificates of his newborn twins, weeps uncontrollably. They were killed in an airstrike while he was out running errands. A boy stares into the distance with a blank, emotionless face; his entire family is gone. How do you console a child whose world was obliterated in seconds? How do you justify children dying from heart attacks because they’re so paralyzed with fear? [The story of 5 year old Hind Rajab is just devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i9099v/the_story_of_hind_rajab/). But instead of universal outrage, we hear excuses. *""Shouldn’t have started a war you can’t win,""* they say. As if that justifies killing children. As if those children were combatants instead of victims. And to those claiming *""It started on October 7th,""* where were you when children were being humiliated, harassed, and terrorized by idf soldiers years before? This isn’t about land anymore. It’s about the inhumanity of it all. And if your reaction is to pick a side instead of mourning the dead, I don’t know what to tell you.

**Sudan**

The UAE has provided funding, logistics, and military equipment under the guise of securing its economic interests. Reports show that weapons and ammunition have been covertly supplied to the RSF, even as UAE denies involvement. Humanitarian aid shipments have been revealed as covers for arms transfers, and recent investigations by US lawmakers confirmed ongoing support from the UAE despite its official denials. Now over 10.2 million people displaced. More than 750,000 people on the brink of starvation. Entire communities wiped out as the RSF slaughters civilians with impunity, committing acts of genocide that shock even those hardened by years of conflict. Families, already living in desperate conditions, are left with no choice but to flee. Refugee camps swell with starving, sick, and traumatized survivors who may never see justice.

**Unequal Attention**

What breaks me most is how unequal the coverage is. It was easier to find the details of Palestinian atrocities than it was for Sudanese or Congolese ones. And I say this as an African. My own people, my brothers and sisters, are so overlooked that their suffering isn’t even documented properly. The media relegates African atrocities to footnotes, treating them as less significant than others. The world cries for Ukraine or Gaza, and they should, but where are those same voices for Sudan and the DRC? The silence is deafening.

**Theological Reflection**

I’m sick of hearing people try to explain this away. Whether in the DRC, Sudan or Gaza, the suffering is not part of some mysterious, divine plan. If God exists and allows this, He isn’t good. If He wants to stop it but can’t, He isn’t powerful. Claiming He’s all-loving in the face of these horrors is an insult to every victim’s memory. Spare me the debates about free will or 'God works in mysterious ways.' There is no justification for this. No excuse for letting innocent children suffer, for letting entire families and communities be destroyed. If your God loves you, fine. But don’t call Him all-loving, because His actions (and lack thereof) don't reflect that.

**Historical Atrocities in the Name of God**

This isn’t a modern problem. Religion has justified horrors for centuries. The Crusades left rivers of blood in their wake. Colonialism destroyed entire continents. In Africa, missionaries came with Bibles in hand, preaching salvation while stealing land and stripping people of their culture. In the Americas, conquistadors slaughtered Indigenous people in the name of Christ. One Native American chief, before being executed by the Spanish, said, *""I do not want to go to heaven if that’s where the Spanish are.""* Can you blame him? Heaven was a place for the colonizers; a paradise for murderers who brought nothing but death and destruction. If that’s God’s plan, I want no part of it",Kenya,Current-Olive-6530,2025-01-24 18:23:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i926d9/if_god_is_allpowerful_he_cannot_be_allgood_and_if/,6,11,usaid kenya funding cut
How do I cut off friends?,"Wagwan wadau!

So I just realized that some of my friends are bums like myself! We've know each other for a while now BUT based on what I want for my future I'm starting to see them as deadweight.

All we do is party. I've come to the realization that I'm finding it hard to break old habits partially because of their influence. I feel lost in life and made some new year resolutions to turn my life around. I don't hate them BUT I'm finding it increasingly hard to make the necessary changes to my life when they are around. I just want some time to focus on my future and my self-improvement journey. 

I had recently planned on subscribing to a gym but I'm shocked to find out I just drunk all the funds I was planning on using. Now i'm going back to square one. I don't blame them for this BUT It has become clear that I can't properly manage my finances with them around. I've tried to convince them to start some business ventures or projects but these guys aren't clearly motivated as I am. Sometimes I don't want to tell them of the new opportunities I'm getting simply because I know when they know I'm getting paid, the chances of my keeping this money narrows drastically. Like I said, I'm trying to break old habits i.e smoking, drinking...etc and I just can't see myself doing this with them around. 

How do I cut them off, or at least withdraw from their company, without looking like an asshole or 'mtiaji'. I just want to disappear and take some time off to focus on myself and my goals. I feel like I'm in the same place I was 3 years ago. I'm planning on making 2025 my turning point and that's why I'm here. Life is hard for a man and the last thing I want to to be sitting in a room 10 years from now regretting the bad decisions I made in my youth.

PayPal Account Suspended,"I’m a security researcher and smart contracts auditor. Recently, I received a substantial bug bounty payout for a critical submission to a Web3 company. Everything seemed fine until this morning when I logged in and found my PayPal account suspended for 180 days. No prior warning, just a vague email citing “unusual activity” and a link to their Resolution Center.

As someone who relies on PayPal for professional transactions, this is a huge issue especially since the funds are tied up for months! I’ve already tried contacting support in the Resolution Center, but I’m worried about the lack of clarity and the long hold period. The standard web support feels like a black hole, and I’m not sure if my case is being prioritized.

Has anyone else in the security research or Web3 space faced PayPal suspensions after receiving large bounties? I’m wondering if the high-value transaction flagged their system, especially since it’s related to crypto/Web3. Any tips on how to explain this to PayPal to get it resolved faster?

Are there best practices for security researchers to prevent this kind of thing? For example, should I notify PayPal in advance about large incoming bounties?

I’m super frustrated, as this is my main account for handling payments, and 180 days is a long time to wait. Any advice, success stories, or specific steps you’ve taken to resolve similar suspensions would be greatly appreciated.

USAID Repercussions + Economy,"My neighbour’s wife was a very big shot in USAID and has now lost her job. Children have been removed from big private school. Husband is a big guy at PWC. Lifestyle changes are occurring rapidly as her income has vanished. Thousands of her USAID coworkers were sent home with no salaries. 

USAID Vendors, contractors, non-profits that received funding from them have all been left in a lurch. Sasa machozi zimeanza. 

Next is empty apartments around “high class” areas.

UN is laying people off left right and center.

When Kevo went to buy a Toyota Fielder in Mombasa… (Brace yourself),"Kevo is still too traumatized to speak in full sentences. 😭

So Kevo decides he’s done being carless in Nairobi. Tired of begging Ubers and being told *“siko mbali, niko tao”* by a guy in Rongai.

So Kevo jets down to Mombasa,  lands  like a king. Shirt open, chest out, stress low to buy a Toyota Fielder from his boy who owns Alasiri Motors. They went to the same high school, both got suspended for reasons we don’t discuss anymore. Straightforward mission. Car is smooth, engine purrs like a cat that pays rent. Everything is clicking.  
BUT.  
This is Kevo we’re talking about. A man who has never seen red flags. Only maroon decorations. 😩  
After the car deal, Kevo turns to Alasiri and says: ""Bro... I’ve never clapped buibui cheeks. Sasa niko Coast, si mnipee experience ya wenyeji""

INSTEAD of telling him to pray and go sleep, Alasiri claps his hands like Thanos and goes,  
“Weh. Umefika. Wacha nicheze kama mimi.”

They roll up to Bamburi. You know that place where logic goes to die and thighs roam free like devolution funds.  
They hit the club.  
Lights dim. Music loud.  
Enter: vodka + poor decisions combo pack (Kenya Cane + ego).

Then Kevo sees *HER*.  
Tall. Graceful. Wrapped in a black buibui like she was hiding state secrets and heartbreak.  
The way her fabric floated in the coastal breeze? Bro almost proposed right there with airtime.

Kevo leans to Alasiri and whispers,  
*""Bro, hiyo ni wife material ya UAE. She’s wrapped like economy is hard but heart is soft.""*

Kevo approaches her with the swagger of a man who’s never known defeat, only delays.  
Drops a few lies.  
Mentions he owns land in Kamulu and drives a hybrid.  
Buibui giggles. (Kevo took it as flirtation. It was witchcraft 🧙🏾‍♂️)

She agrees to roll back to his hotel.

Alasiri, like a good wingman, drops them at the hotel around 11:15PM.  
Then dips. Switches to husband mode. Phone on DND.  
Bro is unavailable like NHIF when you need it most.

**THEN.**

Morning comes.  
Alasiri opens his eyes to 22 MISSED CALLS from Kevo.  
From 2AM to 6:30AM.  
Even God was still buffering. But Kevo? Fighting demons.

He calls back.

Kevo picks on the first ring, breathless. Voice trembling like a Safaricom MPESA outage.“BROOOOOOOO... HII BUIBUI... SI NI KIJAMAA!!!!! 😭😭😭”

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Plot twist from Riverwood itself.  
The “mrembo” was a fully assembled man.  
Guy had more equipment than a boda boda spare parts shop.

Apparently, things got spicy. Kevo reached to ""unveil the mystery"" like Moses and the burning bush...  
Only to find a **shock absorber**.

He screamed so loud the hotel wanted to change their name to *""Whispers Inn.""*

The buibui bro, completely unbothered, sipped water and said:  
“Si I thought we were vibing?”

**VIBING WHERE??? IN GETHSEMANE???**

Kevo lost it.

Started rebuking the room like it owed him rent.  
Shouted “Rudi nyuma shetani!” DRUNK, while holding a Gideon’s Bible from the drawer.  
Tried to jump out the window in boxers with one sock.  
Security came thinking there was a robbery.  
Manager knocked.  
Buibui bro sat calmly, legs crossed, sipping his/her Keringet like “I did nothing. He picked me.” 💅

Kevo’s soul left his body three times that night.  
But Alasiri? Bro was snoring in his matrimonial bed. Dreaming of loyalty and lentils.

Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes.

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

USAID woes,"many people don't know how USAID made many Kenyans rich and enabled some to manage a better life(financially and health-wise) lakini saii it's visible

USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back.",Kenya,random_raven,2025-02-07 08:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,1,2,usaid suspended funding

Those jobs directly resulted in neighbourhoods like Ruaka, Roysambu, even way up waiyaki way like Muthiga suddenly having such high rents.

Conspiracy theorists assemble,"I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like reading them and I like thinking about possible conspiracy theories. The current one I am thinking about is Ruto deliberately sabotaged Raila’s AUC bid so that Raila can still be useful to him in local politics. If Raila won the chairmanship, the broad based government and narrative would have become less important for his coalition and as a result, Raila would not activate his local political networks to keep Ruto in power. 

How have those networks been utilised since the coalition? All protests have been infiltrated by “goonz”. Is this just a coincidence? You tell me.

The goonz have been extremely successful in dissuading young kenyans from protesting. The protests last year were gaining momentum and threatened to reach unprecedented levels until the goonz came in. Now every protest is overrun by goonz.

By disrupting protests, Ruto is hoping to lessen the negative press his administration is facing, safeguard his position and further solidify his budding authoritarian regime. The networks he gained through the coalition have been crucial in doing that.

If Raila won the AUC seat, I believe his focus would have been on his new role and it would have also undermined his leadership if his home country is at the forefront of committing human rights violations which is what Ruto’s administration would continue to do to deal with the protests. So what does Ruto and his aides do? Make the most outlandish statements before the AUC elections that weaken Kenya’s position amongst member states, costing Raila the seat and ensuring the only thing that will keep him occupied is the bread based government.


That is my theory.

Feel free to call it story za Jaba because like I said, I like conspiracy theories and I find them an interesting way to try and analyze the madness going on in this country.

"“AI is here, but it’s not coming for your job... if you know how to use it. 🇰🇪🔥”","Hey r/Kenya,

There’s a lot of talk online about AI replacing jobs, especially in tech. As someone deeply involved in coding and digital skills here in Kenya, I wanted to clear the air — and also share what’s actually happening in our space.

 Will AI replace programmers?

Yes and no. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and even basic “vibe coding” tools (that turn prompts into code) are automating repetitive coding tasks. Things like:

CRUD apps

Login screens

File scaffolding

Simple bug fixes

Unit test generation


That means entry-level or assistant dev work is changing fast.

BUT…
Here’s what AI can’t replace:
System design and architecture
Deep debugging and optimisation
Secure payment systems (think Mpesa, PayLink, etc.)
Team collaboration and human decision-making
Ethical reasoning (especially around data, bias, and AI itself)
If you’re learning how to think like a developer, not just code — you’re safe and valuable.

So what does this mean for Kenya?
Kenya has a growing dev community — and we’ve got a chance to lead, not get left behind. If we:

Embrace AI tools (don’t fear them)

Learn how to use AI as part of our dev process

Focus on building real solutions (fintech, govtech, healthtech)


We can build things that scale beyond borders. Imagine AI helping you build a local app in Kikuyu, Swahili, or Sheng faster than ever.


TL;DR:

AI is replacing tasks, not thinkers. If you’re learning how to build, solve problems, and work with tools like AI — your value just doubled.



Would love to hear your thoughts — are you worried about AI taking over, or already using it to speed up your projects?",Kenya,No_Fee101,2025-06-13 10:47:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lact4f/ai_is_here_but_its_not_coming_for_your_job_if_you/,4,1,development aid kenya
Thinking of Importing from Alibaba to Kenya? Here’s a Beginner-Friendly Guide on Taxes and Shipping Costs,"If you’re new to importing from Alibaba to Kenya, it can feel overwhelming at first — especially with all the terms and hidden costs. I’m still learning, but here’s what I’ve picked up from my experience and research so far:

# 1. What Is Alibaba, and How Does It Work?

* Alibaba.com is a website where you can buy goods directly from manufacturers (mostly in China).
* It’s best for bulk buying — not small, one-off items like on Jumia or AliExpress.
* Prices per item are much cheaper, but you usually have to meet a minimum order quantity (MOQ), like 50 or 100 pieces.
* After agreeing with a supplier, you pay and then choose a shipping method (air or sea).

# 2. Shipping Options Explained

Air Freight:

* Good for small packages or samples.
* Fast (5–10 days).
* Expensive — price goes up with weight and size.

Sea Freight:

* Better for large orders (cheaper per kg).
* Slower (3–6 weeks, depending on port and route).
* You’ll also need to clear the goods at Mombasa Port or use a clearing agent.

# 3. What Does “FOB” Mean?

* FOB = Free On Board. This means the supplier will deliver the goods to the nearest Chinese port, and you handle the shipping from there to Kenya.
* The opposite is CIF = Cost, Insurance, and Freight, where the supplier includes shipping in the price.
* With FOB, you can shop around for a cheaper shipping agent.

#  4. Taxes and Costs at the Port

When your goods arrive at the Port of Mombasa, you’ll have to pay import taxes before collecting them. These include:

* Import Duty – based on the type of goods.
* VAT – 16% of the value.
* Import Declaration Fee (IDF) – 2.25% of value.
* Railway Development Levy (RDL) – 1.5%.
* Sometimes Excise Duty if your product is regulated.

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) doesn’t always use the value you declared — they might calculate their own value using HS Codes (international product classification codes), which could be higher.

#  5. Tips for Saving Money as a Beginner

* Start small if possible — even a sample order teaches you a lot.
* Ask suppliers to clarify if they’re the factory or a trader (factories often offer better pricing).
* Consolidate shipping if ordering from multiple suppliers — it’s cheaper than separate packages.
* Use a clearing agent at Mombasa if you’re new — they handle paperwork and help avoid mistakes.
* Always budget at least 20–30% extra for taxes and fees after your goods arrive.

#  6. Final Thoughts

I’m still learning, but I wanted to share in case anyone else is just getting started. Feel free to add your experience or ask questions — I’ll answer what I can.

Kenyans in Diaspora,"I have recently been digging into challenges that Kenyans in diaspora face while investing in real estate and construction here in Kenya. Some include trusting incompetent relatives to manage their developments and falling into offplan scams. Whereas there are others who have successfully managed to invest with less issues. 

In regards to this, I have been keen on trying to come up with a turnkey construction solution where there is a firm that offers investment packages for enthuastic Kenyans in diaspora as well as foreigners. The packages include Design-Build, Design-Build-Operate and Build only. I believe offering a trustworthy construction  and project manager who will ensure proper management of their remittances and provide timely and efficient progress reports and milestones reports is probably what they need. In collaboration with a team of a law firm, a trusted real estate firm and maybe a few contruction works subcontractors, I think it would work and I will be able to facilitate their dream of becoming property owners.

Why the online hatred for Luos?,"If you logged into Twitter you'll see all kinds of insults being hurled at Luos for no apparent reason other than that some Luos slept overnight at a stadium in Homa Bay. 


The same Mt. Kenya bloggers insulting Luos were praising Kikuyus just a couple of months ago when Ruto hired crowds to attend his tour of the region. In fact, they were being praised online for being ""smart"", and that ""you can't buy a Kikuyu, you can only rent one"" 
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/revealed-money-angle-in-ruto-mt-kenya-tour-4991802#story


Now that Luos did the same. Admittedly, I don't know if it was a paid crowd or not but potato tomato. Luos are now being insulted with the same tribal stereotypes that have been propagated by ignorant politicians and masses since independence. 

For context, Luos make up only 10% of Kenya's electorate, so they can't really elect a president alone. So how they manage to rile up the much larger Mt Kenya region that has elected 3 presidents, baffle me. Even more so, many Luos don't support Raila or Rutos government. I'm fact according to a TIFA poll recently, 49 percent of Nyanza residents don't support Ruto's government and a further 29 percent are undecided, with only 21 percent in support. 
https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2025-05-28-majority-of-kenyans-opposed-to-broad-based-government-tifa


That hasn't stopped Gachagua bloggers from leading the tribal march against the few Luos supporting the government, in fact all Luos are blanketed in condemnation by these pathetic tribalist shitlings. Since last night, the assault on the broader Luo community appears to have been well coordinated and has been a success on their part. 


Gachagua, a tribalist and ignorant leading Mt Kenya politician has bet his political future on riling his base using anti-Luo sentiments. From ""shareholders"" remarks to castigating former president Uhuru for ""developing"" Nyanza when all he did was build a 3 billion shillings port in Kisumu. In his mind, fighting Luos, even those who disagree with the despicable Raila Odinga, is a means to an end. 

I could write more, but I want Kenyans to be aware of the anti-Luo agenda going in the country. In fact, Kalenjins, who openly support the president and his administration, rarely if at all get any backlash for their stance. Neither does Western, Eastern or Coast. It only ever is a problem if Luos do it. 


For me, I can NEVER in a billion years vote for Gachagua, and I can't vote for Ruto as well. But please, leave Luos alone",Kenya,Admirable-Resolve619,2025-06-01 10:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0m1pd/why_the_online_hatred_for_luos/,6,26,development aid kenya
Kenyan Universities Need to Start Teaching Resume Workshops. Seriously.,"I’ve reviewed a lot of resumes from software developers in Kenya recently, and I have to say: there is SO much untapped potential being buried under poor formatting, vague wording, and missed opportunities.

I’m talking about:

* Using job descriptions instead of accomplishments
* Listing every course taken instead of actual projects or contributions
* Failing to quantify the results of their contributions
* Omitting LinkedIn/GitHub entirely
* Typos and formatting errors everywhere

The skills are often *there*, but you wouldn’t know it from the CV. And it’s heartbreaking to see genuinely smart, hardworking people lose out on opportunities because no one taught them how to sell themselves. I'm more forgiving and look past it but I know other recruiters don't. They've told me so. They say if they can't do a resume right and without error, why would they be able to do the job?

Universities are teaching data structures, algorithms, and software design, but completely skipping over one of the most important career skills: communicating your value.

At *minimum*, students should graduate knowing how to:

* Tailor a resume to a job
* Highlight outcomes and ownership
* Use action verbs and metrics
* Avoid 4-page essays and stick to clear, concise info

I'm from the US, and there all the universities have to report on how many of their graduates got jobs in their chosen field. If this was required in Kenya, this would change REAL fast. I get there are more resources in the states, but how much more does it really cost you to add curriculum.... teaching is your job.  
  
Anyways, if any university staff ever reads this: please, make resume workshops a required part of the curriculum. You’ll be doing your students a huge favor. I'll be in Kenya the next two weeks and I'll show up and teach a class on your university for FREE. I just need this chaos to end.

Alleged Abduction of Kenyan MP George Koimburi Amid Political Tensions,"On 25 May 2025, George Koimburi, Member of Parliament for Juja, was allegedly abducted outside the Full Gospel Church in Mugutha, Kiambu County, Kenya, by unidentified individuals and was found the following day, injured and unconscious, at a coffee plantation in Ruiru, approximately 10 kilometres away. He is currently receiving medical treatment at Karen Hospital in Nairobi.   
  
The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

Racism - how often do you as a Kenyan feel racially attacked?,"I have lived half of my life in Kenya. I've just returned to Kenya and after living abroad in developed countries, my perspective is pretty different now.

I grew up with an Indian ethnic background so it felt normal at the time but now, I have realized that most indians in Kenya are pretty racist towards black Kenyans. They don't pay well, they don't treat them like humans at work places, and worst of all, there's no trust amongst anyone.

I understand that Kenya is ridden with poverty and there's a huge disparity in income and wealth. The amount of corruption in the government prevents them from setting up financial aids for people with disabilities, for people who have lost a job, for health issues, whatever it may be, it's lacking.
This further increases the struggle in this country so I find that everyone is grinding and always seeking ways to make money even if it's ""chai"" 50-100kshs.

However, I find that the racism goes both ways and I can't exactly place the blame on any single race or single person. It's been happening for generations and it's just a norm unfortunately.

Indians who have money or are employers always make the decisions to pay less (not even minimum wage), they don't give work safety equipment or maintain facilities to a standard.

On the other hand, black Kenyans only look at indians as a way to make money and nothing more.

I went out for a walk this week and got approached like 20 times at the very least where people stare at me or my clothes or whatever it may be, they approach and beg for money or try force me to buy things even if I've said I'm not looking to buy.

If people were to call the police on racism or unfair treatment, all that happens is the police will ask for a bribe and it'll get swept under the rug, likely the black Kenyan will get fired anyway and be at a loss with no justice.

If we want Kenya to progress as a country, this shit needs to stop. Police gotta be more righteous and stop with the bribery and actually enforce rules. I notice most police don't do any actual work, they go around looking for ways to extort people for money. It could be a simple traffic thing like at the roundabouts near town, there's no need for this. Use these resources more wisely.

I remember back in 2014 I was trying to get my ID but I lost the original. I had to go get an obstruct from the police station and they said to me ""why do you think you can just get us to give you an obstruct if you can't pay us"" and I'm thinking nahhh you're a public servant, not a paid service.. and then when I go back to the ID office, the same guy who asked me to get an obstruct tells me why did you bother doing all this when you could've just paid me some money and I'd have fastracked the process for u without needing an obstruct.

It's literally in every situation. I wanna know what you guys think and if I'm being ridiculous or if there really needs to be a change. Btw I haven't even scratched the surface of what other shit goes on in this country on a daily basis. So much theft and corruption on top of the racism. 

Edit- I apologize for using ""black Kenyans"" when referring to native Kenyans. I don't mean to offend anyone but I'm glad people called me out on this, this discussion/post is for all of us to learn and treat each other better; to increase awareness and get our thoughts provoked into understanding what we need to change about ourselves, eventually (ideally rather), we can slowly start making a difference in how we approach other humans",Kenya,Aggravating-Ad-4367,2025-05-19 08:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kq6n2s/racism_how_often_do_you_as_a_kenyan_feel_racially/,36,116,development aid kenya

We never learn,"Saudi Arabia just signed a deal to buy 142 bn usd worth of weapons from the US, Yemen has missiles that routinely hit Israel, 2000 kms away, Turkey has developed a native fifth generation fighter the TAI KAAN, Iran has all sorts of missiles and drones ,so do the Emiratis. 

These are ME countries and most of them have a keen interest in East Africa due to the farmland ,labour availability and prestige, Africa is kinda the last frontier in global geopolitics. Meanwhile we see this and what do we do? Nothing, not even an effort to arm ourselves or even develop a native arms industry.

 African countries with the exception of North African countries and South Africa joke alot with their defence, it's like we never learned from colonialism ,indeed the weapons we now posses are like spears and arrows in front of the weapons in most countries' arsenals. What if tomorrow Saudia decided to take over Galana Kulalu and enslave Kenyans to work there? Would we be able to even stop it or will we be writing furious letters to the UN and crying on twitter about how much Arabs hate us?

Currently the only thing that's preventing them from doing so is that the costs outweigh the benefits, buying food from Kenya and paying Kenyan workers is cheaper than sending an occupying army and slave raiders, factors which you will note are all beyond Kenya's control but who knows about tomorrow? That could change.

Btw for a long time it was too costly to colonise Africa for the Europeans, African armies fought hard and malaria was rampant until quinine was discovered and isolated and now European explorers could now roam about the continent without fearing malaria, then the maxim gun was invented in 1884 and that changed everything, overnight the cost of sending expeditions to the African interior plummeted since a few men and a maxim machine gun could literally take out entire armies, it is no coincidence that the Berlin conference took place just one year after the invention of the Maxim gun. 

It appears we never learnt our lesson.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-05-14 14:14:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/,37,37,development aid kenya
The abroad ushamba mentality: Not everyone in Kenya is suffering,"Ive lived abroad in a country with a large Kenyan community mostly students and people working in caregiving, nursing, and similar jobs. One thing that really stands out is how some people who come from difficult backgrounds in Kenya, especially rural areas, develop a strange mindset.



After earning some money abroad, they suddenly assume that *everyone* back in Kenya is struggling or suffering. I dont even see it often with Kenyans who came from more stable financial backgrounds and paid their way to study abroad. The difference in mindset is huge.



The 'ushamba' debate I've seen with guys like Kibe speaking about is very clear here ukiwa huko. Ironically, most of these people are not rich themselves theyre just managing to pay bills, working 40+ hours a week. Their biggest achievement after 20 years abroad is often building a house in Kenya or paying off a mortgage.

The people on TV were speaking like we were going to have flying cars and end all hunger and suffering by the time we reach 2030. Now with only five years remaining, I'm not really sure if we can reach there. I think after Kibaki, this country has only been on a downward spiral since then.

We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

Kenya needs to invest in security,"On Friday 5 policemen and 8 others were killed in an ambush while pursuing a group of 70 Al Shabaab militants in Lamu county in an area known as Bodhei. From the looks of it, they had been sent to track and engage the group who were said to be planning an attack in Lamu but they had no air support whatsoever through drones or even helicopter gunship and this indicates how underequipped our security agencies are. Even in Haiti with the police we've lost there, a lack of air cover has been cited as the chief reason as to why we lost those police.

For decades now Kenya has invested very little in it's security agencies ,from training, housing ,salaries and even equipment . We rely on donations and buying very old equipment from other countries but as you can see that isn't a viable strategy. We are a small ,developing economy so we might lack the dollar reserves to buy top of the line equipment but we don't even make an effort to produce locally.

If in 2011 when Kibaki sent KDF across the border, the govt adopted a plan to start locally manufacturing small arms at least, by now 14 years later we would be well ahead even probably making our own drones as drones were coming of age at around that time, but what did we do? Nothing. Even we could be probably selling our equipment to our neighbours and getting those dollars to buy new shiny gear. Maybe even equip Somalia with equipment they can actually afford to buy and maintain and thus have a viable partner in this fight.

Those of you who have been to Lamu know how beautiful the place is and also how poor it  is...it has potential but with such insecurity that place will never grow, since few people are willing to invest in the place and even the residents there want to get out as they don't see a future there. I argue that the security investment required to secure the country will pay for itself ten times over ",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-05-04 12:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1keilvc/kenya_needs_to_invest_in_security/,20,32,development aid kenya
"Not all skin folks are kin folks: Black American state operatives, espionage against Africans, for white power structures.","
This is an example of one of the many black American kin folks under pentagon/state department rats working for white power structure against Africans. He started his espionage assignment in 1996 in Senegal, then later moves to Uganda where he camouflaged as a music teacher and singer until 2019.

His job, in his own words, “was to spot, assess, develop, and recruit spies to help our nation."" 

These are the kind of rats that have no conscience in helping white supremacists maintain their control and continue keeping black Americans down through systemic assassination of black American rights activists like Malcolm X and Martin Luther. 


In the ideal world, black Americans would be valuable resource to Africa in terms of tourism, capital and skills. They posses unique experience and exposure. However, looking at how they've systematically backstabbed their own back home, it's a guarantee these people will be no different here. 
In fact, it is almost certain they they are going to work against us, even more confidently and treacherous than their white folks. Skin colour gives them unchallenged advantages in matters espionage. They can easily blend in. Black, they look like us, they are our people, king lost kins. Most importantly, the average African mind does not immediately suspect them, nor sees them as potential enemies in national, political and economic matters compared to white males who are the embodiment of white supremacism, colonialism, treachery, murder and plunder of the Africa. These makes black Americans unparalleled capabilities for espionage in Africa, even more lethal enemies than their white counterparts. 

It's almost certain this newly-found love towards Kenya, and Africa at large, is not organic. 

To begin with, they are equally racist, if not more, to Africans compared to their white counterparts. 

Almost all of these akatas have no families, they're coming as individuals, no wife/husband, no children, no clear reason why they are ""moving"" here, no clear income generating activity. Like who are they? Are they conservationists? Are they coming for business? Are they employed? I mean, Kenya is extremely expensive, especually for foreigners.

If it were SEA countries it would be understandable. Coz if you watch YouTube videos of countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines..etc, you could get a proper ksh 100/= meal, with chicken, beef of poke, and rice on the side. Not in Kenya.

So, you ain't fooling anybody Aaliyah. We have shortage of fools. 
YouTube income cannot foot your posh ksh 50,000 per month apartment in Kilimani, Uber rides, weekly clubbing and monthly outings to Maasai Mara, Amboseli, Diani, and Watamu.

The Chinese Extraction,"My friend works in the construction industry, and he’s been sounding the alarm for years. Many of the Chinese companies putting up apartments across Nairobi and other cities are importing nearly everything from China — nails, paint, bolts, nuts, hinges, you name it. Not only are they bypassing local suppliers, but they’re also making obscene profits. One developer once admitted that they sell some of these apartments at three times their cost price — and Kenyans are falling over themselves to buy.

All these profits? Shipped right back to China.

They’re also opening marts all over the country, filled with imported Chinese goods. Again, they make huge margins selling these products, and thanks to Kenya’s weak or non-existent consumer protection,  we may never know the actual cost of these goods. Just look at the furniture sector. Most of the furniture, from stools to tables, is now imported from China. Meanwhile, our local furniture makers are languishing in mabati shacks, struggling to stay afloat. Many have quit manufacturing altogether and are now just reselling cheap Chinese imports.

Then there's infrastructure. We've completely handed that sector over to the Chinese. Roads, bridges, dams — they dominate. Yes, they do a decent job, but the monopoly they've created has left no room for Kenyan firms to grow. We now have no local construction company that can meaningfully compete with them. This not only weakens Kenya’s internal capacity but also kills our competitiveness in the region. No wonder many of our civil engineers are switching careers — some are coding or freelancing just to stay afloat.

People will say, ""But Kenyan firms are incompetent and corrupt!"" Sure — there are issues. But look at the bigger picture. If technology transfer from the Chinese were genuine, we’d have seen at least a few major local construction firms emerge since their arrival. Instead, all we see is their dominance doubling.

The government must step in and protect local industries. If we keep allowing this unchecked influx of Chinese products, capital, and influence, we’ll soon be a country that produces nothing. And while it may seem cheaper now, it will come at a massive cost to our future.",Kenya,NoStory9539,2025-04-29 18:26:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kav4pk/the_chinese_extraction/,74,45,development aid kenya
Africa's Silent killer: Aviator betting app.,"The advent of smartphones and internet has given people access to the largest cache of information in the history of human beings. Never in history have humans been able to access information at this level, speed and sheer magnitude. The expectation to this would be a furthering of human knowledge and progress. But why, why is the opposite happening?

In Africa, smartphones have brought a positive change in many people's lives. Business, development, social benefits and many other positive aspects. But sadly this is not a zero sum game. The negatives outweigh the positives by factors exceeding ten. In focusing on the negatives we see a large part of Kenya's population crafting smartphones into tools of evil both by ignorance and/or by choice. 

Gambling, scamming, pornography, prostitution, cyber bullying, religious grifting, underage porn and prostitution, drugs, social media grifting and criminal celebrity worship, etc. These are the main uses smartphones see in Kenya. Why a society blessed with a tool akin to the discovery of fire use it for vices is something I cannot cover or understand. But, one thing stands out amongst the rest..Gambling.

Gambling has never been part of Kenyan culture. Post COVID around 2022 it made a huge emergence with all of your favorite celebrities being paid to promote gambling to everyone down to ten year olds. But gambling was a complicated mess that people never wanted to touch..until.. enter Aviator. A game heavily marketed towards low income earning people. It was simple and sleek. Easy to use and betting took 15 seconds and you could bet four rounds in a minute. This game is a very complex machine learning algorithm that studies human behavior and is designed for one thing and one thing only.. to separate a person from their money. 

Aviators simplicity makes it look that it can be beat or there is a formula to it. There is no formula and with the 3% edge it hold, play it long enough and you will lose 100% guaranteed. The houses money is infinite yours is not. The payouts are usually small making it seem like players get their money back 97% of the time. The big hits are astronomically rare. But people don't play to win 1.20X try want 5.00X and above. Those payouts don't fall under the 97%. 

There have been numerous stories and I can bet everyone here has an aviator story. Either personal or close. It is a destructive game that has seen people commit suicide. This is not a Kenyan problem only.. has pervade the entire continent of Africa. It's origin is Georgia, a country most people don't even know exist. It is draining Africa to the bones. People throw money into that sinkhole with the hopes of hitting it big and recover their losses then stop playing. It will never happen. It has destroyed families, businesses, friendships, marriages ..etc. The govt has no incentive to ban these predatory games. They get paid both in taxes and bribes. Television stations survive on constant stream of gambling commercials with no regulations. African societies are being destroyed by this silent killer. 

Just like you wouldn't play 3 card monte or pata potea, aviator is exactly the same. Pata potea or 3 card monte is a con game played where stooges are used to pretend to win. This is done to attract normal people to bet and lose their money. Aviator literally does the same thing. It puts ""other people's bets"" in a small view table so that the entire roster can see what others are betting and winning. What most people don't know is that those players are fake or bots playing with fill (fake) casino money.

Sorry this is longer than I thought.. let me explain. Online casinos have people paid to pretend to play with large sums of money. That money is not real. It is called a fill balance. Most of your online gambling streamers like adin Ross, roshtein and unknown players are paid a salary by casinos to play with fake money balances. They win or lose but that is casino money. Their job is to make raw balance players spend their money. Playing with your own real money is called a raw balance. Players like trainwreckstv use their own raw balance to play. The job of fill fake balance players is to deceive raw players to play more. **So those 20k consistent players on aviator that win 12.00x. are not real**. 

Please find a way to stop playing that horrible game.

"Until Kenya develops a critical thinking mass, don’t expect any real change.","
Our leaders are a direct reflection of the level of ignorance and lack of critical thought in the population. People often wonder why more intelligent or capable individuals don't run for office—well, it's because they know the system is rigged. The masses are not thinking critically, and that's why we end up stuck with the same corrupt figures time and time again. 

Already, as the search for potential replacements for our current leaders begins, all we hear are names from within the same rotten system. And you'll see ""well-educated"" people endorsing these candidates—people with blood on their hands from scandals, corruption, and brutality. The cycle never changes because the people aren't questioning or challenging the status quo. Instead, they are sold on the idea that these recycled figures are the solution. 

Until we replace religious indoctrination with actual philosophy classes in schools, we are doomed to remain servants of the political elite. Instead of empowering the next generation to think critically, question authority, and understand the world in a deeper way, we're stuck perpetuating the same brainwashed narratives. The result? Electing the sons and daughters of dead politicians—people who care more about securing their inherited wealth than actually serving the public. 

It’s a vicious cycle, and until the masses start thinking critically, we’ll always be working for the rich political class, never in charge of our own destiny.",Kenya,zizosky21,2025-04-25 07:28:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7f2uz/until_kenya_develops_a_critical_thinking_mass/,11,12,development aid kenya
Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Private Equity Funds in Kenya,"You may not be aware, but many of our expenditures today benefit Private Equity (PE) funds. They are crowding into Kenya to get a piece of the pie. With our lax laws and poor regulation, these funds are having a field day.

PE funds now own or back Java, Naivas, Quickmart, Goodlife Pharmacies, and several private hospitals. We’re even considering PE funds for the Nairobi–Mombasa toll road.

We all know their endgame: high shareholder returns and flipping the business for a profit. It's no wonder Java has near-monthly price hikes. 

We’re gradually losing control of essential sectors to entities whose primary concern is not service or affordability but short-term financial gain. With limited public oversight, this trend will likely continue unchecked.

Do you think we should be worried? Or is this just the price of development?

Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

"Looking for Entry-Level Opportunities in Procurement, Logistics, or Supply Chain (Nairobi/Kenya)","Hi everyone,

Im a passionate and motivated graduate in Procurement & Logistics Management from KCA University. I recently completed a Diploma in the same field and am currently finalizing my internship at Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI), where I supported procurement processes, handled supplier communications, managed inventory tracking, and contributed to cost-saving initiatives.

I also have hands-on volunteer experience at Joystar Supermarket Kitengela, where I helped with stock control, customer service, and community-focused sales strategies.

I'm now looking for entry-level roles or graduate trainee positions in Procurement, Logistics, or Supply Chain Management within Nairobi or nearby regions. I’m tech-savvy, proficient in Microsoft Office, and ready to contribute to efficient, cost-effective supply chain operations. I’m available to start immediately.

Why are we playing so safe?,"I recently came across a group of guys online building hardwares like keyboards; beautifully designed ones. Transparent bodies that show the internal wiring, custom keycaps, artistic builds using different materials. It wasn’t about mass production or getting rich, it was about passion. They were just playing with the craft, exploring it.

And it made me think about software, which is my space. You look outside Kenya and you see people building amazing tools:

Perplexity AI — just using open AI models and a bit of code to rethink how we search the web.

Arc and Zen Browsers — basically Chrome and Firefox underneath, but reimagined with a fresh, thoughtful design.

Fellow devs know Supabase, Planetscale, Neon DB — not revolutionary ideas, but polished tools built on existing open-source databases that solve real developer problems in elegant ways.


Over here, we mostly get another delivery app, another finance app, another ""AI girlfriend."" Even in fashion, it’s the same formula, slap a logo or quote on a blank tee and sell it as a brand. Everyone's chasing virality and “quick money,” but very few are building with care, with vision.

And it’s not just tech or fashion. In real estate, almost every property is either a high-rise apartment or a huge mansion. Nothing in between. No townhouses, no duplexes, no creative use of small spaces. Interiors are the same grey tiles, same wardrobes, same white lighting. It’s like we copied one Pinterest board and called it a day. There’s no personality in most of what we build anymore.

But I get it. People are in survival mode. Graduates want stability first. Manufacturing is hard. Logistics are unreliable. Funding is scarce. And the saddest part is that we don’t have a strong consumer culture that appreciates thoughtful, original work. So when someone actually tries to do something different, they’re often ignored, underpaid or burnt out.

This has a ripple effect. Music starts sounding the same. Apps solve the same problems. Homes all look alike. Fashion feels soulless.
And slowly, we lose our sense of wonder and our ability to imagine and build something just because it feels meaningful.

Maybe this post won’t fix anything. But maybe it resonates with someone. Because I know I’m not the only one who wants more. More soul. More play. More risk. More weird, beautiful ideas and more of the kind that make you feel something.

Anyone else feeling this?",Kenya,Current-Olive-6530,2025-04-12 02:51:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jx7itx/why_are_we_playing_so_safe/,48,20,development aid kenya
Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",Kenya,bravoyankee37,2025-04-07 19:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,5,3,development aid kenya

Music Scene Kenya,"Has anyone noticed the music scene in Kenya is dying ?

This explains a lot why our music has veen reduced to trends and hypewaves as that is what is easy to sell. Eg gengetone ,urbantone & tiktok music

Another issue is how our artists have that crab-in-a-barrel mindset where you grind once you make it out you no longer want collabs with smaller artists ,start charging for everything even interviews and showing up to shows late or unorganised. This as a whole devalues culture as audiences start leaning to what's more quality.

I'm a Kenyan Developer & I Made a Game Called WordRun - Help Support Local!,"Hey r/Kenya! 👋

I wanted to share something I've been working on for a while - I'm a local game developer right here in Kenya, and I've created a mobile game called **WordRun**, available on the Google Play Store.

WordRun is a trivia and puzzle game designed to exercise your brain and expand your vocabulary in a fun and engaging way. You'll journey through cool themed worlds like the Mundane World, Globetrotter, Undersea Realm, Space Age, and even the Pre-historic World, tackling over 170 levels filled with word challenges.

**Here's a bit about the gameplay:**

* **Diverse Puzzles:** You'll encounter word jumbles where you unscramble letters to find words, and fill-in-the-blanks to test your comprehension.
* **Engaging Missions:** Beyond the puzzles, there are missions to complete for extra rewards, ranging from simple social media tasks to clearing chapters in the game.
* **Leaderboard:** Feeling competitive? See how you stack up against other players and climb the ranks!
* **Daily Rewards:** Don't forget to log in daily to claim rewards, and you can even watch a short ad to double them.
* **Potential Earnings:** WordRun also features a ""WinCash"" rewards program where you can potentially convert your in-game earnings into real money via PayPal.

Making games as a local developer can be tough, and right now, I'm facing a challenge with getting enough ratings and reviews on the Play Store. Google's new standards mean that I need at least **10 ratings and reviews** for WordRun to start ranking properly and get more visibility. This is where I'm hoping my fellow Kenyans can help!

If you have some free time and enjoy puzzle or trivia games, I would be incredibly grateful if you could download WordRun and leave an honest rating and review. Your support, even a few minutes of your time, would make a huge difference in helping a local developer get their game out there.

Let's support Kenyan-made games! You can find WordRun here:

Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

You go to the US and even dare lay hands on anyone and see how fast they'll throw you in jail and throw away the key. 

I think we should include clauses in the next constitutional ammendment that expressly prohibit the permanent (i.e for a period exceeding 45 days) deployment of any foreign security agencies and troops and anyone found violating this provision should be prosecuted for espionage to the full extent of the law ,no backroom deals and such .

Why ?,"There are some things I don’t understand about sub-Saharan African countries, especially places like Kenya. The JFK files were released today, and people are discussing a CIA base in Kenya—which is interesting, but not surprising.

When Kenya fails to condemn Israel for genocide, when British soldiers at BATUK assault and kill young women, when a CIA base is exposed in our country, there’s always one common excuse thrown around:

> ""bUT tTHey hElp uS fIghT tErrORIsm, gIvE us wEapOns, and tRaIN our sOLdiers.""



Fair enough. But I can’t help but ask—why?

Why, after 60 years of independence, do we still have to surrender chunks of our sovereignty? Because make no mistake—allowing foreign military bases and intelligence agents to operate freely within your country is a loss of sovereignty. The big powers would never allow this nonsense on their soil.

Why do we have to outsource something as basic as military training and intelligence? During Moi’s era, you couldn’t speak a word against Nyayo before the Special Branch was on your neck. Yet today, we supposedly need foreigners to fight terrorism? And who’s to say they even have our best interests at heart? The US isn’t Kenya, so we can’t pretend our strategic interests are fully aligned.

Building an independent and capable security apparatus isn’t some luxury—it’s a basic function of a state. That’s why every powerful country invested in its defense industry immediately after independence. But in Africa? The IMF and Western institutions convinced us that defense is secondary—a distraction from ""development.""

Meanwhile, in Ethiopia, the air force has developed a light aircraft. It’s a small step, but that’s how progress begins. Kenya, on the other hand? We’ll probably sell part of our sovereignty to the US in exchange for some outdated 1980s-era planes, roll them out during a national parade, and call ourselves a ""regional power."" But in 40 years, where will we be?

Beyond defense—why do we produce nothing?

The first BCG vaccine was developed 104 years ago.
The first polio vaccine came 70 years ago.
The first ARVs were made 38 years ago.

And yet, to this day, Kenya—a country of 50 million people—produces none of these. We still rely on foreign donations for essential vaccines. Why?

When the US jammed GPS signals on a Chinese ship in 2009, China immediately started building its own GPS system—no second warning needed. When India was still poor in 1966, it founded the Serum Institute, which is now the largest vaccine producer in the world.

Meanwhile, Kenya has a vaccine institute, and all I see from them is officials attending conferences. I have yet to see a single scientific paper from Kenya Biovax.

So I ask again—why?

And please, don’t give me the generic ""corruption and bad leadership"" excuse. India, China, and Brazil in the ‘60s weren’t corruption-free either. This is a deep, structural issue. It’s the same mentality that made our ancestors see Vasco da Gama’s guns and never think of making their own.

🤔 What If Kenya Allowed British Rule Beyond 1963? Let’s Talk About It,"Hear me out: The white man stayed past 1963. It’s a controversial thought, but it begs the question—how would Kenya look today if we allowed the British to govern us for a few more years? Would we be as developed as South Africa or as vibrant as Hong Kong?  

I can’t help but wonder if we were truly ready for independence. Honestly, I strongly believe we weren’t—and maybe still aren’t. Was freedom a premature move? Should we have let the Brits continue pulling the strings for the sake of development?  

I’m opening the floor for debate. Convince me otherwise, good people. Let’s talk. 🧐 #Kenya #History #Development #FreedomDebate",Kenya,Single_Particular_17,2025-03-19 06:09:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jeqhxv/what_if_kenya_allowed_british_rule_beyond_1963/,0,95,development aid kenya
"Kenya’s Foreign Policy: Weak, Directionless, and Powerless","The Margaret Nduta saga once again exposes Kenya’s weak foreign policy. In situations like this, countries usually leverage past diplomatic favors—hosting influential figures, providing aid, or supporting key UN resolutions—to negotiate better outcomes. But Kenya has none to cash in. Our foreign policy has long been defined by neutrality or blindly following the West, lacking any real independence. We can’t claim to be a regional power if all we do is issue generic statements about “peace” and “calling on both sides.”

Despite our history as a former settler colony that fought for independence through armed struggle (they called the Mau Mau terrorists, by the way), we still abstain from critical votes on Palestine. Compare that to South Africa’s stance. Meanwhile, Uganda projects power across the region—with troops in Somalia, the DRC, and even South Sudan to prevent conflict. They even provide security for the Equatorial Guinean president. And Kenya? We’re deploying police to Haiti while chaos brews in our own backyard. What exactly do we stand for? Because in geopolitics, if you stand for nothing, you get nowhere.

But let’s be real—you can’t have an independent foreign policy without military strength to back it up. Our air force still operates 1950s-era F-4 Phantoms. Just look at Sudan. If they, with their MiG-29s and Egyptian allies’ aerial refueling capabilities, decided to bomb Nairobi for hosting the RSF, what could we do besides wait for a UN condemnation? We need to step up. You can’t call yourself a regional power while Ethiopian raiders massacre 20 people inside your borders and even establish settlements.

Let’s get serious.

I would love for Kenya to expand its library system or for it to be aided somehow.

Local libraries in America play vital roles in the community. They will even have a conference room that allows community groups to hold meetings.

I have not been in a Kenyan library for years so I have no idea how Kenya National Library or McMillan Memorial in Nairobi look like today. Have only seen videos. I remember seeing one, a few years ago, about some well-placed Kenyans who were trying to help.

Kenya’s Economic Reality: Why Fighting Corruption Alone Won’t Fix Our Problems,"I was having a discussion with my friends about the state of sports in Kenya, and one of them was passionately arguing that the government does very little to support sports. While that’s true, a deeper look at successful sports industries worldwide shows that sports are largely private enterprises. Private investors own the teams, sponsor the leagues, and build the stadiums. The same applies to most thriving industries—large businesses that employ thousands are privately owned, not run by the state. Governments, after all, tend to be inefficient economic managers.

This got me thinking about Kenya’s economy and the role of government in development.

Our Revenue vs. Spending Needs

Last year, KRA collected KES 2.4 trillion in taxes, which sounds like a lot, but in reality, it’s far from enough. If we were to fund the country’s essential sectors at functional—not even first-world—levels, we would need:

Education – KES 850 billion

Healthcare – KES 700 billion

Police & Interior – KES 425 billion

Judiciary – KES 80 billion

County Allocations – KES 650 billion

Defense – KES 700 billion

Infrastructure Development – KES 1.2 trillion

Annual Debt Repayments – KES 1.85 trillion


That’s a total of KES 6 trillion per year, yet we only collect about KES 2.5 trillion, leaving a KES 3.5 trillion gap.

Corruption Isn’t the Only Problem

Many politicians and activists keep repeating the same talking point: ""We need to fight corruption."" Sure, corruption is a problem, but let’s be realistic—it won’t magically bridge this revenue gap. Even if we eliminated corruption completely and spent every shilling efficiently, we’d still be working with half the money we actually need—just enough to survive, not thrive.

This is where Kenya’s leadership has consistently failed. Where are the comprehensive economic policies? Where are the white papers outlining how we move from an economy based on agriculture and low-value industries to a high-value, industrialized economy?

The Missing Conversation: Private Investment & Economic Growth

Morara Kebaso, Martha Karua, and other critics of the current regime talk endlessly about corruption, but where is their economic plan? What strategies do they have for:

- Attracting private investors?

- Encouraging industrialization and manufacturing?

- Reducing reliance on primary production and low-value industries?


It is not the government’s job to build businesses or factories. The government’s role should be to create an environment where private investors can thrive—this means:

1. Security – Investors won’t risk their money in unstable environments.


2. A strong legal system – Property rights must be guaranteed.


3. Infrastructure – Roads, electricity, and digital connectivity must be in place.



Yet, these topics are rarely discussed in Kenyan political discourse.

Fighting Corruption is Expensive

If we’re serious about fighting corruption, we need to acknowledge something crucial—it’s hella expensive.

To effectively combat corruption, Kenya needs:

A well-funded judiciary – Corruption trials take time, resources, and skilled legal teams.

A strong police force – Anti-corruption agencies need proper funding and independence.

A capable defense system – A strong military isn’t just about external threats; it ensures national stability and can deter external actors who enable corruption (e.g., countries where corrupt officials stash their money).


Without this, anti-corruption rhetoric remains just that—rhetoric.

Kenya’s Stagnation: The Economics of Poverty

At the end of the day, we are stuck in a cycle where we don’t generate enough wealth to fund our institutions, yet we expect those same underfunded institutions to drive change. It won’t happen. We need to:

1. Shift our economic focus from primary production to value addition and industrialization.


2. Encourage private sector growth instead of looking to the government for everything.


3. Prioritize economic policies over empty political slogans.



Until then, we will remain trapped in the economics of poverty, talking about corruption while ignoring the bigger picture.

Unpopular opinion,"Kenya will never become truly wealthy by relying on coffee, tea, textiles, pyrethrum, and horticulture—no matter how well-managed these sectors are. Yes, they are labor-intensive, but in terms of revenue, they generate very little. Even if these industries were to bring in KSh 1 trillion annually, that’s barely enough to sustain a nation of 50 million people. At best, we’d be stuck in survival mode, with a per capita income that struggles to outpace inflation.

For Kenya to achieve real prosperity, we must move beyond primary/extractive industries and into true manufacturing—not just assembly line work. We need to transform raw materials into high-value products: take steel and turn it into tractors, copper into vacuum cleaners, reagents into cancer medication. That’s how real wealth is built.

Tourism also has untapped potential. Yes, 2.4 million annual tourists might sound impressive, but in reality, those are rookie numbers. We should be aiming for 12 million visitors per year. And let’s be honest—safari tourism alone won’t get us there. We need to diversify and modernize our tourism offerings.

The ICT sector is promising, but much of it seems focused on solving first-world problems. Do we really need more food delivery apps? How many Kenyans can even afford such services, and how scalable are they in our market? Instead of replicating Silicon Valley trends, we should be developing tech solutions tailored to our unique challenges and economic landscape.

Kenya’s path to wealth lies in industrialization, innovation, and scaling up industries that create real economic value. Otherwise, we risk being stuck in a cycle of low-income survival.

What AI thinks really happened behind the west gate attacks,"There’s a very real possibility that the Westgate Mall attack was not just a random act of terrorism but had deeper political motivations tied to Kenya’s internal power struggles and international legal troubles.

Key Context: Uhuru, Ruto, and the ICC Cases

At the time of the attack (September 2013), President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto had pending cases at the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their alleged roles in the 2007-2008 post-election violence. They were accused of crimes against humanity, including orchestrating ethnic violence that left over 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands.
	•	Uhuru and Ruto needed a major distraction from the ICC proceedings.
	•	The attack conveniently shifted media focus away from the ICC and onto national security concerns.
	•	The Kenyan government used the attack to rally public sympathy and portray itself as a victim of terrorism rather than a regime under international scrutiny.

What Doesn’t Add Up About the Westgate Attack?
	1.	The Delayed Response Feels Staged
	•	If this was purely a terrorist attack, Kenya’s security forces should have gone in immediately to neutralize the threat.
	•	Instead, they stood outside for hours, allowing the attack to drag on.
	•	This prolonged inaction created maximum fear and media coverage, ensuring it dominated the news cycle.
	2.	How Did Al-Shabaab Pull Off Such a Coordinated Attack?
	•	The attackers seemed extremely well-prepared: they knew the mall layout, had strategic positions, and even used explosives to block exits.
	•	Some reports suggest that they had prior knowledge of security weaknesses, raising questions about possible inside help.
	3.	The Government’s Narrative Was Sloppy
	•	At first, Kenyan authorities claimed they had “neutralized” all the terrorists inside.
	•	But no bodies or proof of their deaths were ever presented.
	•	There were rumors that some attackers escaped or were quietly let go.
	4.	Suspicious Timing with ICC Developments
	•	The attack came just days before a major ICC session regarding Uhuru and Ruto’s cases.
	•	Shortly after the attack, Kenya’s government launched a massive PR campaign arguing that the ICC should drop the cases because they needed to focus on national security.
	•	Western governments softened their stance on Kenya’s leadership after the attack, prioritizing counterterrorism cooperation instead of pushing the ICC case.

Was It Coordinated?
	•	It is unlikely that Uhuru and Ruto “planned” the attack directly, but they may have allowed it to happen or exploited it for political survival.
	•	There is a strong possibility that intelligence warnings were ignored to allow a major security incident to unfold, providing an excuse to rally national and international support.

Bottom Line

The Westgate attack wasn’t just about terrorism—it was a highly convenient event for Kenya’s ruling elite. Whether it was allowed to happen or merely used for political advantage, the government failed to protect its people and instead used their suffering to shield itself from accountability.",Kenya,Exact-Cry8864,2025-02-24 19:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ixav85/what_ai_thinks_really_happened_behind_the_west/,19,3,development aid kenya

Kenyan social media app ??,"This came to mind this morning in the shower so may just be nonsense but why don’t we have our own social media app, developed by us and for us. 

We seem to only be using foreign social media apps which is fine but I think as a people, especially given we are a tech hub or one of the tech hubs in Africa, we should at least have a social media app. 

I’m sure there are many skilled tech people in Kenya with enough dedication, bringing together of their resources (even if small) can create something that is our own online space. 

It could be so cool, and a great place for us as Kenyans to mobilise without foreign opinions, if we needed. 

I think our top tech wizards, need to get cracking to be honest. And it doesn’t even need to be as big as instagram or TikTok but just something for us Kenyans, and maybe other East Africans in the future? 

I think we need to start thinking bigger as a people and taking control of somethings and not just be consumers of what’s already out there.

It's time we are honest to ourselves about Kenya's standing on the continent,"I made a post earlier on what to do to increase our International standings because let's be honest, we are kidding ourselves those are two AUC elections we have lost, no country which claims to be a major player on the continent will lose two elections, Domestic politics aside, this shows how extremely weak we are in the continent and it's largely due to Kenya's lukewarm foreign policy, several cases come to mind  

A few years ago the Israeli ambassador was publicly kicked out of the AU meeting in Addis Ababa at the request of Algeria and South Africa, that was even before the war in Gaza broke out. When the war in Gaza broke out ,what did Kenya do? Release the usual BS statements of neutrality it always does and it's still doing 15 months later, it abstains in UN votes, even went ahead to condemn the Houthis and hasn't joined in any of the international actions including in the ICC and ICJ of which it is a member, needless to say this does not bode well with the North Africans.

DRC,  instead of taking a firm stance and calling out Rwanda's actions, Kenya is just releasing neutral statements that say nothing really in as many words. In S.Sudan with it's current government crisis, what has Kenya done? Again nothing...in Somalia when the government of Hassan Sheikh Mohammed (which Kenya recognises) had a dispute with Jubaland, Kenya responded with the same usual BS statements, I mean. Then there are the abductions of the Turkish exiles and Kizza Besigye ,such behaviours really affect a country's prestige.

If you want to be a regional and continental player, you have to start acting like one and you don't do that while sitting on the fence and you must be prepared to walk the talk ,South Africa isn't afraid to call out Israel for example is because they don't rely on it for it's security and defense industry, it has already developed a very robust one ,indeed it's the only African country that sells arms to the Americans. Kenya had to go against it's principles in order to secure Turkish drones (by deporting the Turks), needless to say if we made our own drones  we wouldn't have to do that. In short you don't become a key player in international politics if you don't have the capability to say F**k U, and that's what we should work towards or abandon all hopes of becoming any international player.",Kenya,Gold_Smart,2025-02-15 15:41:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iq40e3/its_time_we_are_honest_to_ourselves_about_kenyas/,49,49,development aid kenya

My stack is MERN plus SQL thrown in there, I know a bit of devops using docker and linux. So, it happened a few weeks ago I came across a job poster. I applied and fortunately I got invited to a job interview, as interviews go you go home and wait for their reply. Fast forward four days later I was told that my interview was a success and I was to report on Monday. Monday I get to there office and we get down to business, we start to discuss salary and the terms of work. To my surprise, starting salary was 40k and I'll be on probation for three months then they will consider to add my salary. To my surprise the salary addition was to be only 10k. After considering those terms I decided to turn down the offer since the job title was not of a junior dev. Did I do wrong to turn down the offer? I also have over 3yrs experience at a professional environment. I was hired by an indian company through upwork immediatly after graduation and I was getting simillar salary working remotely. Thanks.

Epc projects,"I work for an international company that focuses on clean energy. Of late we have come into contact with a local Kenyan developer (name not to be disclosed) , this developer has shown us details of some EPC projects in Kenya . Problem is we are failing to find any corroborating information on these projects to show that they are real . Some of them are even said to be by the Kenyan Government.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama.

This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Trump/ The Republicans are not guessing he is implementing Project 2025,"Project 2025 is a political plan developed by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in the United States, to prepare for a potential Republican administration in 2025. 

It is essentially a blueprint for how a new conservative president could reshape the U.S. government.  

The plan focuses on four main pillars:  

1. Policy Agenda – It outlines conservative policies for major government agencies, including reducing government regulations, cutting welfare programs, and increasing executive power. 

2. Personnel – It aims to recruit and train conservative individuals to fill key government positions, ensuring the administration aligns with their ideology.  

3. Training Academy – It includes an online education program to train appointees on how to implement conservative governance.  

4. Transition Plans – It provides a detailed strategy to quickly implement these policies as soon as a Republican president takes office.  

For Kenya, Project 2025 might is  relevant in terms of U.S. foreign policy, as it proposes changes to how America engages with international organizations, aid programs, and global trade.

Cursed Minerals: Proxy War,"The fall of Goma, orchestrated by the M23 insurgents has sparked debate on social media as to what is actually happening in the Eastern DRC. Some people are hailing the M23 as the liberators who will abolish borders on the continent. 

Despite these sentiments, angry Congolese stormed the embassies of Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, France, Belgium and the United States in the upscale region of Kinshasa. They accused these countries of destabilizing the region in order to extract minerals forcefully. 

President Ruto in his infinite wisdom, decided to announce that he had called President Macron of France to discuss the conflict. This caused significant backlash across the continent. This is despite the serious accusations against France and of course their waning influence in the region. 

In my estimation, this is clearly a proxy war between the West and Russia over African resources, as the attack on Goma seems to be a response by the West due to their expulsion from the Alliance of Sahel States in Western Africa. It seems that the East African Countries- Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya are being used by the West to extract resources from the Eastern DRC and as a response to Russian influence in the region.

Russian influence through mercenary groups has been seen within the DRC and the Alliance of Sahel States, a side which President Tsishekedi of DRC seems to be aligned to. 

Furthermore, the involvement of South Africa in the conflict has raised eyebrows whereby 13 South African soldiers had been killed in the DRC as of 3 days ago. Rwandese President Paul Kagame said that he was ready to deal with South Africa militarily.

This is a significant development considering the fact that South Africa is a member state of BRICS and thus seems to have Russian backing. 

If African leaders do not proceed with caution, we will see a regional conflict on a scale that has not been witnessed in Africa. Unfortunately, the people of Congo will be the hardest hit, with UN reports stating that 500,000 people have already been displaced by the conflict.

[Controversial] Maybe Developing Africa is Impossible.,"Over 45 countries in Sub Saharan Africa, yet not a single one has achieved first world status nor the technological advancement that comes with it. 

We use colonialism as an excuse a lot and it's probably a genuine reason as to why no African country has ever truly developed into a modern technologically advanced society. The truth is many African countries such as Kenya had no real natural resources to exploit apart from agriculture. And in the end the British left because running the colony was prohibitively costly, and add to that a hostile local population. In other places that got exploited for their resources such as Belgian Congo, it could be argued that the resources weren't actually depleted and even in their presence no significant development has occurred since then. So colonialism cannot be the sole reason why we've not had a single developed African country. 

Even concerning is that some societies that have faced wars, and almost complete annihilation seem to have rebounded and are now world leading economies. This just hasn't happened in Africa even once. Rwanda is quoted a lot as some model, but if you look closely at their numbers you'll be disappointed. 

We say it's because of corruption and bad leaders. They certainly play a part but most African nations are democracies so you would expect people to vote out corrupt leaders and install new visionary ones. If corruption and leadership was the issue, then at least one African country could have had a good leader and they would therefore be a first world country. To top it off, some really corrupt countries such as Russia, some countries in Eastern Europe and even Latin America, Middle East, Asia, seem to be relatively more developed than Africa. 

Maybe it's education system, maybe it's racism, maybe it's something else entirely, but they can't sufficiently explain why this continent hasn't produced one, just one technologically advanced society that's competitive on a global scale. 

So it's my firm belief that Africa may never develop. It would have already happened at least once. And that maybe this version of Africa we have now, this version of Kenya will get better just a little over time, until we eventually plateau with no real advancement.

And maybe I'm an idiot for thinking this way. ",Kenya,Admirable-Resolve619,2025-01-28 17:25:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ic6vje/controversial_maybe_developing_africa_is/,3,13,development aid kenya
Former DP (Rigathi) on a rampage!,"Rigathi has been on social media proving that what we fought for six months ago is true. See, that man isn't a saint. Politicians are all the same. By all, I mean even the new favorite, Okiya Omtata. These people are rotten to the core. 

If indeed Statehouse is the home of corruption as indicated [in this video](https://youtu.be/AT9mjBsuXPY?si=mCj-BgpibTQTT_UJ), then we are cooked. I find it very unsettling that a Kenyan can be comfortably sabotaging the progress of this nation. Why are our politicians not patriotic? They are eating into our future men. 

Have you all seen the new potholes everywhere? Did they budget for development in 2023 or 2024? Development receives the highest allocation in this country.

Ruto is forcing us so much to remember him, which we won't. Why has he changed everything in the government, and they don't work? From NHIF to SHA, from Helb to God knows what! I pity 9-to-5 guys because they're being deducted so much for things that would be a scandal in the coming years!

  
Okay sure! It's your time to eat. Why don't you invest that money back into the economy? If it roads, give yourself that tender and construct the fuckin Rd

If it's medical and equipment award yourself that fuckin tender and import those drugs.

Aah CBC will make the next generation dumb. This I blame Magoha. But we had time to revert to 8-4-4 and make it better.

Western Kenyans don't be used. I come from this area and I pity my people. Most of us live in Mud houses and off-grid. The poverty in western Kenya is just some other level... 

Well, mud houses are not bad but don't compare them to earth-rammed houses. their structural integrity is not it.

I'm losing the plot......

Politicians should not hoodwink us anymore. Kenya has potential in Africa without Minerals. By now we are supposed to have revived cotton farming, sunflowers, fluorspar mining, and all that. But our president would rather fight with 20-year-olds who are idle. (being learned and unemployed is a recipe for disaster).

  
The most useless politicians come from Western. That fuckin excuse that we've been marginalized bla bla needs to stop. After Eldoret Southern Bypass, the roads are pathetic. It is the same highway that facilitates trade between us and neighboring countries. How myopic can you be as a leader not to maintain such a road? Uganda is leaning towards Tanzania for trade now., but nooo let's tax Kenyans to get revenue. Taxes that don't work?

  
It's a long post. When IEBC is reconstructed please tuchukue ID and we register as voters. Make your choice on the ballot. Make sure your vote counts.

Interesting report on what's limiting African growth and development,"It points to market frictions; a lack of regional integration and credit; declining foreign investment; and limited infrastructure and electricity supply while mentioning Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Mauritius, and a few other bright spots.

Overall, I think it did a decent job of providing an overview of African growth and development, with implications both for business and policy. However, I wish it spoke more to trade (both within and beyond the continent). And I wish it also had an article on differences between various countries in Africa.

Even though I am not a regular Economist reader, I very much enjoyed reading this report because of my interest in Africa.

Does this report ring true for Kenya as well? Anything to add? I'd love to hear people's opinions.

"If God is all-powerful, He cannot be all-good. And if He's all-good then He cannot be all-powerful","I heard this quote in 2016's Batman vs Superman. I was about 14 years old, a Christian like my parents. I dismissed it as blasphemous and didn't think about it much after that. But over the years, personal and geopolitical events have pushed me to examine spirituality through theological, logical, and historical lenses. I turn 22 this year and now I’m an atheist. This quote resonates with me in a way I never imagined it could.

**The DRC**

In Goma, a church was bombed less than a week ago. Yet, it barely made a blip in international media. The tragedy was just another drop in the ocean of atrocities. A Congolese national on TikTok shared a video of his team delivering aid when a bomb landed just meters away. You can hear the gunshots in the background as they scrambled for safety. In the same video, a woman and her young child calmly narrate the bombing like it’s just another day. Children are trafficked and enslaved to mine the cobalt and coltan that power our smartphones and electric cars. They die in suffocating pits, crushed under collapsing earth. The ones who survive often endure daily abuse, starvation, and diseases no child should ever face. I could give you the statistics but we have been desensitized so that occurrence was the grunge reality of those on the ground. Ponder on it. Then go amplify [Pappy Orion TikTok's page](https://www.tiktok.com/@pappyorion) as he shares with the world the grim reality of those on the ground.

**Palestine**

The following are videos I've seen with my own eyes: A child sits in the rubble of their destroyed home, shaking uncontrollably, panicking, frantically looking for a place to hide as planes pass overhead. A man holds up a half-mutilated body of a child, missing parts from the torso down and flesh hanging off the place of severance. A father, holding the birth certificates of his newborn twins, weeps uncontrollably. They were killed in an airstrike while he was out running errands. A boy stares into the distance with a blank, emotionless face; his entire family is gone. How do you console a child whose world was obliterated in seconds? How do you justify children dying from heart attacks because they’re so paralyzed with fear? [The story of 5 year old Hind Rajab is just devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i9099v/the_story_of_hind_rajab/). But instead of universal outrage, we hear excuses. *""Shouldn’t have started a war you can’t win,""* they say. As if that justifies killing children. As if those children were combatants instead of victims. And to those claiming *""It started on October 7th,""* where were you when children were being humiliated, harassed, and terrorized by idf soldiers years before? This isn’t about land anymore. It’s about the inhumanity of it all. And if your reaction is to pick a side instead of mourning the dead, I don’t know what to tell you.

**Sudan**

The UAE has provided funding, logistics, and military equipment under the guise of securing its economic interests. Reports show that weapons and ammunition have been covertly supplied to the RSF, even as UAE denies involvement. Humanitarian aid shipments have been revealed as covers for arms transfers, and recent investigations by US lawmakers confirmed ongoing support from the UAE despite its official denials. Now over 10.2 million people displaced. More than 750,000 people on the brink of starvation. Entire communities wiped out as the RSF slaughters civilians with impunity, committing acts of genocide that shock even those hardened by years of conflict. Families, already living in desperate conditions, are left with no choice but to flee. Refugee camps swell with starving, sick, and traumatized survivors who may never see justice.

**Unequal Attention**

What breaks me most is how unequal the coverage is. It was easier to find the details of Palestinian atrocities than it was for Sudanese or Congolese ones. And I say this as an African. My own people, my brothers and sisters, are so overlooked that their suffering isn’t even documented properly. The media relegates African atrocities to footnotes, treating them as less significant than others. The world cries for Ukraine or Gaza, and they should, but where are those same voices for Sudan and the DRC? The silence is deafening.

**Theological Reflection**

I’m sick of hearing people try to explain this away. Whether in the DRC, Sudan or Gaza, the suffering is not part of some mysterious, divine plan. If God exists and allows this, He isn’t good. If He wants to stop it but can’t, He isn’t powerful. Claiming He’s all-loving in the face of these horrors is an insult to every victim’s memory. Spare me the debates about free will or 'God works in mysterious ways.' There is no justification for this. No excuse for letting innocent children suffer, for letting entire families and communities be destroyed. If your God loves you, fine. But don’t call Him all-loving, because His actions (and lack thereof) don't reflect that.

**Historical Atrocities in the Name of God**

This isn’t a modern problem. Religion has justified horrors for centuries. The Crusades left rivers of blood in their wake. Colonialism destroyed entire continents. In Africa, missionaries came with Bibles in hand, preaching salvation while stealing land and stripping people of their culture. In the Americas, conquistadors slaughtered Indigenous people in the name of Christ. One Native American chief, before being executed by the Spanish, said, *""I do not want to go to heaven if that’s where the Spanish are.""* Can you blame him? Heaven was a place for the colonizers; a paradise for murderers who brought nothing but death and destruction.

Are Africans Divided Because of the West?,"I recently went on a date with a Nigerian man. Some of my friends were against the idea because they were scared due to stereotypes about Nigerian men, especially after the incident in Roysambu. Despite their concerns, I decided to go ahead with the date since we were meeting in a public place.

During our conversation, we talked about African politics and the lack of radical changes in the continent. He argued that whenever a leader emerges who genuinely cares about their country’s development, they often get killed. He used Muammar Gaddafi as an example, claiming that the West doesn’t want to see Africa succeed.

We also discussed the Roysambu incident. He believes it was a setup, suggesting that it happened because President Ruto proposed visa-free travel for certain African countries. According to him, the West allegedly saw this as a threat and orchestrated events to turn Africans against each other. He claimed the person behind the Roysambu murder wasn’t even Nigerian but was framed to foster hatred against Nigerians. He also cited similar xenophobic incidents in South Africa, where Nigerians were attacked after being wrongly accused of murder, only for it to be revealed later that a Nigerian wasn’t responsible.

He shared a heartbreaking story about a West African woman whose Kenyan visa expired just a few hours before she could cross the Ugandan border. She couldn’t pay the fine, so the authorities took her off the bus, raped her, and only then allowed her to go. This was after the authorities had singled out Nigerians, asking them to show their passports and subjecting them to unnecessary scrutiny. The woman’s only fault was being Nigerian and on a bus that left late.

He also told me about his personal experience of being framed and arrested in Kenya simply because of his nationality. He talked about the challenges Nigerians face when applying for visas to Kenya, mentioning how they are often mistreated during the process.

All of this got me wondering: Are Africans truly this divided, or is this division fueled by external forces like the West? How much truth is there in what he said?

"Why Americans might go to Heaven, and Kenyans won’t","Religion is an example of weak people becoming resentful because of their inability to be strong. Religion is important to people who are oppressed and Nietzsche calls it slave morality. It is not that the oppressed people cannot be the oppressors, they just don’t have access to being oppressors. Look at Kenya, for instance, a religious country with a majority waiting on God to save them. Yes, go out and ask them, you will find them fasting and praying for a good country. The oppressed create a slave morality, which resents the rich. Religion urges you to be humble, meek, among other things, and then perceives them as good. It embraces suffering for a greater good. So, churches will never ask people to fight for their rights, but will convince them that their suffering is good and a test towards something great.

And that is why I think Americans will go to heaven (heaven meaning a good life and not the divine one) and we won’t. Because we are weak and we live a lie. The Americans and other developed countries are like that because they understand their rights and are strong enough to fight for them. How long would it take to realize that God is never coming to save you? How long till you get out of your comfort zone, and realize that the good life you want is actually within your jurisdiction? How long till you realize that you are the duty bearer of the accountability you speak of?

Kenya isn't ready for the type of politics and leadership some of us wish we had.,"Recently I've developed an overall dark view of the Kenyan public based on trends and discussions online regarding 2027.

We can't seriously pretend to want a better country if a significant number of Kenyans still follow Ruto, Rigathi, Raila and many other shady characters who are essentially the source of our problems.

Our political establishment lacks serious talent capable of bringing change too. In short, Kenya lacks a visionary and transformational leader. I'm not sure such an individual even exists, and who has the resources and courage to vie.

There's even debate about fronting the even more corrupt and hateful Matiangi to take over from Ruto in 2027. You seriously can't want to get rid of Ruto just to replace him with  Matiangi. That would officially confirm that we're a moronic society incapable of basic critical thinking.


All factors considered, I've come to the conclusion that Kenya is a desperate and hopeless society with a vastly uninformed population prone to herd mentality and identity politics. As emotional voters, Kenyans are easily swayed by cheap propaganda into falling for any shady characters with charismatic appeal who makes grandiose short term promises. Kenyans distrust alternative leadership and view all candidates as bad, and vote on basis of choosing a ""lesser evil"".

Advice for woman considering security guard jobs in Canada -- scams?,"I'm an American currently staying at a conservancy in Kenya, and one of the rangers has been asking me for advice about her plan to move to Ontario Canada to take a job as a security guard.  This immediately raised questions in my mind because I know the Canadian immigration system requires employers to prove that there is no citizen who will take the job before allowing hiring of foreigners.  I also have read articles about scammers in developing countries including Kenya scamming and cheating job applicants.  On the other hand, I did find one online article that said that there is a need for security guards in Ontario.  I asked if she has talked to people currently in Canada who have done this job and it doesn't sound like she has, which concerns me.

African Self-esteem,"I didn't know how to term this but...

Is it only me that whenever I am searching for anything intellectually incluned that relates to me as a Kenyan, be it a research topic and papers, philosophy, religion, history, a medical condition or symptoms and it's medication, social topics like marriage and relationshis, reviews on a wide array of products i.e tech products, cosmetics, medicine, travel destinations, food and nutrition, I always find myself searching first from African professionals, researchers, revieweres, travel vloggers and bloggers, journalists etc. before venturing out to see what the West thinks?

And this comes second to nature subconsciously. I asked around from friends and they honestly don't care much and it got me thinking if I am alone.

There is so much disinformation out there about so many issues affecting and surrounding the African being down to our anatomy that I think always using western blanket impositions is dangerous especially in attaining the African Pan-Africanism we all aspire to. Just imagine Kenya and Africa outside the lenses of Neocolonialism. A pipe dream maybe but surely not far fetched if we intentionally choose to be fully self reliant and sufficient by continuing to champion and funding Research cognitive to Africans, encourage literature and arts by documenting our unique lives, redefining oir history and championing it for a better future for ourselves and weaning ourselves off the culture of outside reliance.",Kenya,Either_Letterhead_39,2025-06-17 08:46:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ldi2ul/african_selfesteem/,6,4,kenya donor funding
Incubators- The Infamous Startup Support Racket,"Anyone else notice there’s a whole swarm of these *“training-first, funding-maybe”* programs targeting African startups? Especially here in Kenya?

Every other year, there’s some new incubator or accelerator dropping flashy ads promising mentorship, exposure, networking, “access to capital”... the usual dream.

But then you visit their website — and the first thing you see is a price tag.

>KES 15,000 to attend our Founders Bootcamp

Bro? Excuse me?? You want founders — the people already broke, already hustling, already building — to *pay you* to teach them how to be founders?

Make it make sense.  
They’re literally selling *the idea* of being a founder back to the people who are already doing it. 😭

It’s like walking into a hospital with a bleeding arm and they say, *“Sure, but first, pay for this course on how to be a better patient.”*

These programs are out here monetizing the grind.  
Not funding founders — they're farming us.

If your “incubator” makes its money by charging struggling entrepreneurs for workshops, training, and a shot at “maybe funding”… you’re a scam.",Kenya,bravethoughts,2025-06-09 12:12:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l7367k/incubators_the_infamous_startup_support_racket/,2,2,kenya donor funding
I don't know how to title this ...,"I don't know if I've tittle this correctly but ...., I'll just write sometimes all you have is pen and paper and in my case a laptop ,Wi-Fi and reddit will do , lol.

I'm in my mid thirties for context. 2 years ago I embarked on a journey to create employment not only for myself but possibly for the people around me in my community and globally. A girl can dream right. My thought process was we consume a lot from the western world and all other areas of the globe but what do they consume from us directly? They have platforms and avenues where they can sell arts crafts and all kinds of creations straight from their backyards or garages and make really good money and sustain their livelihoods'. I was like you know what, we have all these hand crafted stuff that they pay top dollars for why cant we create platforms or channels  where our local artisans especially east Africans can market and sell their artifacts to the world and make their money ? 

I also had an idea to build a digital product one that defies borders, wipes them out completely and turns the world into a true global village, put real connections right at our fingertips. Just Imagine the infinite doors this could open mixing cultures blending Ideas people from totally different worlds working together with the possibility of creating honest income. A girl can dream. besides mobile money transfer originated from Africa, Kenya to be precise.

One thing about it that's not two, dreams need actions to actualize, to actualize one needs resources.  Resources can be monetary but in my journey I've come to realize resource is a heavy packed word. A roof over your head , a meal , health care , moral mental ,emotional support all are vital resources when it comes to building on as well as actualizing our dreams. For the past one year I've been running on fumes. last week Monday had to give up all my possessions for auction, the last thing I have to my name is my laptop. by end of day today I will be homeless as my landlady gave me notice to vacate .

I tried setting up a go fund me ... funny story the hoops and loops one has to go through smh. 

I tried UFANDAO guess what they expect you to give first to receive and you know what you cant donate to African causes literally. when you try you find you're blocked from donating to any African causes 

And then there's PayPal that treats receiving money in Africa like a conduit to funding terror groups or money laundering. Try creating [Paypal.me](http://Paypal.me) let me know how it goes if you're in Africa.

There's a chihuahua somewhere on these fundraiser platforms that's probably garnered over 10 thousand USD in donations while I have to pay for my fundraiser to go live ... diabolical. I don't have it but I somehow have to have it to get help I need to have it ? I'm confused lol. 

My mental health is probably in the dumpster somewhere, but lets assume that for now, if I ignore it long enough it probably wont exist.  

What am I saying ? dear Africa we have the capacity resources brains skilled labor  and everything else in-between to create a self sufficient continent. we let the western world take soo much from us while they give literally nothing back but religion and a dream that our riches are in heaven while actively enjoying our tangible resources to make their lives easier and better.

Dear Gentle Readers,"Good morning my gentle readers

Today I have a question to this men, why are you so tied up with your friends that you prioritise them over your families ama it's just baba without manners? 

Anyway Reason number 4 on why I will never forgive baba without manners: his unhealthy attachment with his boys. 

This particular friends have been a thorn in my life and I just blame baba without manners (I will save his number like this😂😂). 
Anyway let me take you back to the end of my second trimester heading to the third, that's when we moved in together.  

How do you people house hunt when searching for a house that utaishi na spouse wako? Si mnaenda pamoja ama? And weigh the options right? 

Aaah, baba with funds went with his friends looking for a house that we are supposed to live in. I tell him, na si uende na mimi juu unaenda kuishi na mimi😐😐. It fell on deaf ears. Anyway, he goes with them looking through different houses and the only thing I get is videos and reasons why he doesn't wanna live in the area. 

He finds the house we are currently living in, and kwanza it is on the 5th floor and this building has no lift. By then I was very heavily pregnant and such a distance would have been a great inconvenience. Anyway, baba without manners commits all of that and just sends the video. I see it's a nice house and tells me, ameshalipia. 

By then, I had moved out of my sweet house🤣🤣the house i was very happy in and experienced so much growth. Aaah, baba without manners wewe🙄🙄🙄. So, he moves everything in and comes for my clothes. And tells me, he will come pick me up kesho yake. True to his word, he did come lakini hio heaviness kwa roho yangu jamani. And shockingly, nilipanda stairs mpaka fifth floor and I was out of my breath. 

But moving into that house became a thorn into my life, each weekend baba without manners forces me to go home because he wants to host his friends. At first I get mad, and walk out naenda home. One weekend I refused to go home, I told him, kwani nyi wanaume wote wasita hamuezi kakomboa air bnb mkae huko🙄🙄

Gentle readers, ni kama niliguza nyuki, he started ranting, he said venye, I do Everything for you, na we kunipea tu privacy kwa nyumba yangu ata huezi. Enda kwenu nitakukujia tuende kanisa on sunday🫥. Mimi nikasema siendi, Aaah, aliongea matope wadau hata skuamini. He left, akaenda shugli zake and came back the following day mchana claiming ametoka ulevi hata sikuuliza. 

I asked him one day, si hata unipeleke just kwa park nikaone wanyama basi. ( nikiwa mdogo sijai enda hizo school trips because apparently my shosho didn't see the need to pay for me to go see wild animals). He told me he will ask his friends they plan for it. Aaah, curse those men, walikataa wakasema huko wameenda mara mingi. Anyway, the only place baba with manners takes mi ni kanisa na kwao na kwetu sometimes. Smh. 

Nothing can be done juu lazima hio committee iamue mambo ya kwangu. Anyway, one of his friends has a wife that decided she wants to be happy. Now, they all call her a hoe just because hangojei bwana yake to do things with her. Baba without manners is now projecting that on me. He says venye akiwai nipata nikikunywa tutakosana vibaya sana. 😂😂😂. 

Now, that is really affecting my freedom, juu, lets say I go even to town, aaah baba without manners will keep calling me after every 20 minutes aniambie niende home. Kwanza saa hii with our baby is worse. He will tell me, rudi home uangalie mtoto as if I do not know that. 

Let's go to today's incident. Nimemwambia I will leave for an hour or two, my mum is coming to town na anahitaji my help. Eeei gentle readers, ashaanza kuniuliza for how long nakaa huko. I told him mimi sijui, si he left akaenda. Now as we speak, alishapiga simu kuniambia venye whatever i am going to do in town sio important at all. I should be very fast and go back home juu hio sio emergency. 

For  context, my mum kuna siku amehitaji blood donors and baba without manners did not he gave a flimsy excuse. I couldn't donate because I am breastfeeding and pia I gave birth through CS so singekubalishwa. My mum alikua admitted close to 3 weeks and hakuai bother kuenda hata kumuona and she asked for him. He said atamuonea nyumbani, two months later he has never even asked kama ako sawa. 
Aaah, baba without manners ananichukia mimi na familia yangu yote🤣🤣🤣. 
Kwanza now that i am dependent on him, he is enjoying every bit of my misery. Hata akinituma supper, of which money is calculated so he will inspect kama nimenunua what he says, he will keep calling me to make sure I am back kwa nyumba by 6pm. Claiming hataki giza inipate nje, but surely, ulinipata nikiishi pekee yangu😅😅😅 hio supper ata saa tatu ya usiku nlikua naendea. 

So men, what the hell do you rely on yiur mbogis for? 

Till later gentle readers, 
Have a fantastic day as you grind. ",Kenya,Electrical-Bother-62,2025-05-30 06:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/,59,74,kenya donor funding
Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!. A continuation of the 1970's and 1980's second crisis of Economic theory between the two Cambridges.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2. Methodology from https://dsbb.imf.org/e-gdds/dqaf-base/country/KEN/category/NAG00. **FYI** You can calculate GDP via 3 approaches - **Income**(sources of funds), **Expenditure**(uses of funds) & **Output**(production of goods/services). To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Alleged Abduction of Kenyan MP George Koimburi Amid Political Tensions,"On 25 May 2025, George Koimburi, Member of Parliament for Juja, was allegedly abducted outside the Full Gospel Church in Mugutha, Kiambu County, Kenya, by unidentified individuals and was found the following day, injured and unconscious, at a coffee plantation in Ruiru, approximately 10 kilometres away. He is currently receiving medical treatment at Karen Hospital in Nairobi.   
  
The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

Amazing scientific facts,"Leo wacha tuongelee astrophysics.

"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”

EXCLUSIVE: How an Impostor Brought Kenya’s Premier University to Its Knees
The Curious Case of Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo – The Man Who Staged a Real-Life Thriller at the University of Nairobi
By Investigative Desk
 
If you thought Joshua Waiganjo—the man who posed as a senior police officer—was Kenya’s greatest impostor, think again. A new king of deception has emerged, and his theatre was not a remote police post, but the highest citadel of intellectualism in Kenya: the University of Nairobi (UoN). Meet Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo—a man whose mastery of lies, manipulation, and coercion reads like a Hollywood political thriller. From masquerading as a Catholic priest, senior intelligent [couldn't pronounce it well-how he'd scare people with!] officer to an international fund raiser!
This week, Ouma was finally unmasked and arraigned in court, facing charges of abuse of office, academic fraud, and the unlawful acquisition of over KES 32 million from public coffers. His arrest by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alongside senior Council members of UoN sent shockwaves across Kenya’s academic and governance sectors.
But who is Brian Ouma?
He was once a driver—yes, a driver—assigned to Chancellor Dr Vijoo Rattansi. He swindle d peopke by posing as Rattansi's PA cum bodyguard.But from those humble beginnings, Ouma’s ambitions knew no bounds. He is alleged to have forged academic documents, including an MBA certificate from a reputable university, and used them to armtwist top university official to secure top-level positions at UoN. It is only Prof. Magoha who doubted Ouma's papers and denied him a job. Prof. Magoha saw no peace as Education Cabinet Secretary until he was shiwn the door. Ouma is rumoured to have swore that Prof Magoha would never find peace, and true to hus word, Prof Magoha's attempt to become an Emeritus Professor at UoN were thwarted by Ouma! To ascend to what he referred as the 'table', Ouma manipulated University Council processes to rewrite governance structures, and eventually self-styled himself as The Chief Operations Officer (COO)—a role he created and appointed himself to. The university statutes do not have this position.
Insiders say he was so brazen that he drafted proposals to restructure the university’s governance system to weaken the Vice-Chancellor’s role and centralise all power under the COO—himself. His argument was thst a Vice-Chancellor need not be a Professor as their preview is in classrooms. At one point, he even plotted to become the Vice-Chancellor without holding a single recognised academic qualification. He would bypass the Ministry of Education, dismiss the role of the Cabinet Secretary as “cosmetic,” and advised the Council to unilaterally install his preferred Vice Chancellor!
Worse still, he allegedly  named in a scandal where he influenced the admission of unqualified students into the competitive Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Paediatrics programmes without merit. What began as fraud escalated into what could be considered educational sabotage. If true, this borders on criminal negligence—entrusting human lives to unqualified medics.
But that was not all.
Brian turned the university into his private estate. He sidelined directors, installed cronies, intimidated staff, and reportedly ran a parallel government within the institution. He filed dozens of court cases, paralysing UoN's operations and reforms. Over 400 cases are linked to his faction, turning the judiciary into his preferred tool of resistance.
He then ventured into tenderpreneurship, allegedly looting endowment funds meant for student scholarships and research. He broke deals over UoN land and dished out contracts like political favours.Any line officer who dared question his underhand deals would regret dearly. The infamous transfers of senior officers by the Council Chairman was as a result of the bad blood occasioned by Brian.Sources claim that Council members received “tokens of appreciation” to keep him in power. Council members who wouldn't toll the line are forced to resign or their appointments revoked.Through a network of enablers, he destroyed the careers of five Vice-Chancellors—Prof. Mbithi, Prof. Mbeche, Prof. Ogot, Prof. Ogeng’o, and Prof. Kiama—as well as countless administrators and technical staff who dared question his authority. The current hullabaloo at UoN is as a result of the current Vice-Chancellor refusing to give in to Ouma's demands.
The result? A once world-class university now faces over KES 13 billion in pending bills, crumbling infrastructure, and a deeply demoralised workforce. His reign pushed UoN into conflict with government, compromised its national reputation, and reversed decades of academic progress.
Brian Ouma is no ordinary impostor. He has an insatiable appetite for power. He did not stop at impersonation; he reimagined and rewrote the very fabric of governance at Kenya’s most iconic university—unchecked and unchallenged, until now.
As he now stands before the courts, Kenyans are left asking: How could the intellectual powerhouse of East Africa fall for such a man? And how many more “Brians” are hiding in our institutions?
For now, justice may finally be catching up with the man who made deception a job description. But the damage he has inflicted on UoN—and on public trust—may take years to undo.",Kenya,MbDocx,2025-05-21 05:27:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1krq5qu/uon_conned/,4,6,kenya donor funding
"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

•	When (and where) do you expect to retire?

Also, given our income levels, extended family responsibilities, and economic challenges, do you think FIRE is realistic in the Kenyan context?

We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

Have the recent world occurrences exposed how much Islamists and Christians have been manipulated in equal measure?,"As a Kenya and Christian, I must say that I have come to understand Israel to be totally different from what I believed. Christians world wide have been effectively manipulated into believing in some kind of sacred relationship with modern day Israel. It's even crazy how we've been manipulated to into a responsibility of honouring these bloody killers and idol worshipers. I mean, these are people who literally setup a national ceremony for animal blood sacrifice. These are people who've created and funded terrorist groups that massacred fir decades, and are  currently beheading Christians in Syria. Like, we're supposed to worship 

It's safe to say this notion of sacred Israel is a result of not reading the bible properly. Because the modern day nation of Israel is NOT that of the bible. 

Looking at Islam world, the manipulation has been by Saudi, Qatar, UAE dictatorial theocracies. These scums sponsor the extremist Wahhabism ideology (the one Sheikh Makaburi had started in the coast) that preaches hatred and death to Islael, US and kafirs. They fund Wahhabism indoctrination cells outside their countries, including Middle East, Africa and Asia.  

Yet, these same Saudis, Qatar & Emiratie are working with the US and Israel, even joining them against Muslims. It's not just about Gaza. Look at Sudan, Libya, Iraq.

Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Think about the last time you wanted to see good deeds from the government and people..how did it turn out? I see the general public complaining about what the government should and shouldn't do, yet they elected them. 

The general public complaining is full of unpaid loans in their folios because they want the lender to suffer - but they can't see that, they have to 'project' their anger.

The general public steals whenever theirs a chance, from building materials to hospitals, to public funds availed to them! 

Where is Kenya headed to? Kenya was in the same league with some very 'rich' countries right now, but corruption stinks it. Have you had a look at one of Kenya's international airports? Looks like a cow shed.

Private Equity Funds in Kenya,"You may not be aware, but many of our expenditures today benefit Private Equity (PE) funds. They are crowding into Kenya to get a piece of the pie. With our lax laws and poor regulation, these funds are having a field day.

PE funds now own or back Java, Naivas, Quickmart, Goodlife Pharmacies, and several private hospitals. We’re even considering PE funds for the Nairobi–Mombasa toll road.

We all know their endgame: high shareholder returns and flipping the business for a profit. It's no wonder Java has near-monthly price hikes. 

We’re gradually losing control of essential sectors to entities whose primary concern is not service or affordability but short-term financial gain. With limited public oversight, this trend will likely continue unchecked.

Most men nowadays are mentally weak.,"There is a trending story about a popular Kenyan couple. Men are defending the man using the simplistic reasoning that men budget for their affairs which I find ridiculous. These are the same men who complain that women nowadays are after money, which is not wrong but what do you expect when it is the only flex you have? I know there are men who will agree with me that affairs are expensive and time consuming. Trying to hide an affair is a lot of hard work and mental gymnastics, or maybe I am just an amateur. I have cheated emotionally on a girl, the girl I talked about in my post on Valentines, here is the link https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1im2hwi/my\_simp\_era\_valentine\_edition/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button. I don't know if that was cheating but after a certain incident I checked out of the relationship. When I asked for a break up, she wouldn't agree. At first, I tried my best to hide it, realized it was a lot of work and did it openly to push her away. We eventually broke up but for some other reason. From that experience, I learned that cheating was hard. Is that cheating since I had already withdrawn my commitment to her?

I find using an excuse like budgeting for affairs very simplistic. As a man, why are you even budgeting for affairs? That money could be put to better use. Donate to charity, sponsor a child through high school, save, buy stocks or appreciating assets, travel. The possibilities are endless. If you have to part with money to keep an affair alive you are down bad. It's worse when you have a wife or girlfriend. Also, what's up with all the infidelity? Don't you guys have self control. One thing I learned about being a man is that it is more about how you tame your sexual desires. Self control is the hallmark, the gold standard for masculinity. Plus it is the woman who is benefitting, not you. The only thing you get in exchange is a wet crack, nothing more. The woman on the other side is getting money to fund her lifestyle, if she clever enough, invest. You mean you would rather spend on her than your wife? 

Modern men are increasingly become weaker mentally and it is sad to see. I now understand why women are making better progress nowadays. These women are ruthless and very intelligent. They don't play with their money like men are doing.

"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

* Rift Valley delivered 78% of votes to Ruto in 2022. This base isn't eroding.
* Mt. Kenya may complain but historically votes for the incumbent (see Kibaki's 2007 re-election despite discontent).

**5. Our Neighbors Are Progressing While We Obsess Over Politics**

* Tanzania attracted **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank), while Uganda's **oil project** is projected to generate **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank). Furthermore, Uganda's **oil project** is expected to generate **2 billion** annually, starting in **2025** (Uganda Ministry of Energy).

Meanwhile, Kenya attracted just **$1.2 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the same period (CBK 2023 Report).

As of now, we're already in **2027 campaign mode.**

* Gen Z isn't getting IDs (only 1.2M new registrations in 2023 vs 6M eligible)
* Middle-class Kenyans will tweet but won't vote (42% turnout in urban areas)
* The poor will vote - and they'll vote for whoever meets their immediate needs

Like it or not, #TanoTena is coming. The numbers don't lie.

Why are we playing so safe?,"I recently came across a group of guys online building hardwares like keyboards; beautifully designed ones. Transparent bodies that show the internal wiring, custom keycaps, artistic builds using different materials. It wasn’t about mass production or getting rich, it was about passion. They were just playing with the craft, exploring it.

And it made me think about software, which is my space. You look outside Kenya and you see people building amazing tools:

Perplexity AI — just using open AI models and a bit of code to rethink how we search the web.

Arc and Zen Browsers — basically Chrome and Firefox underneath, but reimagined with a fresh, thoughtful design.

Fellow devs know Supabase, Planetscale, Neon DB — not revolutionary ideas, but polished tools built on existing open-source databases that solve real developer problems in elegant ways.


Over here, we mostly get another delivery app, another finance app, another ""AI girlfriend."" Even in fashion, it’s the same formula, slap a logo or quote on a blank tee and sell it as a brand. Everyone's chasing virality and “quick money,” but very few are building with care, with vision.

And it’s not just tech or fashion. In real estate, almost every property is either a high-rise apartment or a huge mansion. Nothing in between. No townhouses, no duplexes, no creative use of small spaces. Interiors are the same grey tiles, same wardrobes, same white lighting. It’s like we copied one Pinterest board and called it a day. There’s no personality in most of what we build anymore.

But I get it. People are in survival mode. Graduates want stability first. Manufacturing is hard. Logistics are unreliable. Funding is scarce. And the saddest part is that we don’t have a strong consumer culture that appreciates thoughtful, original work. So when someone actually tries to do something different, they’re often ignored, underpaid or burnt out.

This has a ripple effect. Music starts sounding the same. Apps solve the same problems. Homes all look alike. Fashion feels soulless.
And slowly, we lose our sense of wonder and our ability to imagine and build something just because it feels meaningful.

Maybe this post won’t fix anything. But maybe it resonates with someone. Because I know I’m not the only one who wants more. More soul. More play. More risk. More weird, beautiful ideas and more of the kind that make you feel something.

Sign the Petition to Declare Femicide a Crime in Kenya,"Why this petition matters


Started by Usikimye Kenya
Media inquiries
Every two days, a woman in Kenya is murdered simply because she is a woman.
This is not just another tragedy—this is femicide, the intentional killing of women because of their gender, rooted in deep-seated violence and discrimination.  
The situation is dire. In 2024 alone, at least 170 women were killed—the highest annual toll on record. Shockingly, recent reports show an average of one woman murdered every day in the past week. Yet despite this crisis, Kenya does not legally recognize femicide as a distinct crime. Without this recognition, these killings are ignored, poorly tracked, and often go unpunished.  
Why This Matters?
🔴 No Recognition, No Justice – Femicide is treated as just another homicide, allowing perpetrators to evade accountability.  
🔴 A Deadly Pattern We Can’t Ignore – These murders keep happening because the root causes—misogyny and systemic discrimination—are overlooked.  
🔴 Naming It Saves Lives – Countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Italy have recognized femicide as a crime, leading to stronger laws, better investigations, and greater protections for women.  
Kenya has the chance to be the first African nation to take this critical step—setting a powerful example for the continent and affirming that women’s lives matter.  
Our Demands
We call on the Kenyan government to:  
✅ Legally define femicide as a distinct crime to ensure proper tracking and accountability.  
✅ Strengthen laws and policies to prevent these killings and protect women.  
✅ Guarantee thorough investigations and justice for victims.  
✅ Increase funding for survivor support services.  
We have laws protecting property and money—yet when a woman’s life is stolen for being a woman, the system fails her. This must change.  
Justice begins with recognition. Justice begins with us.  
Sign this petition today to demand Kenya declare femicide a crime.

When Kevo went to buy a Toyota Fielder in Mombasa… (Brace yourself),"Kevo is still too traumatized to speak in full sentences. 😭

So Kevo decides he’s done being carless in Nairobi. Tired of begging Ubers and being told *“siko mbali, niko tao”* by a guy in Rongai.

So Kevo jets down to Mombasa,  lands  like a king. Shirt open, chest out, stress low to buy a Toyota Fielder from his boy who owns Alasiri Motors. They went to the same high school, both got suspended for reasons we don’t discuss anymore. Straightforward mission. Car is smooth, engine purrs like a cat that pays rent. Everything is clicking.  
BUT.  
This is Kevo we’re talking about. A man who has never seen red flags. Only maroon decorations. 😩  
After the car deal, Kevo turns to Alasiri and says: ""Bro... I’ve never clapped buibui cheeks. Sasa niko Coast, si mnipee experience ya wenyeji""

INSTEAD of telling him to pray and go sleep, Alasiri claps his hands like Thanos and goes,  
“Weh. Umefika. Wacha nicheze kama mimi.”

They roll up to Bamburi. You know that place where logic goes to die and thighs roam free like devolution funds.  
They hit the club.  
Lights dim. Music loud.  
Enter: vodka + poor decisions combo pack (Kenya Cane + ego).

Then Kevo sees *HER*.  
Tall. Graceful. Wrapped in a black buibui like she was hiding state secrets and heartbreak.  
The way her fabric floated in the coastal breeze? Bro almost proposed right there with airtime.

Kevo leans to Alasiri and whispers,  
*""Bro, hiyo ni wife material ya UAE. She’s wrapped like economy is hard but heart is soft.""*

Kevo approaches her with the swagger of a man who’s never known defeat, only delays.  
Drops a few lies.  
Mentions he owns land in Kamulu and drives a hybrid.  
Buibui giggles. (Kevo took it as flirtation. It was witchcraft 🧙🏾‍♂️)

She agrees to roll back to his hotel.

Alasiri, like a good wingman, drops them at the hotel around 11:15PM.  
Then dips. Switches to husband mode. Phone on DND.  
Bro is unavailable like NHIF when you need it most.

**THEN.**

Morning comes.  
Alasiri opens his eyes to 22 MISSED CALLS from Kevo.  
From 2AM to 6:30AM.  
Even God was still buffering. But Kevo? Fighting demons.

He calls back.

Kevo picks on the first ring, breathless. Voice trembling like a Safaricom MPESA outage.“BROOOOOOOO... HII BUIBUI... SI NI KIJAMAA!!!!! 😭😭😭”

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Plot twist from Riverwood itself.  
The “mrembo” was a fully assembled man.  
Guy had more equipment than a boda boda spare parts shop.

Apparently, things got spicy. Kevo reached to ""unveil the mystery"" like Moses and the burning bush...  
Only to find a **shock absorber**.

He screamed so loud the hotel wanted to change their name to *""Whispers Inn.""*

The buibui bro, completely unbothered, sipped water and said:  
“Si I thought we were vibing?”

**VIBING WHERE??? IN GETHSEMANE???**

Kevo lost it.

Started rebuking the room like it owed him rent.  
Shouted “Rudi nyuma shetani!” DRUNK, while holding a Gideon’s Bible from the drawer.  
Tried to jump out the window in boxers with one sock.  
Security came thinking there was a robbery.  
Manager knocked.  
Buibui bro sat calmly, legs crossed, sipping his/her Keringet like “I did nothing. He picked me.” 💅

Kevo’s soul left his body three times that night.  
But Alasiri? Bro was snoring in his matrimonial bed. Dreaming of loyalty and lentils.

Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

TL;DR: 

Curious to know whether there are founders/entrepreneurs here who've managed to tap into local sources of funding to solve for local problems, given that the Kenyan ecosystem is saturated with VC money that doesn't care much for profitability but hype and growth potential.",Kenya,bravoyankee37,2025-04-07 19:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtthj6/kenyan_startup_environment_and_what_can_be_done/,5,3,kenya donor funding
MEXT,"

Last year I made a post informing people about the existence of this scholarship. 
I just wanted to remind you guys early enough this year. 

And I also decided to repost a comment I had made last year regarding the process. 

The process.(For people planning to apply for postgraduate studies; masters and PhD)

1st step is document screening.

They'll need a bunch of documents from you. An application form, which can be downloaded from their website, medical form, research proposal, certified documents( So you'll need to go to your school to have your degree and transcripts certified), and a recommendation letter( I think they insisted on this letter being from the Dean of studies, but I got mine from my department head). Also, a passport photo of you.

Last year, the documents were required in 3s. So if it's the application form, you fill it out, print it out, then make 2 more copies. Same with other documents. Don't staple the documents together. Use paper clips to attach them together.

All the documents will need to be dispatched at the Japanese embassy. It's located in upperhill, very close to CIC insurance building.

But it's important to check the website because they might need more or less documents for this year.

I should mention that there's a section on the application form that requires the applicant to list down 3 universities of choice. This section is usually super confusing if you don't know any Japanese universities but just look up 3 universities that have your course and write them down. This section can be changed later. But you do need to remember the universities you picked because they like to ask applicants during the interview stage to just mention the 3 universities they picked became they know we usually randomly pick.

2nd step English and Japanese Exam

If you pass the first stage, they'll call you for an English and Japanese written exam at the Japanese embassy. For Japanese, just guess, it's multiple choice, so just pick anything and hand in the paper. The Japanese exam exists to check your proficiency in the language. So, if you aren't proficient, then just show them that you aren't.

But for English, you need to get everything or nearly everything. The website usually has some past papers attached for anyone who needs to practise a bit before the exams. Go through the papers and familiarise yourself with the content. The English exam is not usually hard, but it's tricky. It's one of those papers where A and B can seem like probable answers, and you need to pick one. Time also runs very fast, and last year, they didn't add any time, so some people didn't make it because they did not finish in time. Also, if you dig around online, you'll find more papers. It's very important to do more papers. I did 10 papers.  It helped a lot.

3rd Step Interview

If you pass the second step, they'll call you for an interview. The interview is usually scheduled a few days after the exams. I did the exam on Friday and got a call on Monday afternoon about an interview that was scheduled for Tuesday. The questions will be general at first, questions like 'Why Japan as the country of choice?' 'How sure are you that you'll complete the course?' Etc. To questions that focus solely on your research proposal. Don't ignore small things like knowing the full title of your project, the objectives, the methodology, etc. They might also ask you to explain in brief more about the proposal.

Also, I should mention that because this scholarship is annual, they are a lot of people who have already gone through the process which means there are a lot of YouTube videos that can help you prepare for this part. They usually ask the same questions every year. There's also a MEXT sub that helped me a lot when I was applying.

4th Step: Application to universities in Japan

If you pass the 3rd step, they will call you again to present to you a 'certificate of first screening'. Which means you've completed the first stage. This stage usually involves contacting universities, more specifically, professors, asking them if they can take you as a student. The facilitators of the scholarship will email you a long list of universities plus their email contact, and it's your job to look up the universities and find a couple that you'd like to contact. When looking up universities, it's important to make sure the language of instruction for teaching is English because there's a very huge possibility that some programs are offered in Japanese only..

Remember how I mentioned that the universities you picked when you were filling out the application form could be changed. This is where you will change them.

You'll be given about a month to do this step.and in the end, you need to get at least 2 professors who will agree to take you up. The professors usually send you a letter of acceptance that you'll give the embassy much later. Around October, I think. They'll also ask you to rank the schools in order of priority even though they'll probably be the ones to make the final selection at the end. The rule of thumb is that public universities will be prioritized over private ones because they are cheaper to fund. 

I should mention that it's nearly impossible to miss out on the scholarship after passing the interview stage. Because it hasn't happened in 18 years that a student has missed the chance after passing the interview. But you still need to be diligent with the entire process.

5th Step Waiting Stage.

The deadline for submission of the letters of acceptances will probably be in October. And after you dispatch the letters at the Embassy, you'll just have to wait until they contact you again.

I really didn't like this stage because they went quiet till Feb this year. You might get hints from the school that picked you through emails explaining things like arrival dates and entrance exams to be taken, if any, but the embassy  will not communicate until Feb.

My hints started coming around December. But it was hard to know which school the Embassy had picked, so I still had to wait until the final communication was made. This year, they communicated around Feb 15th 2024. But I should mention, after that date things will start moving very very fast.

One last important thing is that even though the scholarship is funded, they will need you to source around 2000 dollars for the first month. This is usually required because they need you to open a Japanese bank account that they will be depositing your stipend in, and you can't open the bank account from Kenya. The stipend is around 144,000 yen. Because the currency rates have been fluctuating alot one of the facilitators told me that anything above 1000 dollars would still be good enough.

Last thing, If you get past the interview stage, start learning Japanese immediately. You can use duolingo to learn small introductions and also the Japanese alphabet. I've just started the classes, and they are rather intense 😅.

I’ll also include the link to the embassy here https://www.ke.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/Postgraduate.html. 

The link should have the application documents needed and also similar outline to the lengthy process I described above. 

If you need any guidance you can reach out, but please read the very lengthy process I’ve outlined below before reaching out. And also visit the website. 

Things might have changed so it’s critical to visit the website. ",Kenya,Difficult-Koala-6876,2025-04-05 01:55:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jrso38/mext/,315,82,kenya donor funding

The Affordable Handshake: Will Ruto’s Dalliance with Baba Fade Before the Ink Dries?,"There is an african proveeb that says ""He who swallows a whole coconut must trust his anus."" 

Ruto has just swallowed the biggest political coconut of his life i.e shaking hands with Raila Odinga. And now, he must trust that his political stomach can digest it without embarrassing consequences. This is not just a handshake; it’s a full-course meal of survival politics, and Ruto knows that without Raila, his presidency risks serious indigestion.

Today’s handshake at State House wasn’t just a photo-op, it was Ruto and Raila signing their political death wish. And when the time comes, Gen Z, the undertaker, will conduct their final rites in August 2027.

Ruto, the self-proclaimed anti-dynasty warrior, has now tied his fate to Baba’s heartbeat. If, God forbid, Raila took an unscheduled trip to the ancestors tonight, Ruto would blow the entire 2025/26 national budget on witchdoctors, Silicon Valley AI, and importing foreign rogue pastors to try and resurrect him. And best believe, he’d out-mourn the Odinga familybwith his tears flooding the streets of Bondo while wearing the defeated look that Kimani Ichungwa had on Al Jazeera's Mehdi.

Forget the Finance Bill riots or Gen Z’s X Space rants—this would be the real crisis. Ruto, on his knees, wailing, “Hustlers, we need Baba back, or I’m finished!” Kenyan politics thrives on these dramatic alliances, and Ruto knows his Mount Kenya votes are already doing the Harlem Shake after Gachagua’s impeachment. Without Raila, he’s just a hustler with no dynasty to lean on.

Of course, Baba has been given billions, it’s become tradition at this point. But at 82, will he exhaust the billions before the sun sets on him? Will he have enough time to enjoy the spoils, or will nature cash its check before he does?

Another wise African Proverb says that a monkey that dances by the roadside must be prepared for stones.

For years, Ruto paraded himself as the anti-handshake champion, swearing he’d never share power with Raila. But today, the same Ruto is dancing by the roadside—and the stones are coming. The same Kenyans that roasted Uhuru for shaking Raila’s hand in 2018 is now polishing their slingshots, ready to fire at this new bromance. If Ruto thought Uhuru’s handshake was unpopular, wait till he sees what 2027 has in store.

Ruto has now invited Baba for tea faster than you can say ‘blood-based government.’ With ODM figures in Cabinet and Raila’s AUC bid flopped, Ruto’s presidency is basically a high-stakes chama where Baba is the treasurer holding all the cash 😂. If Raila checks out, Ruto’s left clutching a useless chequebook, out-crying the Odingas at the funeral, and begging the IMF for a loan to hire a time machine.

Meanwhile, Azimio diehards would scream deep state conspiracy, claiming Raila was taken out just to keep Kalonzo waiting forever.

Context is everything: Ruto’s been juggling a rebellious Mount Kenya, a sulky Uhuru, and a Gen Z movement ready to storm State House armed with Wi-Fi and vibes. Raila is his political oxygen mask—lose him, and he’s gasping in the thin air of 2027 re-election dreams. You’d see a state-sponsored sob-fest so dramatic, it’d make Mexican telenovelas jealous. The man might even pawn the Harambee House furniture to fund a “Resurrect Raila Taskforce” featuring NASA (the space agency, not the coalition) and a hotline to Wakanda.

This is peak Kenyan politics: one minute, you’re enemies; the next, you’re bromancing so hard that if one dips, the other is ready to bankrupt the nation and outweep the family, just to keep the show going.

Wait, was it a discounted dynasty alliance? Either way, Ruto just bought what he swore he’d never touch—at a price Kenya might soon start feeling.

Ruto’s not just shaking hands—he’s clutching on Raila like a lifeline. But will the lifeline hold until 2027, or will Gen Z deliver the final rites?

Ruto and Jayesh Saini have ruined our public health system,"Around december the [daily nation](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/mystery-supplier-to-get-sha-billions-4843936#story) reported that GoK had secretly entered into a hospital equipment leasing scheme dubbed the National Equipment Support Program[NESP]. Governors were [coereced](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/12/ruto-terms-kahigas-coercion-claims-in-county-medical-lease-scheme-untrue/) into signing those agreements with wahindi brokers (the jayesh saini cartel). Instead of going directly to original equipment manufacturers like GE and ROCHE - ruto's regime went to the brokers (recently a CT scan burst into [flames](https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/ct-scan-machine-at-kericho-hospital-destroyed-in-fire-n358467) at kericho). Under  [Uhuru](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/ge-to-admit-first-batch-of-health-workers-at-sh1-3bn-training-hub--2118720) - we also had an equipment leasing program [MES] but most of it was with OEMs. They would directly provide support services.

Now here comes the juicy part - under the NESP agreement. For each claim under SHA in public hospitals, the hospitals are required to pay [60%](https://x.com/Dialmaterialist/status/1895086475378565308?t=BRr6Fp_JYr9BkrVqGQFmgQ&s=19) of that figure to  the vendors (equipment brokers). SHA makes direct payment to the vendors. Public hospitals will never touch the 60%.

We now move to the second part of the [SHA heist](https://x.com/Martowachira/status/1896617548403322902?t=DfZOTcpT5yv7nZt5d1u5QQ&s=19). The consortium of Apeiro, Safaricom and Konvergenz network solutions, which has 104 billion agreement gets 5% of all hospital claims and  1.5% for a track and trace solution. On top, they also get 2.5% of all member contributions made to SHA.


Therefore, ruto and the wahindi brokers get 60% +5% +1.5% + 2.5% of all member contributions = 66.5% + 2.5% of the total SHA collection per month/year

That leaves public hospitals with approximately ~30% to run their operations. Assuming they were to be self-sustaining, the 30% would have to cater for staff of all cadres, acquire drugs from KEMSA, electricity bills, water, waste disposal, repairs etc

You can also factor in the [frequent delays](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/counties-hit-as-treasury-delays-cash-disbursements-4763402) in transferring devolved funds  to county governments -

Consequentially, public hospitals can't function effectively under this system.

Faith- based hospitals are somehow able to survive because they don't have to pay 60% to the wahindi brokers for leased medical equipment

Kenya’s Economic Reality: Why Fighting Corruption Alone Won’t Fix Our Problems,"I was having a discussion with my friends about the state of sports in Kenya, and one of them was passionately arguing that the government does very little to support sports. While that’s true, a deeper look at successful sports industries worldwide shows that sports are largely private enterprises. Private investors own the teams, sponsor the leagues, and build the stadiums. The same applies to most thriving industries—large businesses that employ thousands are privately owned, not run by the state. Governments, after all, tend to be inefficient economic managers.

This got me thinking about Kenya’s economy and the role of government in development.

Our Revenue vs. Spending Needs

Last year, KRA collected KES 2.4 trillion in taxes, which sounds like a lot, but in reality, it’s far from enough. If we were to fund the country’s essential sectors at functional—not even first-world—levels, we would need:

Education – KES 850 billion

Healthcare – KES 700 billion

Police & Interior – KES 425 billion

Judiciary – KES 80 billion

County Allocations – KES 650 billion

Defense – KES 700 billion

Infrastructure Development – KES 1.2 trillion

Annual Debt Repayments – KES 1.85 trillion


That’s a total of KES 6 trillion per year, yet we only collect about KES 2.5 trillion, leaving a KES 3.5 trillion gap.

Corruption Isn’t the Only Problem

Many politicians and activists keep repeating the same talking point: ""We need to fight corruption."" Sure, corruption is a problem, but let’s be realistic—it won’t magically bridge this revenue gap. Even if we eliminated corruption completely and spent every shilling efficiently, we’d still be working with half the money we actually need—just enough to survive, not thrive.

This is where Kenya’s leadership has consistently failed. Where are the comprehensive economic policies? Where are the white papers outlining how we move from an economy based on agriculture and low-value industries to a high-value, industrialized economy?

The Missing Conversation: Private Investment & Economic Growth

Morara Kebaso, Martha Karua, and other critics of the current regime talk endlessly about corruption, but where is their economic plan? What strategies do they have for:

- Attracting private investors?

- Encouraging industrialization and manufacturing?

- Reducing reliance on primary production and low-value industries?


It is not the government’s job to build businesses or factories. The government’s role should be to create an environment where private investors can thrive—this means:

1. Security – Investors won’t risk their money in unstable environments.


2. A strong legal system – Property rights must be guaranteed.


3. Infrastructure – Roads, electricity, and digital connectivity must be in place.



Yet, these topics are rarely discussed in Kenyan political discourse.

Fighting Corruption is Expensive

If we’re serious about fighting corruption, we need to acknowledge something crucial—it’s hella expensive.

To effectively combat corruption, Kenya needs:

A well-funded judiciary – Corruption trials take time, resources, and skilled legal teams.

A strong police force – Anti-corruption agencies need proper funding and independence.

A capable defense system – A strong military isn’t just about external threats; it ensures national stability and can deter external actors who enable corruption (e.g., countries where corrupt officials stash their money).


Without this, anti-corruption rhetoric remains just that—rhetoric.

Kenya’s Stagnation: The Economics of Poverty

At the end of the day, we are stuck in a cycle where we don’t generate enough wealth to fund our institutions, yet we expect those same underfunded institutions to drive change. It won’t happen. We need to:

1. Shift our economic focus from primary production to value addition and industrialization.


2. Encourage private sector growth instead of looking to the government for everything.


3. Prioritize economic policies over empty political slogans.



Until then, we will remain trapped in the economics of poverty, talking about corruption while ignoring the bigger picture.

Honest question: Why nations fail?,"For context, I'm a student at a public university in the capital. So at various points this week, I've had discussions with my classmates on the trajectory of attaining wealth in the Kenyan sphere.

With a dose of reality, we came to the conclusion that its in Politics, industry (owning means of production) or a successful professional career.

But more emphasis is the route of politics. Is it a coincidence that our last 2 presidents are the top 10 richest people in the country? What business can Ruto or other politicians like Murkommen & Gachagua claim to have given them billions of shillings via entrepreneurship?

So the way I see it, most young people are potential thieves without opportunity. What stuck out to me the most was my classmates who are vying for student leadership positions are the ones most vocal in using political office to get 'fuck you money'.

And honestly, it's hard to blame them. There's a clear lack of entrepreneur role models in this country to whom the youth can look up to to inspire them to be titans of industry in the future. Not by stealing public funds, but by solving problems in the market.

22 year olds in the US, Estonia , China etc are looking to BUILD startups to be the next Sam Altman, Jack ma, and Elons. Here, 22 year olds are looking to form new political parties so as to gain power and rob the public they're meant to serve.

This is WHY NATIONS FAIL. When greed is allowed to fester, the country becomes an open wound. 

100 years from now, if we allow Kenya to weaken as our neighbors grow in strength, will we even be able to defend our borders? Will our children and grandchildren look forward to stay, work , love and grow their families here? Will we even be able to feed ourselves? That is the long term we need to see. Unless your plan is to emigrate, then enrich yourself by all means.

Most NGO's are funded through donor support. Your bosses may not tell you, but in the next 2-3 months, most of you will have to be let go (fired). You need to start making deliberate decisions to prepare for that eventuality. I know you are used to good salaries (200k - 500k) and you probably live in an apartment of 60k-120k. First things first..

1) Look for a cheaper rental house (20k max) that you can afford to pay without struggling.

2) Avoid taking any loans (cars, mortgage) cos this will exacerbate your situation incase you are fired

3) Start thinking of a business you can setup (be smart about it, businesses that target basic needs like food, clothing, shelter tend to do good)

4) Start praying that Trump will change his mind and that the donor support will not be halted.",Kenya,wangai254,2025-02-06 09:48:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iiyykv/advice_for_every_kenyan_who_works_for_an_ngo_non/,1,4,kenya donor funding

"If God is all-powerful, He cannot be all-good. And if He's all-good then He cannot be all-powerful","I heard this quote in 2016's Batman vs Superman. I was about 14 years old, a Christian like my parents. I dismissed it as blasphemous and didn't think about it much after that. But over the years, personal and geopolitical events have pushed me to examine spirituality through theological, logical, and historical lenses. I turn 22 this year and now I’m an atheist. This quote resonates with me in a way I never imagined it could.

**The DRC**

In Goma, a church was bombed less than a week ago. Yet, it barely made a blip in international media. The tragedy was just another drop in the ocean of atrocities. A Congolese national on TikTok shared a video of his team delivering aid when a bomb landed just meters away. You can hear the gunshots in the background as they scrambled for safety. In the same video, a woman and her young child calmly narrate the bombing like it’s just another day. Children are trafficked and enslaved to mine the cobalt and coltan that power our smartphones and electric cars. They die in suffocating pits, crushed under collapsing earth. The ones who survive often endure daily abuse, starvation, and diseases no child should ever face. I could give you the statistics but we have been desensitized so that occurrence was the grunge reality of those on the ground. Ponder on it. Then go amplify [Pappy Orion TikTok's page](https://www.tiktok.com/@pappyorion) as he shares with the world the grim reality of those on the ground.

**Palestine**

The following are videos I've seen with my own eyes: A child sits in the rubble of their destroyed home, shaking uncontrollably, panicking, frantically looking for a place to hide as planes pass overhead. A man holds up a half-mutilated body of a child, missing parts from the torso down and flesh hanging off the place of severance. A father, holding the birth certificates of his newborn twins, weeps uncontrollably. They were killed in an airstrike while he was out running errands. A boy stares into the distance with a blank, emotionless face; his entire family is gone. How do you console a child whose world was obliterated in seconds? How do you justify children dying from heart attacks because they’re so paralyzed with fear? [The story of 5 year old Hind Rajab is just devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i9099v/the_story_of_hind_rajab/). But instead of universal outrage, we hear excuses. *""Shouldn’t have started a war you can’t win,""* they say. As if that justifies killing children. As if those children were combatants instead of victims. And to those claiming *""It started on October 7th,""* where were you when children were being humiliated, harassed, and terrorized by idf soldiers years before? This isn’t about land anymore. It’s about the inhumanity of it all. And if your reaction is to pick a side instead of mourning the dead, I don’t know what to tell you.

**Sudan**

The UAE has provided funding, logistics, and military equipment under the guise of securing its economic interests. Reports show that weapons and ammunition have been covertly supplied to the RSF, even as UAE denies involvement. Humanitarian aid shipments have been revealed as covers for arms transfers, and recent investigations by US lawmakers confirmed ongoing support from the UAE despite its official denials. Now over 10.2 million people displaced. More than 750,000 people on the brink of starvation. Entire communities wiped out as the RSF slaughters civilians with impunity, committing acts of genocide that shock even those hardened by years of conflict. Families, already living in desperate conditions, are left with no choice but to flee. Refugee camps swell with starving, sick, and traumatized survivors who may never see justice.

**Unequal Attention**

What breaks me most is how unequal the coverage is. It was easier to find the details of Palestinian atrocities than it was for Sudanese or Congolese ones. And I say this as an African. My own people, my brothers and sisters, are so overlooked that their suffering isn’t even documented properly. The media relegates African atrocities to footnotes, treating them as less significant than others. The world cries for Ukraine or Gaza, and they should, but where are those same voices for Sudan and the DRC? The silence is deafening.

**Theological Reflection**

I’m sick of hearing people try to explain this away. Whether in the DRC, Sudan or Gaza, the suffering is not part of some mysterious, divine plan. If God exists and allows this, He isn’t good. If He wants to stop it but can’t, He isn’t powerful. Claiming He’s all-loving in the face of these horrors is an insult to every victim’s memory. Spare me the debates about free will or 'God works in mysterious ways.' There is no justification for this. No excuse for letting innocent children suffer, for letting entire families and communities be destroyed. If your God loves you, fine. But don’t call Him all-loving, because His actions (and lack thereof) don't reflect that.

**Historical Atrocities in the Name of God**

This isn’t a modern problem. Religion has justified horrors for centuries. The Crusades left rivers of blood in their wake. Colonialism destroyed entire continents. In Africa, missionaries came with Bibles in hand, preaching salvation while stealing land and stripping people of their culture. In the Americas, conquistadors slaughtered Indigenous people in the name of Christ. One Native American chief, before being executed by the Spanish, said, *""I do not want to go to heaven if that’s where the Spanish are.""* Can you blame him? Heaven was a place for the colonizers; a paradise for murderers who brought nothing but death and destruction.

Will Mogadishu Collapse in 2025?,"I genuinely don’t understand how Somalia is still functioning as a state right now. It might come down to sheer Somali resilience because from an outside perspective, it's hard to imagine the country holding together much longer. The Somali National Army appears seems sluggish and fearful, and from what I’ve seen, they're losing territory at an alarming rate.

Back during the Obama and Biden administrations, there seemed to be a clear American rationale for pushing back al-Shabaab. There was a belief that the group could potentially train terrorists who might later threaten American or Israeli interests, or destabilise the Horn of Africa more broadly. The horn is geopolitically crucial because of its proximity to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden which are major arteries of global trade.

But since Trump took office, al-Shabaab has gone on the offensive.They seem to be hoping to seize Mogadishu itself. I don’t see the U.S. maintaining the same level of commitment to Somalia’s defence as it did a decade ago, especiallt now that they cut USAID. Turkey seems to be stepping in, and while Turkey's isn't a military to sneeze at, it's not America.

I see parallels in Sudan, but the key difference is that the Sudanese military despite its flaws is better trained and armed than Somalia’s. From what I understand, Somali troops often retreat when faced with Islamist militants, or they simply refuse to engage unless they have backing from a local clan militia. The population is also deeply afraid of al-Shabaab, which makes sense. But fear doesn’t build a successful resistance movement.

Under these conditions, I can’t see a path to military victory for Somalia’s army. If al-Shabaab does manage to seize Mogadishu, I dread to see a future where the country collapses completely. Somaliland would probably be well positioned for global recognition if this happened. They might even engage in a brief conflict with the south over disputed territories. Somaliland has a significantly more organised military than Somalia. I could see Somaliland holding its own longer than Somalia.

Nigeria's Oil Trouble and Trump's Tariffs,"Nigeria's 2025 budget is based on an oil price benchmark of $75 per barrel and a production target of 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd). However, oil prices have dropped to around $70 per barrel, with projections suggesting further declines to $60–$65 per barrel by late 2026.



Oil production has also fallen below the budgeted target, averaging only 1.5–1.7 million bpd in early 2025, further exacerbating revenue deficits.



The decline in oil prices and production could lead to a revenue gap of up to 6.6%. This could force the government to cut spending on critical sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, and education or resort to increased borrowing and taxation.



Nigeria’s fiscal deficit for 2025 is projected at Naira 18.9 trillion. The government has relied on Forward Sale Agreements (FSA) and other mechanisms to bridge funding gaps.



Nigerian oil industry is hampered by challenges such as poor infrastructure, transportation issues, security concerns and oil theft.

USAID a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?,"Just watched this and I have so many thoughts:

* *""This will be a wake-up call for African leaders""* I disagree they are very insulated from this crisis & to begin with a lot of African leaders are very happy with the AID complex ... it works for them, the americans and whomever need someone to collude with locally, they would have done something sooner if this didn't work for them. 
* *""USAID was more about a covert operation""* This sounds like a conspiracy to me, USAID is a way to perpetuate american soft power and influence, they would threaten to cut off a government doesn't fall in line but also provide aid to friendly governments even when those very governments are undemocratic. The actual aid workers, asproblematic as they are (think white saviours to the elite class of continental Africans who find work in these organizations), were not likely to be doing any covert operation.
* ""Trump is looking after his people"" ok let's see how this money is returned to the American people?!
* The GMO / HIV AIDs thing: now I know where she is coming from but this is a massive over simplification and again like a conspiracy theory

The truth is the US & many other global actors who don't have the interest of African's in mind and have very deliberately fostered a reliance on foreign aid in many nations. This has been an intentional polical project. **I agree with her** about USAID being linked to resource extraction and never actually being enough to create change. This isn't how the world should work, I agree. But **cutting off aid on a whim could cost lives.** 

Moreover making the jump from a reliance on aid to the wealth being extracted from Africa actually going back into Africa is sooo complicated even though it has to happen it won't happen over night.

Title: I grew up idolizing France. Now I see the whole system for what it is.,"I want to believe we still have what it takes—even if I’m using technology right now to make my case.

I grew up in a former French African colony. Like many of us, I thought French civilization was the peak of human achievement. Why wouldn’t I? I was raised on French literature, those old black-and-white films with De Funès, Jean Gabin, Delon, Ventura. I even spoke the language with a generic Parisian accent—despite not being French or even living there.

Then came French schools, French book clubs, the French high school diploma, and finally the privilege of studying in France.

I wasn’t the best student, but I always had this urge to deeply understand things before accepting them. That’s when I began to regret brushing off philosophy. Turns out, it’s not just abstract fluff—it’s a rigorous method to structure thought. Even mathematics, I realized, is just philosophy dressed in symbols.

But once my studies were done, I was hit with something I didn’t expect: a deep, almost institutionalized self-loathing in the country I once revered.

Not the kind of introspection that makes people kinder or more open-minded. No, this was something more vicious. A culture that punishes effort and rewards inertia—all in the name of buzzwords like “inclusion,” “diversity,” “foreign aid,” and “subsidies.” Empty mantras the average person doesn’t really buy into but is too tired or scared to question.

How did a country that once symbolized reason, order, and rural richness become a machine that spits out nonsense—and punishes those who try to love it?

Eventually, I understood: the people had been sedated. Numbed into apathy while global elites used their taxes to fund influence-peddling in *our* countries and got rich off it. It only works if the French people are passive enough not to realize they’re footing the bill—and the ""returns"" won’t benefit them or us.

Sound familiar? Promises of rosy futures, calls for sacrifice, a little more patience… We’re all on the losing side of this global con. France just uses slogans and bureaucracy; we get tampered elections and outright censorship.

We’re told to “improve governance,” “be more transparent,” and then maybe, *maybe*, we’ll earn some IMF blessing. But it’s just chess, and we’re playing with a single black pawn while others hold the board.

But there *is* another path. Not sexy, not shiny. But real.

It starts with fiscal discipline. Real investment in education—paying teachers decently, teaching three languages, philosophy, and math. That’s it. Strip it all down. Fund it through reallocating existing budgets, not new loans or flashy “projects.” Make debt interest payments transparent and boring. No mega-projects. No empty hospitals. No grand highways mortgaging the future.

Just calm, disciplined, transparent stewardship of what little we *do* control.

It won’t impress anyone on LinkedIn. But it would build generations that *think*, who don’t blindly copy but question, root themselves, and act with independent minds.

Why are we so obsessed with the flashy? They were never meant for us. And the more we chase them, the more others will treat us like well-dressed beggars.

So yeah, a zebu-drawn chariot is no Tesla Cybertruck. But at least it’s made with *our* wood, *our* iron, and *our* hands.

We just need the courage to start from there—and believe it’s worth doing.

Me? I came home. Never bothered getting a French passport. Didn’t see the point. Too much bureaucracy, and honestly, I don’t recognize what that country’s become.

The New Land Grab? Diaspora Investments and rural Gentrification in Kenya,"

Just read a sharp piece by Africa Is a Country critiquing how Pan-Africanism is being co-opted by elites and rebranded as a feel-good lifestyle instead of a liberation movement. One example that stood out: singer Kelis and her farming venture in Kenya

The article points out that diaspora celebrities like Kelis often arrive under the banner of Pan-African unity talking about ""returning to the roots"" but in practice, their ventures can reinforce the same extractive systems Pan-Africanism was meant to resist. Kelis promotes her farm as an Afro-futurist, back-to-the-land project. But when a wealthy foreigner acquires farmland in a country where locals are struggling with land access, food insecurity, and climate crisis it raises red flags.

Let’s not forget: Kenya’s most fertile lands have long been controlled by colonial settlers and a post-independence elite. Many Indigenous and rural communities are still fighting for restitution or basic access to land. In that context, when someone with celebrity capital and diaspora privilege launches a private farm, it can lead to rural gentrification higher land values, displacement, and cultural erasure just without the condos and cafés.

This isn’t about demonizing diaspora folks who want to reconnect. It’s about asking hard but necessary questions:

* Who benefits from these projects?
* Are they accountable to local communities?
* Do they challenge or replicate historic injustices?

African countries need to be neutral in far away conflicts. Learn from SEA nations who mind their business,"Really should be common sense that meddling in far away countrys' businesses will ultimately back fire on you. Kenya for example keeps finding itself geopolitically involved in far away nations business on the daily.

Last year it was Haiti, a few months ago we heard rumors about Sudan involvement, now we hear they are entering Balkan politics by recognizing Kosovo. All these actions really make no sense because Kenya is an impoverished country with a gdp per capita of barely $2k/yr.

Please African leaders learn from South East Asian countries like Malaysia who mind their own fucking business and develop their own economies peacefully. Endlessly being involving yourself in foreign affairs on behalf of the west will have massive consequences and create many enemies. You need to find as many friends as possible in this increasingly multipolar world where the west isn't all powerful like it was in the 90s.

Ex-Belgian Senator Explains Belgian Involvement in Congo Crisis and Breakdown in Relations with Rwanda.,"""I regret the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Rwanda and Belgium, while fully understanding the Rwandan position.

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot called this decision ""disproportionate"". Yet, for several weeks, convinced that he is at the center of the diplomatic game, he has been leading an aggressive campaign on behalf of the Belgian government to influence the position of the European Union and international organizations in a direction that is openly hostile to Rwanda. Never before had Belgium adopted such an offensive stance on any issue since 1994.

As I explained in La Libre (24/02/25), Belgium should have stayed out of regional conflicts and maintained strict neutrality.

Alas, as I feared, the Belgian government has reopened historical wounds in Rwanda that had partially healed since Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt's official apology in 2000. Should we remind them:

\- That the Belgians not only introduced ethnic classification on identity cards but actually created these racialized categories, instrumentalizing artificial divisions and establishing a system of systematic discrimination that poisoned relations between Rwandans for decades;

\- That Belgium’s abrupt policy shift in 1959 triggered the first ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Tutsis, causing thousands of deaths and forcing tens of thousands into exile in neighboring countries—a still vivid memory, as many adult Rwandans today personally experienced this exile and the harsh reality of refugee camps;

\- That in 1994, Belgium had early warning signs of the Tutsi genocide and did nothing to prevent it, nor even to alert the international community to its imminence;

\- That the Belgian government of the time campaigned fiercely for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR, thereby removing the last barrier against the génocidaires;

\- That certain Belgian political parties maintained ties with the genocidal government, even after the genocide, and continued to promote a biased and revisionist interpretation of events.

**That the current government ignores or pretends to ignore these facts is not only incomprehensible but profoundly irresponsible.**

Furthermore, the Belgian Parliament unanimously passed on 23 February a resolution of unprecedented hostility toward Rwanda, calling for the suspension of all economic agreements and aid, and asserting that Rwanda represents a ""threat to regional stability."" This text reflects a glaring lack of understanding of the situation on the ground — in Kivu, where I was just three days ago — and throughout the region. It also contains factually incorrect and unnecessarily hostile claims.  
**Does the Belgian government and Parliament believe they can insult, threaten, and pressure without provoking a response?**

I sincerely hope that this diplomatic crisis will not damage the deep bonds of friendship that unite many Belgians and Rwandans, including those who are also Belgian citizens.

Alain DESTEXHE  
Honorary Belgian Senator  
Initiator and Secretary of the Belgian Senate Inquiry Commission on Rwanda (1997)""

*TL;DR: This post, found on Twitter (now X) provides context to the breakdown in diplomatic relations between the two countries (Rwanda and Belgium). Alain Destexhe expresses regret over Rwanda’s diplomatic break with Belgium while acknowledging Rwanda’s reasoning. He criticises Belgium's aggressive anti-Rwanda campaign, arguing that Belgium has never taken such a hostile stance since the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsis. Destexhe says that Belgium should have remained neutral, warning that its actions have reopened historical/colonial wounds, support for anti-Tutsi violence in 1959, failure to prevent the 1994 genocide, and post-genocide ties with revisionist factions (including those who claim that Congolese and Rwandan Tutsis are foreigners in Congo and Rwanda respectively). Additionally, he condemns Belgium’s recent parliamentary resolution labelling Rwanda a ""regional threat"", calling it reckless. He questions whether Belgium expects to insult and pressure Rwanda without a response, matching Rwanda's accusations of neo-colonialism.*",Africa,HadeswithRabies,2025-03-19 09:25:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1jet0cm/exbelgian_senator_explains_belgian_involvement_in/,0,5,kenya foreign aid

* *""USAID was more about a covert operation""* This sounds like a conspiracy to me, USAID is a way to perpetuate american soft power and influence, they would threaten to cut off a government doesn't fall in line but also provide aid to friendly governments even when those very governments are undemocratic.

Africa Needs Its Own Research & Innovation. Not Just Borrowed Systems,"In many African countries, we use almost everything from Europe, America, and Asia. laws, education systems, technologies, and even business models. But what do we have to show for ourselves? What if, instead of copying, we conducted our own research to understand what humanity truly needs—then implemented solutions tailored to our realities?  

Imagine an Africa where:  
- We develop our own technologies based on our unique challenges and resources.  
- We create laws and policies that reflect our cultures, economies, and people’s needs.  
- We invest in scientific research that leads to homegrown industries instead of importing everything.  
- We unite as a continent to build self-sustaining economies, rather than relying on external aid and foreign corporations.  

For this to happen, we need:  
1. Massive investment in R&D:, Governments, universities, and private sectors must prioritize research.  
2. A shift in mindset:,   Africans must believe in our own capabilities instead of always looking outward.  
3. Support for local innovation: Instead of waiting for Silicon Valley, why not build the next tech revolution right here?  

Africa has the talent, the resources, and the potential. The real question is:

"From Tanzania to Zimbabwe: How Africa's Ruling Elite Stay in Power, Summarised","From Tanzania to Zimbabwe, Africa's ruling elites have mastered the art of staying in power. Our investigation reveals how they control foreign aid, export revenues, and patronage networks to maintain their grip while development stagnates.

# The ""Gatekeeper"" Mechanism

African leaders have perfected what political scientists call ""extraversion"" - positioning themselves as essential gatekeepers between international resources and their distribution domestically. This creates a perverse system where leaders benefit from maintaining economic dependency rather than fostering true development.

In 2020, Tanzania's President Magufuli claimed an 84% victory in elections widely criticized by the EU for lack of transparency. This follows a pattern across the continent where incumbents use state resources to suppress opposition and manipulate electoral processes.

What makes this possible? These leaders control crucial incoming financial flows:

* Export revenues (primarily from minerals and agricultural commodities)
* Foreign aid (constituting up to 90% of government budgets in countries like Ethiopia)
* International loans and investments

Instead of reinvesting these resources into diversifying their economies, ruling elites extract wealth to fuel patronage networks and offshore accounts. Angola's elite, for instance, has become one of the biggest investors in Portugal's economy while non-oil sectors at home remain starved of investment.

# The External Support Paradox

Perhaps most troubling is how Western nations often enable these authoritarian systems while claiming to champion democracy. Countries like Uganda and Rwanda receive substantial backing from Washington, London, and Paris despite their increasingly autocratic governance.

Why? These regimes are seen as guarantors of stability and valuable allies against threats like Al-Shabaab in Somalia. This creates a situation where:

1. Western powers provide legitimacy and resources to corrupt regimes
2. China offers no-strings-attached alternatives when Western pressure becomes inconvenient
3. Leaders can play these external actors against each other to maximize benefits

This undermines accountability and allows the perpetuation of local systems of inequality. As Yale historian Frederick Cooper notes, this produces ruling elites ""distant from the population it governed, exercising control over a narrow range of resources focused at the juncture of domestic and world economies.""

# Economic Stagnation and Growing Inequality

The consequences for ordinary Africans are severe. Despite narratives of ""Africa Rising,"" poverty remains endemic in many countries. The African Development Bank reports that in Nigeria, despite its oil wealth, poverty increased from 55% to 61% between 2004 and 2020, with the number of people living in poverty rising from 19 million in 1970 to 90 million by 2000.

With weak domestic tax bases and little incentive to develop independent business sectors, these economies remain vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and donor whims. Meanwhile, the disconnect between rulers and citizens grows wider.

# Is Change Possible?

Some hope may come from initiatives like the proposed African ""common market"" to allow free flow of people, goods, and capital between nations. The African Union's increasingly active peacekeeping role and efforts to hold former dictators accountable (like Hissène Habré's trial in Dakar) represent small steps toward greater accountability.

But until the fundamental economic structures enabling gatekeeper politics are addressed, Africa's ruling elites will likely continue refining their strategies for maintaining power while development stagnates.

What do you think can be done to break this cycle? Are there examples of African countries successfully moving beyond this pattern of governance?

Africa at a Crossroads: A Continent Trapped Between Superpowers,"Africa has long dreamt of true independence—an Africa free from the grip of foreign influence and self-inflicted wounds. From Kwame Nkrumah to Robert Mugabe to Julius Malema, the vision of a self-sufficient continent has echoed through generations. Yet, this dream remains just that—a dream. Former colonial powers with entrenched interests, combined with poor governance, rampant corruption, and ruthless dictatorships, have systematically undermined any real progress.

As of 2024, approximately 429 million Africans live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $2.15 per day. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia has shattered the chains of poverty, reducing extreme poverty from 65% in 1990 to just 1% by 2019. Africa, however, remains locked in a relentless struggle, where conflict, instability, and unchecked population growth keep millions trapped in hardship. For those who live here, this is not just a statistic—it is a daily reality.

Despite its challenges, Africa stands on the precipice of a rare opportunity. By 2030, it will have the world’s largest working-age population, coupled with vast natural resources capable of sustaining both itself and the global economy. But none of this will matter unless Africa confronts its governance failures and cracks down on corruption. This is no easy task. It requires visionary leadership with the foresight and determination to chart a new course.

While discussions about Africa’s development often revolve around infrastructure, trade, and investment, there is a far greater and more immediate challenge that Africa is dangerously unprepared for: the shifting global order and the battle for digital dominance.

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the global economic and geopolitical landscape. The post-World War II order—built on U.S. dominance, the Bretton Woods system, and Western-led globalization—is unraveling. In its place, a fractured global economy is emerging, led by two competing superpowers: the United States and China. Both nations understand this shift and are aggressively positioning themselves to secure economic and strategic advantages.

Africa, often dismissed as a passive player in global affairs, actually holds a unique position in this evolving landscape. For the first time in modern history, the continent has the ability to choose between two dominant forces. At first glance, China appears to be winning. Through massive infrastructure projects, direct investments, and expanding trade partnerships, China has entrenched itself in Africa’s economic framework. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has funneled billions into roads, railways, ports, and energy projects, often with fewer political conditions than Western aid. As a result, China-Africa trade has surged beyond $250 billion in recent years, dwarfing Africa’s trade with the U.S.

But while China dominates infrastructure and trade, the real battle between China and the U.S. is not about roads or bridges—it is about technology.

In the 21st century, the most valuable resource is not oil or minerals—it is data. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and digital services are reshaping the global economy, and whoever controls the data controls the future.

This presents a paradox for Africa. While China leads in infrastructure and trade, it keeps its most powerful tech companies inward-facing for strategic reasons. In contrast, the U.S. aggressively exports its technological dominance worldwide. From social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) to cloud services (Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), American tech companies have secured an unshakable grip on global data. Even TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, operates under a Western-modified version in Africa, subject to U.S. scrutiny.

Despite China's lead in infrastructure, Africa remains structurally bound to the U.S. and Europe. The continent's financial systems still run on the U.S. dollar and Western banking institutions. Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT dictate transactions, and many African central banks hold reserves in Western financial centers. Additionally, military alliances, educational exchanges, and cultural ties still tilt toward the West.

Europe, too, struggles with America’s technological dominance but naturally aligns with the U.S. due to shared political values, NATO, and historical ties. Africa, however, does not have the luxury of default alliances. It must navigate an increasingly polarized world where choosing between China and the U.S. is not just an economic decision—it is a geopolitical gamble.

If Africa does not prioritize digital independence, it risks becoming a permanent pawn in this global rivalry. The continent must develop its own tech industry, establish AI capabilities, and enact strong data sovereignty laws. Infrastructure financing from China offers short-term benefits, and American tech dominance provides convenience, but neither superpower has Africa’s long-term interests at heart.

The future will belong to those who control their own data, build self-sustaining digital ecosystems, and create industries that serve their people rather than foreign interests. If Africa fails to act now, it will find itself in the same position it has been in for centuries—rich in resources, yet exploited by external powers.

The question is not whether Africa will be part of the new world order. The real question is: Will Africa shape its own destiny, or will it once again be shaped by others?

Will Mogadishu Collapse in 2025?,"I genuinely don’t understand how Somalia is still functioning as a state right now. It might come down to sheer Somali resilience because from an outside perspective, it's hard to imagine the country holding together much longer. The Somali National Army appears seems sluggish and fearful, and from what I’ve seen, they're losing territory at an alarming rate.

Back during the Obama and Biden administrations, there seemed to be a clear American rationale for pushing back al-Shabaab. There was a belief that the group could potentially train terrorists who might later threaten American or Israeli interests, or destabilise the Horn of Africa more broadly. The horn is geopolitically crucial because of its proximity to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden which are major arteries of global trade.

But since Trump took office, al-Shabaab has gone on the offensive.They seem to be hoping to seize Mogadishu itself. I don’t see the U.S. maintaining the same level of commitment to Somalia’s defence as it did a decade ago, especiallt now that they cut USAID. Turkey seems to be stepping in, and while Turkey's isn't a military to sneeze at, it's not America.

I see parallels in Sudan, but the key difference is that the Sudanese military despite its flaws is better trained and armed than Somalia’s. From what I understand, Somali troops often retreat when faced with Islamist militants, or they simply refuse to engage unless they have backing from a local clan militia. The population is also deeply afraid of al-Shabaab, which makes sense. But fear doesn’t build a successful resistance movement.

Under these conditions, I can’t see a path to military victory for Somalia’s army. If al-Shabaab does manage to seize Mogadishu, I dread to see a future where the country collapses completely. Somaliland would probably be well positioned for global recognition if this happened. They might even engage in a brief conflict with the south over disputed territories. Somaliland has a significantly more organised military than Somalia. I could see Somaliland holding its own longer than Somalia.

Marshall Plan Equivalent,"Since America has decided to go back to being a protectionist instead of free market democracy economy this will leave a vacuum for world dominance that only Russia or China can fill. 

Africa is exposed. With a vast population that can provide numerous opportunities for countries to sell to; we suffer from a lack of infrastructure development. 

This is quite evident from the past failures of VC funds trying to set base and invest in companies that would become unicorns 🦄. 
It’s quite evident that no serious change can happen when most of our infrastructure needs aren’t met. 

How can we invent the next Facebook yet majority of Africans can’t access healthcare and running water. it’s like putting a cart before the horse. Enter the Marshal Plan. 

The Marshall Plan aimed to revitalize Western European economies and prevent the spread of communist influence in the aftermath of WWII. 

The Marshall Plan generated a resurgence of European industrialization and brought extensive investment into the region. It was also a stimulant to the U.S. economy by establishing markets for American goods.

China has the money and Africa desperately needs the investments. It can be a symbiotic partnership where both parties win. Africa could be the biggest market for China. 

I read somewhere that China’s exports to US stands at 14.7%. This is projected to further decrease thanks to the trade war with US and Africa can not only cushion the trade but also take a bigger chunk of the market. Since BYD and Huawei are officially banned this can be the chance for China to specifically target us as their first choice of market. They can set up shop and industries here while they focus on the design and research. 

Should China draw up a Marshall plan for countries with serious economic potential? Think of Kenya, SA, Nigeria and Egypt?

Personally, I feel like this is our chance to come out of poverty and be positioned at the center stage of world trade. We have everything that it takes to shape the future. Our politicians are a let down but not for long.

Nigeria's Oil Trouble and Trump's Tariffs,"Nigeria's 2025 budget is based on an oil price benchmark of $75 per barrel and a production target of 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd). However, oil prices have dropped to around $70 per barrel, with projections suggesting further declines to $60–$65 per barrel by late 2026.



Oil production has also fallen below the budgeted target, averaging only 1.5–1.7 million bpd in early 2025, further exacerbating revenue deficits.



The decline in oil prices and production could lead to a revenue gap of up to 6.6%. This could force the government to cut spending on critical sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, and education or resort to increased borrowing and taxation.



Nigeria’s fiscal deficit for 2025 is projected at Naira 18.9 trillion. The government has relied on Forward Sale Agreements (FSA) and other mechanisms to bridge funding gaps.



Nigerian oil industry is hampered by challenges such as poor infrastructure, transportation issues, security concerns and oil theft.

Also wouldn’t it have been way more effective to rather focus on pursing more legal campaigns against the United Arab Emirates  which is clearly funding the war. If the UAE didn’t fund the conflict the RSF would likely dissolve in a few days…it’s been two years with unceasing weapons and ammunition. Yet Sudan itself is basically destroyed ???  Which kinda doesn’t make sense how Sudan always has guns but no food? You get me? Also the lack of mention of the  many countries sponsoring the conflict in most of the wars coverage is proof of human evil at its finest. They know people will just write this off as another African war but 30 million people are starving to death. If they SAID this war is being sponsored by (X) people could take effective actions against said country and put a rapid end to the conflict. That’s like the entire population of Australia starving at once bro. 

Also, why would the first thing “Sudan” do to attack Kenya is stop **Food and Medicine from ENTERING (“IMPORT”) the country** when you have **14million internally (inside) in desperate need of Food and Medication.**? Like make that make sense? Everything else is good to come in 
tho….

Where are we with the Africa Continental Free Trade Area agreements?,"The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is (or rather *should be*) the largest free trade zone in the world by far. The AfCFTA is already much larger than the European Union and ASEAN. This is good, cause it means we have alot of consumers *and* producers.

The AfCFTA aims to reduce tariffs on 90% of goods traded between African countries, and remove non-tariff barriers like customs delays, and conflicting regulations. The point is to make trade between African nations easier by encouraging the development of regional supply chains and industries rather than the old model where raw materials leave Africa only for finished products to be sold back to us. If fully implemented, this could stimulate intra-African trade to grow by more than 50% from current levels (I think it's at like 15% right now. Europe is at 60 and Asia is at 30).

As of today, 48 African countries have ratified the agreementHowever, actual trade under AfCFTA rules is still super limited. To ease our way into it, a Guided Trade Initiative (GTI) was launched in late 2022. This pilot scheme currently includes Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania, Tunisia, and more recently South Africa. Only around a dozen countries have fully begun trading under AfCFTA protocols. The rest are still preparing.

I think part of the issue here is that not all African governments are equally interested or capable when it comes to free intra-African trade. Some fear loss of revenue from tariffs, others worry about exposing fragile domestic industries to competition. The other issues are ever-present in discussions about Africa; poor infrastructure and conflict in certain regions.

I still think this could and should be done before 2035. This is one of those things where we are only held back by how effective our governments are.

Kenya proposes to South Africa.... 🇰🇪🇿🇦,"In December of 2019, two strangers were among thousands of young people who had been invited to attend a prestigious program called World Youth Forum in the city of Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt. However, John Nyagaka from Kenya and Anathi Tshabe from South Africa were two worlds apart that were oblivious to their fate as they did not anticipate to be drawn into the embrace of a happy ending while pursuing their respective professional ambitions. 

As the days of the program progressed, and shortly after three days upon the inception, John states that he noticed Anathi wandering alone among other participants in an overwhelming crowd. He was in the company of a Nigerian friend when Anathi caught his attention and curiosity persuaded him to approach her. They engaged in a brief conversation while exchanging contact details. Anathi has expressed that John couldn't escape her eyes afterwards, and which is quite interesting as she had not identified him anywhere prior to their meeting. She disclosed that their love story is a testament to alignment - suggesting that John's appearance was not simply a coincidence, but rather a purposeful and divinely guided event in her life. John has equally expressed that their connection was a beautiful cliché of timing. They believe that they were in the right place at the right time. 

The conclusion of the program's duration in Egypt culminated in John and Anathi intending to keep in touch as they looked forward to a new year of uncertainty. They fostered a friendship to develop a foundation that would help them navigate compatibility. Anathi frequently visited Kenya to familiarize herself with John's immediate upbringing, and this involved following in the trails to his childhood in Kisii among other activities. On the other hand, John also extended the courtesy by embarking on trips to several parts of South Africa and particularly Anathi's home of Queenstown in the Eastern Cape province. John's heritage of Kisii alongside the Xhosa origins of Anathi present an intercultural affinity that has inspired a blend and balance of novelty in their love. The pair experienced the trust between their distance evolving into a stronger and closer intimacy. Without fail, they eventually transitioned into a genuine and enduring romantic relationship. 

In the near end of 2024, John set himself apart as a man with a sincere desire to commit to a lifetime with the start of a shared life. He carried a ring in his pocket and a promise in his heart as he gracefully walked into the sunset of Nungwi beach in Zanzibar to go down on one knee and ask for Anathi's hand in marriage. The successful outcome of the proposal had the couple jubilating in happiness and excitement for the beginning of a new life together. 

Anathi is an LLB graduate from the University of the Free State, and an admitted attorney of the High Court in South Africa. She recently completed a Masters of Management Science in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in China on a Schwarzman scholarship. John's background encompasses interests in education, information technology and health. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the Ashesi University and is currently studying a Masters program of Health Informatics at the University of Toronto in Canada to catalyse his passion for harnessing technology in healthcare systems. 

In spite of the aforementioned prospects, the engaged couple has adamantly reassured a priority to tie the knot and strive for a prosperous union.

Marshall Plan Equivalent,"Since America has decided to go back to being a protectionist instead of free market democracy economy this will leave a vacuum for world dominance that only Russia or China can fill. 

Africa is exposed. With a vast population that can provide numerous opportunities for countries to sell to; we suffer from a lack of infrastructure development. 

This is quite evident from the past failures of VC funds trying to set base and invest in companies that would become unicorns 🦄. 
It’s quite evident that no serious change can happen when most of our infrastructure needs aren’t met. 

How can we invent the next Facebook yet majority of Africans can’t access healthcare and running water. it’s like putting a cart before the horse. Enter the Marshal Plan. 

The Marshall Plan aimed to revitalize Western European economies and prevent the spread of communist influence in the aftermath of WWII. 

The Marshall Plan generated a resurgence of European industrialization and brought extensive investment into the region. It was also a stimulant to the U.S. economy by establishing markets for American goods.

China has the money and Africa desperately needs the investments. It can be a symbiotic partnership where both parties win. Africa could be the biggest market for China. 

I read somewhere that China’s exports to US stands at 14.7%. This is projected to further decrease thanks to the trade war with US and Africa can not only cushion the trade but also take a bigger chunk of the market. Since BYD and Huawei are officially banned this can be the chance for China to specifically target us as their first choice of market. They can set up shop and industries here while they focus on the design and research. 

Should China draw up a Marshall plan for countries with serious economic potential? Think of Kenya, SA, Nigeria and Egypt?

Personally, I feel like this is our chance to come out of poverty and be positioned at the center stage of world trade. We have everything that it takes to shape the future. Our politicians are a let down but not for long.

"It's not about minerals, Africa is to Europe what China is to the US - a potential/future threat.","I was watching the speech of a french senator addressing the situation that Europe finds itself in with the recent developments in the US and this part caught my attention.

> The global south is waiting for the outcome of this conflict to decide whether they should continue respecting Europe or trample over it


Of course we know who he was referring to, not Australia, they are an ally, it's not South America, obviously. He doesn't say Asia or middle East, no it's us. And yes maybe I am overthinking a simple statement, but I don't think that was a slipped tongue in such a well structured and delivered speech.

Now let me also make it clear that I don't think any African nation has any form of ambitions on Europe now or in the future(at least not that I know of), but it doesn't matter what I or most Africans think, it matters what Europe thinks we are thinking.

Africa is a failed mission for 19nth to 20th century Europe. You see, colonisation in Africa is often compared to colonisation in Asia, but they are not the same. In Asia, the mission was to get control of the trade. I'd assume the mission statement in European perspective was in the lines of 'those people have a lot of products and trade routes, but we have more arms, let's use our arms to take over the trade.'

 In Africa, the mission was to occupy, similar to what they did in Australia and the Americas. The mission was simple, 'go to that land, inhabit it, kill anybody who comes in your way.' However, unlike in Australia, the US, Canada etc, they didn't succeed in taking over the land, instead Africans struggled in various ways until they finally won.

So where do comparisons of Africa - Europe with China - US arise? Well, the US and China are 2 very different nations yet at the heart of it they have the same ambitions - to be the greatest nation of the earth/center of everything human species related. They both structured their societies differently, though. The US is an individualistic society, with individualistic philosophies from Rome and Greece being more dominant while China is a collectivist society with philosophies like Confucianism being more dominant. The US and China are 2 totally different societies and yet their ambitions means that they both can't succeed, one has to be the nation 'at the centre.' However, China was more of a long term threat and in the past US even worked with it to dominate the cold war. But still China remained it's biggest - potential/future - threat with Russia, more of the immediate threat.

As I said earlier, Africa is a European failed mission. From the perspective of Europe, Africa hates them and waits for a chance to be strong (or Europe weak) to take revenge. With this perspective, Europe, don't see a future where a strong Africa coexist with them. I think it's why the West handles African development projects like a hot potato. They are willing to spend on aid and other spendings that could help Africa, to maintain the 'we are not bad, we are friends you know' attitude without really helping in the development of the continent, the way the west invest in other places like Asia. In my opinion, neocolonialism is not about minerals, there are a lot of places in the world with minerals and weaker economies than African nations, that can be easily exploited. There are also African nations without that much minerals, so if it's about minerals, there wouldn't be much interference in their affairs. Neocolonialism is about keeping the beast that is Africa in check long enough to postpone (or even prevent depending on how future Africa interprets history) a war with Europe.

Again this is me trying to analyse the Europe elite class perspective of Africa based on a little statement. I could be wrong. I know most Africans don't really think of Africa as a threat to Europe (even a developed Africa). I'm also probably overthinking the statement, but it did come to my attention that his whole speech is about US - Europe - Ukraine and Russia, and yet he manages to sneak us there, not the middle east, not Asia - us. Kind of like how the US manages to sneak China in every speech about a threat even one unrelated to China. This is imo how him and probably a majority of Europe sees us.",Africa,Dangerous_Block_2494,2025-03-10 18:44:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/s/002EDX2e0Y,81,63,development aid kenya
Africa Needs Its Own Research & Innovation. Not Just Borrowed Systems,"In many African countries, we use almost everything from Europe, America, and Asia. laws, education systems, technologies, and even business models. But what do we have to show for ourselves? What if, instead of copying, we conducted our own research to understand what humanity truly needs—then implemented solutions tailored to our realities?  

Imagine an Africa where:  
- We develop our own technologies based on our unique challenges and resources.  
- We create laws and policies that reflect our cultures, economies, and people’s needs.  
- We invest in scientific research that leads to homegrown industries instead of importing everything.  
- We unite as a continent to build self-sustaining economies, rather than relying on external aid and foreign corporations.  

For this to happen, we need:  
1. Massive investment in R&D:, Governments, universities, and private sectors must prioritize research.  
2. A shift in mindset:,   Africans must believe in our own capabilities instead of always looking outward.  
3. Support for local innovation: Instead of waiting for Silicon Valley, why not build the next tech revolution right here?

When will we start believing in ourselves?

"From Tanzania to Zimbabwe: How Africa's Ruling Elite Stay in Power, Summarised","From Tanzania to Zimbabwe, Africa's ruling elites have mastered the art of staying in power. Our investigation reveals how they control foreign aid, export revenues, and patronage networks to maintain their grip while development stagnates.

# The ""Gatekeeper"" Mechanism

African leaders have perfected what political scientists call ""extraversion"" - positioning themselves as essential gatekeepers between international resources and their distribution domestically. This creates a perverse system where leaders benefit from maintaining economic dependency rather than fostering true development.

In 2020, Tanzania's President Magufuli claimed an 84% victory in elections widely criticized by the EU for lack of transparency. This follows a pattern across the continent where incumbents use state resources to suppress opposition and manipulate electoral processes.

What makes this possible? These leaders control crucial incoming financial flows:

* Export revenues (primarily from minerals and agricultural commodities)
* Foreign aid (constituting up to 90% of government budgets in countries like Ethiopia)
* International loans and investments

Instead of reinvesting these resources into diversifying their economies, ruling elites extract wealth to fuel patronage networks and offshore accounts. Angola's elite, for instance, has become one of the biggest investors in Portugal's economy while non-oil sectors at home remain starved of investment.

# The External Support Paradox

Perhaps most troubling is how Western nations often enable these authoritarian systems while claiming to champion democracy. Countries like Uganda and Rwanda receive substantial backing from Washington, London, and Paris despite their increasingly autocratic governance.

Why? These regimes are seen as guarantors of stability and valuable allies against threats like Al-Shabaab in Somalia. This creates a situation where:

1. Western powers provide legitimacy and resources to corrupt regimes
2. China offers no-strings-attached alternatives when Western pressure becomes inconvenient
3. Leaders can play these external actors against each other to maximize benefits

This undermines accountability and allows the perpetuation of local systems of inequality. As Yale historian Frederick Cooper notes, this produces ruling elites ""distant from the population it governed, exercising control over a narrow range of resources focused at the juncture of domestic and world economies.""

# Economic Stagnation and Growing Inequality

The consequences for ordinary Africans are severe. Despite narratives of ""Africa Rising,"" poverty remains endemic in many countries. The African Development Bank reports that in Nigeria, despite its oil wealth, poverty increased from 55% to 61% between 2004 and 2020, with the number of people living in poverty rising from 19 million in 1970 to 90 million by 2000.

With weak domestic tax bases and little incentive to develop independent business sectors, these economies remain vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and donor whims. Meanwhile, the disconnect between rulers and citizens grows wider.

# Is Change Possible?

Some hope may come from initiatives like the proposed African ""common market"" to allow free flow of people, goods, and capital between nations. The African Union's increasingly active peacekeeping role and efforts to hold former dictators accountable (like Hissène Habré's trial in Dakar) represent small steps toward greater accountability.

But until the fundamental economic structures enabling gatekeeper politics are addressed, Africa's ruling elites will likely continue refining their strategies for maintaining power while development stagnates.

What do you think can be done to break this cycle? Are there examples of African countries successfully moving beyond this pattern of governance?

Kéré’s design incorporates traditional materials like laterite and earth to naturally cool the interior, minimizing the need for air conditioning. The site will include an 87-meter-high tower, an amphitheater, and preserved remnants of the original attack location. The project emphasizes sustainability, community involvement, and honoring Sankara’s legacy of social justice and development.
Kéré met Sankara when he came to speak to students in Fada Ngourma, the capital of Burkina Faso's Eastern region and he finds building his place of rest as a testament to the power of architecture.

Africa at a Crossroads: A Continent Trapped Between Superpowers,"Africa has long dreamt of true independence—an Africa free from the grip of foreign influence and self-inflicted wounds. From Kwame Nkrumah to Robert Mugabe to Julius Malema, the vision of a self-sufficient continent has echoed through generations. Yet, this dream remains just that—a dream. Former colonial powers with entrenched interests, combined with poor governance, rampant corruption, and ruthless dictatorships, have systematically undermined any real progress.

As of 2024, approximately 429 million Africans live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $2.15 per day. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia has shattered the chains of poverty, reducing extreme poverty from 65% in 1990 to just 1% by 2019. Africa, however, remains locked in a relentless struggle, where conflict, instability, and unchecked population growth keep millions trapped in hardship. For those who live here, this is not just a statistic—it is a daily reality.

Despite its challenges, Africa stands on the precipice of a rare opportunity. By 2030, it will have the world’s largest working-age population, coupled with vast natural resources capable of sustaining both itself and the global economy. But none of this will matter unless Africa confronts its governance failures and cracks down on corruption. This is no easy task. It requires visionary leadership with the foresight and determination to chart a new course.

While discussions about Africa’s development often revolve around infrastructure, trade, and investment, there is a far greater and more immediate challenge that Africa is dangerously unprepared for: the shifting global order and the battle for digital dominance.

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the global economic and geopolitical landscape. The post-World War II order—built on U.S. dominance, the Bretton Woods system, and Western-led globalization—is unraveling. In its place, a fractured global economy is emerging, led by two competing superpowers: the United States and China. Both nations understand this shift and are aggressively positioning themselves to secure economic and strategic advantages.

Africa, often dismissed as a passive player in global affairs, actually holds a unique position in this evolving landscape. For the first time in modern history, the continent has the ability to choose between two dominant forces. At first glance, China appears to be winning. Through massive infrastructure projects, direct investments, and expanding trade partnerships, China has entrenched itself in Africa’s economic framework. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has funneled billions into roads, railways, ports, and energy projects, often with fewer political conditions than Western aid. As a result, China-Africa trade has surged beyond $250 billion in recent years, dwarfing Africa’s trade with the U.S.

But while China dominates infrastructure and trade, the real battle between China and the U.S. is not about roads or bridges—it is about technology.

In the 21st century, the most valuable resource is not oil or minerals—it is data. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and digital services are reshaping the global economy, and whoever controls the data controls the future.

This presents a paradox for Africa. While China leads in infrastructure and trade, it keeps its most powerful tech companies inward-facing for strategic reasons. In contrast, the U.S. aggressively exports its technological dominance worldwide. From social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) to cloud services (Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), American tech companies have secured an unshakable grip on global data. Even TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, operates under a Western-modified version in Africa, subject to U.S. scrutiny.

Despite China's lead in infrastructure, Africa remains structurally bound to the U.S. and Europe. The continent's financial systems still run on the U.S. dollar and Western banking institutions. Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT dictate transactions, and many African central banks hold reserves in Western financial centers. Additionally, military alliances, educational exchanges, and cultural ties still tilt toward the West.

Europe, too, struggles with America’s technological dominance but naturally aligns with the U.S. due to shared political values, NATO, and historical ties. Africa, however, does not have the luxury of default alliances. It must navigate an increasingly polarized world where choosing between China and the U.S. is not just an economic decision—it is a geopolitical gamble.

If Africa does not prioritize digital independence, it risks becoming a permanent pawn in this global rivalry. The continent must develop its own tech industry, establish AI capabilities, and enact strong data sovereignty laws. Infrastructure financing from China offers short-term benefits, and American tech dominance provides convenience, but neither superpower has Africa’s long-term interests at heart.

The future will belong to those who control their own data, build self-sustaining digital ecosystems, and create industries that serve their people rather than foreign interests. If Africa fails to act now, it will find itself in the same position it has been in for centuries—rich in resources, yet exploited by external powers.

The question is not whether Africa will be part of the new world order. The real question is: Will Africa shape its own destiny, or will it once again be shaped by others?

Why the EAC Was More Effective Than SADC in Keeping Peace in the DRC.,"
The DRC has been a theater of instability in the region for years now, with numerous armed groups, weak state institutions, and vast mineral wealth feeding the war. The two regional blocs, the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community, have tried to stabilize the country over the past years, with very different results: whereas the EAC's regional force succeeded in largely defusing the situation, the intervention by SADC has been marred by procrastination and strategic blunders.

This therefore brings out a number of questions as to why EAC was more successful than SADC in bringing peace in the DRC. The reasons for this combination relate to geopolitical interests, military strategy, political will, and logistical capacity.

Geopolitical Interests and Proximity

The EAC had a more direct stake in the DRC conflict compared to SADC. Several EAC member states, including Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, and Tanzania, have economic and security interests related to the stability of eastern DRC. Historically, the region has seen intense involvement from Uganda and Rwanda, at times supporting different armed groups and competing for control over the regional resources. To Kenya, the DRC is seen as one of the giant economic hubs into which it ought to expand and increase trade, while Burundi shares security concerns with Sudan resulting from cross-border instability.

This proximity gave the EAC a greater sense of urgency to act swiftly and effectively. Unlike SADC, which is dominated by states like South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe—countries located far from the DRC—the EAC members viewed the crisis as a regional security threat that required immediate attention.

Military Deployment and Strategic Approach

The EAC was more effective and flexible in its military operation. It deployed the EACRF at the end of 2022 with troops from Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan quickly moving into key conflict areas such as Goma, Bunagana, and Rutshuru. With that speed, EACRF attained an advantage over strategic locations, while several armed groups, such as M23, could not expand their captured territories.

One of the reasons why EACRF had been successful was that they maintained a proper balance between military presence and diplomacy: Kenyan leadership played a pivotal role in negotiating temporary ceasefires and direct contacts with rebel groups. Partial withdrawals without heavy fighting prevented unnecessary escalation. Such limited withdrawals have given way to a long-term political solution.

Serious setbacks were also suffered in deployment by the SADC Force, which relied mostly on conventional warfare. By the time the SADC forces arrived in the theatre of operations, the dynamics on the ground had changed and the rebel groups had adapted. SADC has a history of going on full military intervention, as witnessed in Lesotho (1998) and the DRC (1998-2003); hence, less emphasis is placed on the art of diplomacy, but much emphasis is given to outright combat, which hasn't largely worked in the current DRC crisis.

Political Will and Coordination

The other principal divide between the two blocs was the expression of political coordination. The EAC demonstrated coherence and commitment toward the peacekeeping mission. Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania provided a united diplomatic intervention, supported by Burundi with troop deployment for border regional stabilization. All these put together meant swift decisions with a focused direction in trying to contain the crisis.

By comparison, SADC had to grapple with internal divisions as a result of how best to handle the conflict in the DRC. South Africa, traditionally the dominant player within SADC, was reluctant to commit large resources due to domestic challenges. The presence of national strategic interests within the DRC by Angola and Zimbabwe complicated consensus on a military and diplomatic strategy for SADC. Its intervention thus proved slower, more reactive, and less effective than the EACRF mission.

Logistical and Economic Benefits

Logistics was also very instrumental in this intervention of EAC. A well-equipped Kenyan military with advanced infrastructure was strategically positioned, hence ensuring rapid deployment of its troops with sustained supply chains. Nairobi was equally important in a logistical way because it guaranteed reinforcement and resupply to EACRF forces that were involved in operations within DRC.

On the other hand, SADC lacked a coherent logistical base. Its forces had to be moved over long distances. This led to delays in reinforcements, supply deficiencies, and operational inefficiencies. Again this diminished the capacity of SADC to effectively make a timely intervention.
Impact and Future Implications

The relatively successful approach of the EAC in the DRC goes to demonstrate that regional organizations with direct stakes in the conflicts are often better placed in mediating and stabilizing such crises. The EACRF, while not without limitations such as inability to completely disarm the M23 rebels, at least succeeded in preventing further escalation and in creating conditions for dialogue.

SADC needs to change its intervention strategy in the DRC if it is to be more effective. It should instead focus on diplomatic engagement, better coordination with the Congolese government, and preparedness on the part of SADC's military machinery. Otherwise, SADC risks prolonging the conflict rather than resolving it.

My opinion:

The reason the intervention of the East African Community in the DRC was somewhat more successful compared to SADC's has to do with several important reasons: stronger geopolitical interests, high speed, political coordination, and a well-balanced military-diplomatic approach. Meanwhile, SADC suffered from slow deployment, internal divisions, and reliance on conventional military tactics that prevented it from making any meaningful impact.

Regional peacekeeping operations in Africa going forward need to be characterized more by speed, adaptability, and regional cooperation rather than mere military intervention. If the objective is lasting peace in the DRC, then diplomatic engagement and well-planned interventions strategically implemented-as in this approach by EAC-will far outmatch the use of brute force.",Africa,kijanafupinonoround,2025-02-03 03:44:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1igg38h/why_the_eac_was_more_effective_than_sadc_in/,18,3,development aid kenya

Marshall Plan Equivalent,"Since America has decided to go back to being a protectionist instead of free market democracy economy this will leave a vacuum for world dominance that only Russia or China can fill. 

Africa is exposed. With a vast population that can provide numerous opportunities for countries to sell to; we suffer from a lack of infrastructure development. 

This is quite evident from the past failures of VC funds trying to set base and invest in companies that would become unicorns 🦄. 
It’s quite evident that no serious change can happen when most of our infrastructure needs aren’t met. 

How can we invent the next Facebook yet majority of Africans can’t access healthcare and running water. it’s like putting a cart before the horse. Enter the Marshal Plan. 

The Marshall Plan aimed to revitalize Western European economies and prevent the spread of communist influence in the aftermath of WWII. 

The Marshall Plan generated a resurgence of European industrialization and brought extensive investment into the region. It was also a stimulant to the U.S. economy by establishing markets for American goods.

China has the money and Africa desperately needs the investments. It can be a symbiotic partnership where both parties win. Africa could be the biggest market for China. 

I read somewhere that China’s exports to US stands at 14.7%. This is projected to further decrease thanks to the trade war with US and Africa can not only cushion the trade but also take a bigger chunk of the market. Since BYD and Huawei are officially banned this can be the chance for China to specifically target us as their first choice of market. They can set up shop and industries here while they focus on the design and research. 

Should China draw up a Marshall plan for countries with serious economic potential? Think of Kenya, SA, Nigeria and Egypt?

Personally, I feel like this is our chance to come out of poverty and be positioned at the center stage of world trade. We have everything that it takes to shape the future. Our politicians are a let down but not for long. 

What do you think? Am I wrong? Does Africa stand to gain from the fight?",Africa,Alternative_Cap_8542,2025-04-12 03:17:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1jx7ysc/marshall_plan_equivalent/,8,10,kenya donor funding

Why???

How does this make any sense? If you realize that Kenya is warming up to a psychotic mass murder why not get the African Union Involved. Kenya is a member of the AU and this has to be some sort of violation that Sudan can leverage? Especially in an International court? 

Also wouldn’t it have been way more effective to rather focus on pursing more legal campaigns against the United Arab Emirates  which is clearly funding the war. If the UAE didn’t fund the conflict the RSF would likely dissolve in a few days…it’s been two years with unceasing weapons and ammunition. Yet Sudan itself is basically destroyed ???  Which kinda doesn’t make sense how Sudan always has guns but no food? You get me? Also the lack of mention of the  many countries sponsoring the conflict in most of the wars coverage is proof of human evil at its finest. They know people will just write this off as another African war but 30 million people are starving to death. If they SAID this war is being sponsored by (X) people could take effective actions against said country and put a rapid end to the conflict. That’s like the entire population of Australia starving at once bro. 

Also, why would the first thing “Sudan” do to attack Kenya is stop **Food and Medicine from ENTERING (“IMPORT”) the country** when you have **14million internally (inside) in desperate need of Food and Medication.**? Like make that make sense? Everything else is good to come in
