Essential treatments are often neither available nor affordable in these nations, even decades after the drugs entered the market.

Prospective buyers from these countries face a patent thicket, where a single drug may be covered by hundreds of patents. This makes it costly and legally difficult to secure licensing rights for manufacturing.

These buyers also face a complex and often fragile supply chain. Many major pharmaceutical firms have little incentive to sell their products in unprofitable markets. Quality assurance adds another layer of complexity, with substandard and counterfeit drugs widespread in many of these countries.

Organizations such as the United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool have effectively increased the supply of generic versions of patented drugs. But the problems go beyond patents or manufacturing – how medicines are bought are also crucially important. Buyers for low- and middle-income countries are often health ministries and community organizations on tight budgets that have to negotiate with sellers that may have substantial market power and far more experience.

We are economists who study how to increase access to drugs across the globe. Our research found that while pooling orders for essential medicines can help drive down costs and ensure a steady supply to low- and middle-income countries, there are trade-offs that require flexibility and early planning to address.

Understanding these trade-offs can help countries better prepare for future health emergencies and treat chronic conditions.

Pooled procurement reduces drug costs

One strategy low-income countries are increasingly adopting to improve treatment access is “pooled procurement.” That’s when multiple buyers coordinate purchases to strengthen their collective bargaining power and reduce prices for essential medicines. For example, pooling can help buyers meet the minimum batch size requirements some suppliers impose that countries purchasing individually may not satisfy.

Countries typically rely on four models for pooled drug procurement:

One method, called decentralized procurement, involves buyers purchasing directly from manufacturers.

Another method, called international pooled procurement, involves going through international institutions such as the Global Fund’s Pooled Procurement Mechanism or the United Nations.

Countries may also purchase prescription drugs through their own central medical stores, which are government-run or semi-autonomous agencies that procure, store and distribute medicines on behalf of national health systems. This method is called centralized domestic procurement.

Finally, countries can also go through independent nonprofits, foundations, nongovernmental organizations and private wholesalers.

We wanted to understand how different procurement methods affect the cost of and time it takes to deliver drugs for HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, because those three infectious diseases account for a large share of deaths and cases worldwide. So we analyzed over 39,000 drug procurement transactions across 106 countries between 2007 and 2017 that were funded by the Global Fund, the largest multilateral funder of HIV/AIDS programs worldwide.

We found that pooled procurement through international institutions reduced prices by 13% to 20% compared with directly buying from drug manufacturers. Smaller buyers and those purchasing drugs produced by only a small number of manufacturers saw the greatest savings. In comparison, purchasing through domestic pooling offered less consistent savings, with larger buyers seeing greater price advantages.

The Global Fund and the United Nations were especially effective at lowering the prices of older, off-patent drugs.

Trade-offs with pooled procurements

Cost savings from pooled drug procurement may come with trade-offs.

While the Global Fund reduced unexpected delivery delays by 28%, it required buyers to place orders much earlier. This results in longer anticipated procurement lead time between ordering and delivery – an average of 114 days more than that of direct purchases. In contrast, domestic pooled procurement shortened lead times by over a month.

Our results suggest a core tension: Pooled procurement improves prices and reliability but can reduce flexibility. Organizations that facilitate pooled procurement tend to prioritize medicines that can be bought at high volume, limiting the availability of other types of drugs. Additionally, the longer lead times may not be suitable for emergency situations.

With the spread of COVID-19, several large armed conflicts and tariff wars, governments have become increasingly aware of the fragility of the global supply chain. Some countries, such as Kenya, have sought to reduce their dependence on international pooling since 2005 by investing in domestic procurement.

But a shift toward domestic self-sufficiency is a slow and difficult process due to challenges with quality assurance and large-scale manufacturing. It may also weaken international pooled systems, which rely on broad participation to negotiate better terms with suppliers.

Interestingly, we found little evidence that international pooled procurement influences pricing for the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a major purchaser of HIV treatments for developing countries. PEPFAR-eligible products do not appear to benefit more from international pooled procurement than noneligible ones.

However, domestic procurement institutions were able to secure lower prices for PEPFAR-eligible products. This suggests that the presence of a large donor such as PEPFAR can cut costs, particularly when countries manage procurement internally.

USAID cuts and global drug access

While international organizations such as the Medicines Patent Pool and the Global Fund can address upstream barriers such as patents and procurement in the global drug supply chain, other institutions are essential for ensuring that medicines actually reach patients.

The U.S. Agency for International Development had played a significant role in delivering HIV treatment abroad through PEPFAR. The Trump administration’s decision in February 2025 to cut over 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts amounted to a US$60 billion reduction in overall U.S. assistance globally. An estimated hundreds of thousands of deaths are already happening, and millions more will likely die.

The World Health Organization warned that eight countries, including Haiti, Kenya, Nigeria and Ukraine, could soon run out of HIV treatments due to these aid cuts. In South Africa, HIV services have already been scaled back, with reports of mass layoffs of health workers and HIV clinic closures. These downstream cracks can undercut the gains from efforts to make procuring drugs more accessible if the drugs can’t reach patients.

Because HIV, tuberculosis and malaria often share the same treatment infrastructure – including drug procurement and distribution networks, laboratory systems, data collection, health workers and community-based services – disruption in the management of one disease can ripple across the others. Researchers have warned of a broader unraveling of progress across these infectious diseases, describing the fallout as a potential “bloodbath” in the global HIV response.

Research shows that supporting access to treatments around the world doesn’t just save lives abroad. It also helps prevent the next global health crisis from reaching America’s doorstep."

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Jun 17 2025 (IPS) - Wars, economic shocks, planetary heating and aid cuts have worsened food crises in recent years, with almost 300 million people now threatened by starvation.



World food production has increased almost fourfold since 1960 FAO statistics indicate enough output to feed the world’s eight billion plus another three billion!

Clearly, inadequate food due to population growth cannot explain persistent hunger. Yet, the number of hungry people has been rising for more than a decade. So, why are so many hungry if there is more than enough food for all?

The multi-stakeholder 2025 Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) notes 2024 was the sixth consecutive year of high and growing acute food insecurity, with 295.3 million people starving!

In 2023, 733 million people experienced chronic hunger. Over a fifth (22.6%) of the 53 countries/territories assessed in this year’s GRFC were especially vulnerable.

Food output in 2024 continued to rise. In 2022, the world produced 11 billion metric tonnes of food, including 9.6 billion tonnes of cereal crops, such as maize, rice and wheat.

Most hungry people are poor. The poverty line is supposed to reflect the poor’s ability to afford basic needs, mainly food. But the discrepancy between poverty and hunger trends implies inconsistent data and definitions.

Over 700 million worldwide survive on less than $2.15 daily without enough food. Presumably, the 3.4 billion with less than $5.50 daily can barely afford enough nutrition.

New World Bank data estimates 838 million, 10.5% of the world’s population, were in extreme poverty in 2022, 125 million more than previously estimated. It expects one in ten (9.9%) to be in extreme poverty in 2025, with about 750 million hungry.

The extreme poverty line is now $3/day instead of $2.15/day. The poor comprised almost half (48%) the world’s population in 2022. With bleak medium-term growth prospects and inequality still growing, their prospects look especially dismal.

While dietary or caloric energy is essential for human activity, adequate dietary diversity is crucial for human nutrition. Hence, the poor typically cannot afford to eat enough, let alone healthily.

Women and girls are generally more likely to go hungry than men, with hunger rates in women-headed households usually higher. UN-recognized ‘indigenous peoples’ are under 5% of the world’s population but account for 15% of the extreme poor, suffering more hunger than others.

Why food crises?

The multi-stakeholder 2025 Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) notes 2024 was the sixth consecutive year of high and growing acute food insecurity, with 295.3 million people starving!

Worsening conflicts, economic crises, deep funding cuts and less humanitarian assistance all threaten food security. As planetary heating worsens, those experiencing acute food insecurity will likely increase again this year.

Food insecurity has worsened in 19 countries/territories, mainly due to internal conflicts, as in Myanmar, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Even before the aid cuts, half the countries/territories featured in GRFC 2025 faced food crises. Despite La Niña rains, droughts in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan are expected to worsen.

USAID and other recent aid cuts have defunded food programmes for over 14 million children in Sudan, Yemen and Haiti alone. G7 countries are expected to cut aid by 28% in 2026 from 2024. Meanwhile, the GRFC 2025 reported humanitarian food assistance “declined by 30 percent in 2023, and again in 2024”!

In 2024, 65.9 million in Asia were food insecure, the worst in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Food crises threatened 33.5 million, or 44% of those in the eight MENA territories assessed in GRFC 2025.

Starvation as weapon

The number of starving people more than doubled in 2024! Over 95% of this increase was in the Gaza Strip or Sudan. Wars destroy and disrupt food production and distribution. A famine was declared in Sudan in December 2024, with more than 24 million starving due to the civil war.

Sudan has the largest land area for farming in Africa. Two-thirds of Sudan’s population relies on agriculture, but the ongoing conflict has caused the destruction and abandonment of much farmland and infrastructure.

Despite the Sudanese military’s devastating factional war, the country remains the world’s largest exporter of oily seeds (groundnuts, safflower, sesame, soybean, and sunflower), reflecting its agronomic potential.

Many more are starving in Haiti, Mali, and South Sudan. The UN’s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) deems such starvation, death, destitution and severe acute malnutrition “catastrophic”.

Food deprivation has become the primary Israeli weapon against the people of Gaza. Gaza’s 2.1 million Palestinians have been at “critical risk” of famine due to the Israeli blockade on food and humanitarian aid since October 2023!

Despite official Israeli denial of mass starvation, growing international outrage, including from some of its staunchest allies, has forced the Netanyahu government to gloss over its actions. In May, it set up the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to “calibrate” calorie rations to continue starvation but not to death.

But do frameworks for ethically managing healthcare worker emigration make a real difference? Tine Hanrieder and Leon Janauschek argue that while these approaches can provide some benefits, they have far too many shortcomings to be considered good practice.

Health services in developing countries are deeply impacted by the aid freezes and cuts imposed by high-income countries – of which the shutdown of USAID is only the most dramatic instance.

One recent estimate, covering the 32 member states of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, projects that the reduction in development assistance for health in these countries will increase the projected health and care workforce shortage in Africa by 600,000 workers by 2030, compared to previous projections. This only adds to a dire lack of health workers worldwide, which the World Health Organization estimated to amount to 14.7 million in 2024, before the latest wave of announced aid cuts.

In parallel, many of the countries that are slashing their development aid have become ever more aggressive when it comes to poaching poorer countries’ health workers. The UK’s Royal College of Nursing found that countries on the WHO’s safeguards list (those facing the most critical workforce shortage) have suffered major cuts in UK aid – while at the same time, nurses from these countries filled some twenty thousand vacancies in the UK between 2020 and 2024.

The managed migration of health workers

Many countries in Africa, as well as in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, struggle with health worker emigration. They seek to mitigate its impact but often cannot offer jobs and conditions that would retain a workforce that has taken years to train, often with public resources.

To mitigate the health workforce brain-drain, but also to make migration journeys less risky and vulnerable to exploitation, global health policy makers promote standards in line with the broader “managed migration agenda”. They refer to key documents such as the United Nations’ 2018 Global Compact for Migration and, most importantly, the WHO’s 2010 Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, which sets soft standards for “ethical recruitment”.

In a future where aid is expected to become more transactional, and where the rise of anti-migration discourses across the “West” makes migratory pathways ever more erratic and hazardous, managing health worker migration “ethically” might seem desirable. But do these approaches simply amount to “ethics washing” by making the emigration of healthcare workers appear superficially ethical without addressing any of the underlying harms caused?

The short answer is that while ethical recruitment can have a positive impact, it has too many shortcomings to be considered good practice. The longer answer, drawing on our recent in-depth research on Germany – one of the “model countries” for ethical recruitment – is that there are four main areas where current practice falls short.

Insights from Germany

Germany promotes its ethical recruitment of nurses internationally, is praised as a best practice recruiter by global policy bodies and is celebrated as the shining counterexample to the UK’s recruitment practices in newspapers such as The Guardian. Through myriad initiatives, including the public nurse recruitment scheme Triple Win and a voluntary fairness certificate for private recruiters, the country aims to fill gaps in its health system with foreign-trained workers in an “ethical” way.

It does so by making nurse migration journeys more predictable, letting employers pay for the costs of migration, reining in the use of binding clauses that would tie workers to certain employers, and ensuring equal treatment of immigrant nurses in German workplaces. While this does set some good examples, especially for nurses joining well-resourced university hospitals, the win-win-win rhetoric of “ethical recruitment” leaves major inequities unaddressed.

First, even “well-managed” cases of nurse migration to Germany are burdensome and exploitative. The administrative limbos, Kafkaesque paperwork, and arbitrary decision-making regarding visa decisions and skill recognition test the endurance of immigrant nurses for months, often years.

The gap between arriving in Germany with a “certificate of deficits” and finally working as a professional nurse takes up to one and a half years, sometimes longer. While waiting, the nurses who are already professionals work for lower pay as nurse aides – a classic case of deskilling discussed amply in the migration literature.

Second, the postulated “win” for the sending countries is not enough. The WHO urges countries to manage health workforce migration through bilateral agreements that specify a benefit for the sending country, and stresses that this benefit must go beyond (assumed or real) remittance payments to folks back home. Yet, German players in the growing recruitment industry deflect demands for mutual benefit or compensation.

The country’s bilateral agreements – which we obtained through freedom of information requests – do not entail any such compensation, and are rarely inclusive of relevant health sector voices that might put such demands forward. The same holds for almost all other bilateral health worker migration agreements on record. If you consider the cost of training health workers – training a nurse in Kenya, for example, requires some $43,000 in education costs – nurse migration from poor to rich countries remains a highly unequal exchange, if not a neo-colonial extractivist practice, that inhibits source countries’ push for universal health coverage.

Third, “red lists” only create illusions of protection. The WHO’s Health workforce support and safeguards list accompanies the Global Code of Practice. It is periodically updated to indicate in which countries no “active recruitment” should take place. Yet, the line between active recruitment – for example by recruitment agencies – and mere openness to applications from candidates is becoming ever blurrier as information about job and migration opportunities circulates online and through migrant and professional networks.

German regulators and recruiters all point to respecting the red list and consider this a satisfactory response to the brain drain problem. However, even countries that are “not red” such as the Philippines or Colombia struggle with health worker shortages. The safeguards list thus provides a false sense of assurance that these countries are safe to recruit from and employers need not be concerned about compensation and health equity trade-offs. Additionally, governments and workers in countries that are on the list have criticised it since, for unemployed workers, even if living in a country with shortages, safe and managed emigration might be the only alternative to leaving their profession altogether.

Fourth and finally, even ethical recruitment practices such as, for example, paying for migration costs or offering support with integration after arrival in the new country, do not address ingrained problems in the (German) healthcare industry. This includes work intensification and early burnout.

Hundreds of thousands of nurses in Germany are reported to have left the profession due to the conditions in the sector, conditions that migrants are expected to cope with on top of all the investments they have to make to try and thrive in Germany. Furthermore, discrimination and racist aggressions, which can come from colleagues as well as from patients, are impacting the work and wellbeing of many migrant nurses. Flagship projects in ethical recruitment do not address such underlying issues.

The need for change

In sum, ethical recruitment is more than ethics washing when migrants are protected against deception or against visas tied to certain employers. Its ideals in terms of worker protection should be more fully and more bindingly implemented. But using this discourse as a legitimation for unfettered health workforce extraction from the Global South is unjust.

Countries of origin should receive compensation for their qualified workers that goes beyond the illusions of remittance alchemy. At least, in the next generation of bilateral health workforce recruitment agreements, health sector stakeholders should be more systematically included and enabled to negotiate a health dividend for their countries and most underserved regions.

ABlack History Month event, canceled. A lab working to fight hunger, shuttered. Student visas revoked, then reinstated, at least for now. Opportunities for students pursuing science careers fading.

The first six months of the Trump administration have brought a hailstorm of changes to the nation’s colleges and universities. While the president’s face-offs with Harvard and Columbia have generated the most attention, students on campuses throughout the country are noticing the effects of the administration’s cuts to scientific and medical research, its clampdown on any efforts promoting diversity equity and inclusion (DEI), newly aggressive policies for students with loan debt, the revocation of visas for international students, and more.

Many of the administration’s actions are being challenged in court, but they are influencing the way students interact with each other, what support they can get from their institutions—and even whether they feel safe in this nation.

The Hechinger Report traveled to campuses around the country to look at what these changes mean for students. Reporters visited universities in four states—California, Illinois, Louisiana, and Texas—to understand this new era for higher education.

Louisiana State University

Baton Rouge—Last fall, Louisiana State University student A’shawna Smith had an idea for a new campus group to educate students about their legal rights and broader problems in the criminal justice system. Smith, a sociology major, had spent the prior summer interning at a law firm and noticed how many clients didn’t know their rights after an arrest.

Smith, now a rising senior, called it Injustice Reform and soon recruited classmates and a campus adviser. They wrote a mission statement and trained as student group leaders. On February 20, LSU’s student government, which awards money to campus groups that comes from student fees, gave them $1,200; Smith and her classmates planned to use the award to recruit members and organize events.

But on April 8, Injustice Reform’s treasurer received a text message from Cortney Greavis, LSU’s student government adviser. She said LSU was rescinding the money: The group’s mission statement ran afoul of new federal and state restrictions on DEI. Its mission mentions racial disparities and police brutality, but the organizers were never told which words violated the rules. Smith and fellow leaders started chipping in their own money to keep the group going: $10 here and there, whatever they could afford, said Bella Porché, a rising senior on the group’s executive board.

Canceling awards to student groups is one way students say administrators at LSU, the state’s flagship university, have restricted what they can do and say since the US Department of Education wrote to schools and colleges nationwide on Valentine’s Day. The letter described DEI efforts—designed to rectify current and historic discrimination—as discriminatory and threatened schools with the loss of federal money unless they ended the consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, housing, training, and other practices.

Since the letter, discussion of DEI on campus “has become an anti-gay, anti-Black sort of conversation,” said Emma Miller, a rising senior and elected student senator. “People who are minorities don’t feel safe anymore, don’t feel represented, don’t feel seen, because DEI is being wiped away and their university is not saying anything.”

In a March 7 report, the university detailed dozens of changes made to comply with the letter’s demands. For example, it ended any preference granted to students from historically underrepresented groups for certain privately funded scholarships; opened membership in school-funded student organizations—like a women-in-business group—to all; and canceled activities perceived to emphasize race, even a fitness class kicking off Black History Month.

Student government leaders say the restrictions hinder their ability to operate. Rising junior Tyhlar Holliway, a member of the student government’s Black Caucus, said school administrators essentially shut down the caucus’s proposal that the student government issue a statement after the Department of Education letter in support of DEI programs and initiatives.

LSU public relations staff did not respond to interview requests or to an e-mailed list of questions, and the school’s civil rights and Title IX division director declined to speak.

Miller said administrators have told student leaders that all their proposed legislation must be reviewed by the school’s general counsel for compliance with the March 7 guidelines. The administration, for example, blocked a student government bill to fund a Black hair-care event designed to help students prepare for career and professional opportunities, said senior Paris Holman, a student government member. “We have conferences and interviews and need to know how to take care of our hair,” said Holman, who is Black.

Students have also tailored the language of other bills to avoid the appearance of support for DEI. Holman said that in one case the student senate changed the language in a bill funding an end-of-year event for a minority student organization to remove any reference to the organization as serving minority students.

The school also overrode student government decisions about which groups, like A’shawna Smith’s, could be funded by student fees. In February, the student government voted to provide $641 to help a pre-med student, who is Black, attend a student medical education conference, in part so she could share what she’d learn with other pre-med students. A few weeks later, she received an e-mail from Greavis, the student government adviser, saying she wouldn’t be able to attend with university funds because that money could no longer be used for “DEI-related events, initiatives, programs, or travel.” Greavis didn’t respond to requests for an interview.

The e-mail didn’t specify why the medical conference crossed the line. But the sponsoring organization’s mission statement notes its commitment to “supporting current and future underrepresented minority medical students,” and a conference plenary speaker was scheduled to address the “enduring case for DEI in medicine.” Fewer than 6 percent of doctors are Black and research has shown improved health outcomes for Black patients who are seen by physicians of the same race.

“It doesn’t feel like a democracy,” said Holman of serving in student government at this moment.

She and other students say the university’s actions are starting to change the broader culture at LSU, which serves nearly 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its campus of Italian Renaissance buildings shaded by magnolias and Southern live oaks. About 60 percent of students are white and 18 percent are Black, according to federal data.

Mila Fair, a sophomore journalism major and a reporter for the campus TV station, said students tell her they’re afraid to join protests, in part because of LSU’s new anti-DEI rules and the national crackdown on student demonstrations. Those who do attend are often afraid to go on camera with her, she said.

Latin American studies professor Andrew Sluyter said administrators normally listen to the student government—even more than to the faculty government—but now worry about students getting the school into “political hot water.” He had his own run-in with the DEI ban: As part of a February effort to scrub school websites of diversity references, in which the university purged hundreds of webpages referencing DEI-related content, LSU deleted a 2022 press release announcing a prestigious fellowship he’d won that mentioned “higher education’s racial inequities.”

Students recognize the pressure LSU is under from the federal government, but they want administrators to stand up for them, said graduate student Alicia Cerquone, a student senator. “We want some sort of communication from the university that shows commitment to its community, that they have our backs and they’ll protect students,” she said.

The University of California, Berkeley

Since early April, Rayne Xue, a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, has watched with trepidation as the Trump administration has taken one step after another to limit international students’ access to American higher education.

First came the abrupt cancellation, then reinstatement, of visas for 23 Berkeley students and recent graduates. Then the government cut off Harvard’s ability to enroll international students—a move since blocked by a federal judge—raising fears that something similar could happen at Berkeley. And late last month, as this year’s graduates were celebrating their recent commencements, Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused interviews for all new student visas and announced that he would “aggressively revoke” those of Chinese students.

Xue, who is from Beijing and won a student senate seat this past spring on a platform of supporting international students, said the administration’s actions strike at a critical part of campus life at Berkeley.

“College is the opportunity of a lifetime to unlearn prejudices and embrace new perspectives, neither of which is possible without a student body that comes from a wide range of geographic and cultural backgrounds,” she said.

About 16 percent of UC Berkeley’s more than 45,000 students come from outside the United States to study at the crown jewel of California’s public research university system, where creeks run through campus beneath cooling redwoods and parking spaces are set aside for Nobel laureates. China, India, South Korea, and Canada send the biggest numbers. International students pay higher tuition than California residents, boosting the university’s coffers and subsidizing some of their peers. Many of them conduct cutting-edge research in fields like computer science, engineering, and chemistry.

Now the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, magnified by the yanking of billions in federal research dollars, has international students worried about their future on campus. Many are changing their behavior to avoid scrutiny: Some canceled travel plans and many said they avoid walking near any campus protests in fear of being photographed.

“It’s difficult for international students to feel secure when they cannot anticipate what the administration might charge against them next—or whether they might be unfairly targeted,” said one global studies major, who asked not to be identified for fear of attracting retaliation.

How secure international students feel depends in part on which country they’re from, some said.

Sitting outside Berkeley’s International House, a Spanish-style building with a commanding view of the San Francisco Bay that has housed foreign students alongside their US peers since 1930, Laura, a rising senior from Germany who asked me not to use her surname for fear of retaliation, said she felt comfortable traveling to Mexico with friends for spring break. “I feel like the German passport is pretty safe,” she said. But a friend from Pakistan opted to stay behind, she said, worried about being detained.

Tomba Morreau, a rising junior from the Netherlands studying sociology, said he stopped posting about politics on social media—just in case.

That kind of self-censorship troubles Paul Fine, cochair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, which represents about a fifth of the university’s tenure-track faculty.

Federal policies are “creating this culture of fear where people start to censor themselves and try to stay under the radar and not show up in their full selves, whether for academic work or activism,” he said.

International students in Fine’s classes told him they wanted to attend a recent protest against federal threats to higher education but were afraid of the consequences. Others told him they were skipping academic conferences outside the United States that they otherwise would have attended.

“Berkeley really prides ourselves on being an intellectual hub that convenes people from all over the world to work on the most important problems,” Fine said. Now that identity is at risk, especially as actual and threatened cuts to grants make it harder for faculty to hire international graduate students and postdocs.

Most poignant, he said, was hearing from demoralized Chinese students who left a repressive government to come to the United States only to see attacks on academic freedom replicated here.

Xue said she hopes the crisis facing universities would draw attention to the challenges international students face, including limited financial aid and the stereotype that all of them are wealthy. With her colleagues in student government, she is lobbying for Berkeley to spend more on the international office, which provides one-on-one advising on visa issues and employment.

For Lily Liu, a Chinese computer scientist, 2025 was shaping up to be a year of milestones. She graduated with a doctorate last month, has a job lined up at a leading artificial intelligence company and is engaged to be married in November.

But the Trump administration’s changing policies toward international scholars have complicated celebrations for Liu, who’s in a federal program that extends her visa for up to a year beyond graduation so she can gain work experience here. She canceled summer travel plans with her family, concerned that she might not be let back into the country. And she’s considering moving her wedding to the United States from China, even though many of her relatives wouldn’t be able to attend.

“For international students, every policy affects us a lot,” she said. So Liu is careful. After the publication of her thesis was delayed, she visited Berkeley’s international office to make sure the setback wouldn’t affect her work permit. Her fiancé has a green card, which should theoretically mean his immigration status is more stable. But these days, she said, who knows?

Growing up here, Reina Saldivar had always loved science—all she wanted to watch on TV was Animal Planet. But until she applied on a whim to a program for aspiring researchers after her first year at the University of Texas at San Antonio, she assumed she would spend her life as a lab technician, running cultures.

The program, Maximizing Access to Research Careers, or MARC, was started by the National Institutes of Health decades ago at colleges around the country to prepare students, especially those from historically underrepresented backgrounds, for livelihoods in the biomedical sciences.

Saldivar got in. And through the program, she spent much of her time on campus in a university lab, helping develop a carrier molecule for a new Lyme disease vaccine. Now Saldivar, who graduated this spring, plans to eventually return to academia for a doctorate.

“What MARC taught me was that my dreams aren’t out of reach,” she said.

Saldivar is among hundreds who’ve participated in the MARC program since its 1980 founding at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She may also be among the last. In April, the university’s MARC program director, Edwin Barea-Rodriguez, opened his e-mail inbox to find a form letter terminating the initiative and advising against recruiting more cohorts.

The letter cited “changes in NIH/HHS [Health and Human Services] priorities.” In recent months, the Trump administration has canceled at least half a dozen programs meant to train scholars and diversify the sciences as part of an effort to root out what the president labels illegal DEI.

In a statement to The Hechinger Report, the NIH said that it “is committed to restoring the agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science” and is reviewing grants to make sure the agency is “addressing the United States chronic disease epidemic.”

With MARC ending, Barea-Rodriguez is searching for a way to continue supporting current participants until they graduate in the next academic year. Without access to federal money, however, the young scientists are anxious about their futures—and that of public health in general.

“It took years to be where we are now,” said Barea-Rodriguez, who said he was not speaking on behalf of his university, “and in a hundred days everything was destroyed.”

UTSA’s sprawling campus sits on the northwest edge of San Antonio, far from tourist sites like the Alamo and the River Walk. Forty-four percent of the nearly 31,000 undergraduate students are the first in their families to attend college; more than 61 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino. The university was one of the first nationwide to earn Department of Education recognition as a Hispanic-serving institution, a designation for colleges where at least a quarter of full-time undergraduates are Hispanic.

When Barea-Rodriguez arrived to teach at the school in 1995, many locals considered it a glorified community college, he said. But in the three decades since, the investments NIH made through MARC and other federal programs have helped it become a top-tier research university. That provided students like Saldivar with access to world-class opportunities close to home and fostered talent that propelled the economy in San Antonio and beyond.

The Trump administration has quickly upended much of that infrastructure, not only by terminating career pipeline programs for scholars but also by pulling more than $8.2 million in National Science Foundation money from UTSA.

One of those canceled grants paid for student researchers and the development of new technologies to improve equity in math education and better serve elementary school kids from underrepresented backgrounds in a city that is about 64 percent Hispanic. Another aimed to provide science, technology, engineering, and math programming to bilingual and low-income communities.

UTSA administrators did not respond to requests for comment about how federal funding freezes and cuts are affecting the university. Nationwide, more than 1,600 NSF grants have been axed since January.

In San Antonio, undergraduates said MARC and other now-dead programs helped prepare them for academic and professional careers that might have otherwise been elusive. Speaking in a lab remodeled and furnished with NIH money, where leftover notes and diagrams on glass erase boards showed the research questions students had been noodling, they described how the programs taught them about drafting an abstract, honing public speaking and writing skills, networking, putting together a résumé, and applying for summer research positions, travel scholarships, and graduate opportunities.

“All of the achievements that I’ve collected have pretty much been, like, a direct result of the program,” said Seth Fremin, a senior biochemistry major who transferred to UTSA from community college and has coauthored five articles in major journals, with more in the pipeline. After graduation, he will start a fully funded doctoral program at the University of Pittsburgh to continue his research on better understanding chemical reactions.

Similarly, Elizabeth Negron, a senior, is spending this summer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researching skin microbiomes to see if certain bacteria predispose some people to cancers.

“It’s weird when you meet students who didn’t get into these programs,” Negron said, referring to MARC. “They haven’t gone to conferences. They haven’t done research. They haven’t been able to mentor students.… It’s very strange to acknowledge what life would have been without it. I don’t know if I could say I’d be as successful as I am now.”

With money for MARC erased, Negron said she will probably need a job once she returns to campus in the fall so she can afford day-to-day expenses. Before, research was her job.

“Without MARC,” she said, “it becomes a question of can I at least cover my tuition and my very basic needs.”

The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign

Champaign—When Peter Goldsmith received notice in late January that his Soybean Innovation Lab at the University of Illinois would soon lose all of its funding, he had no idea it was coming. Suddenly Goldsmith, the lab’s director, had to tell his 30 employees they would soon be out of a job and tell research partners across Africa that operations would come to a halt. The lab didn’t even have money to water its soybean fields in Africa.

One employee, Julia Paniago, was in Malawi when she got the news. “We came back the next day,” she said of her team, “and it was a lot of uncertainty. And a lot of people cried.”

The University of Illinois’s Soybean Innovation Lab (SIL) was part of a network of 17 labs at universities across the country, all working on research related to food production and reducing global hunger, and all funded through the US Agency for International Development—until the Trump administration shut down USAID.

Soybeans—which provide both oil and high-protein food—aren’t yet commonly grown in Malawi. SIL researchers have been working toward two related goals: helping local farmers increase soybean production and ameliorate malnutrition and generating enough interest in the crop there that a new export market will open for American farmers.

The lab’s researchers work in soybean breeding, economics, and mechanical research as well as education. They hope to show that soybean production in Africa is worth further investment so that eventually the private sector will come in after them.

“The people who work at SIL, they like being right at the frontier of change,” Goldsmith said. “It’s high-risk work—that’s what the universities do. That’s what scientific research is about.”

UI, the state’s flagship with a sprawling campus spread between the cities of Urbana and Champaign, is noted for its research work, especially agricultural research.

Labs and researchers across the university lost funding in cuts made by the Trump administration; more than $25 million from agencies including NIH, NSF and the National Endowment for the Humanities was cut, Melissa Edwards, associate vice chancellor for research and innovation, said, a total of 59 grants amounting to 3.6 percent of their overall federal grant portfolio.

Annette Donnelly, who just received her doctorate in education, is among those affected. Her research focuses on educating malnourished children in Africa and developing courses to help Africans learn how to process soybeans into oil.

In April, SIL was handed a lifeline—an anonymous $1 million gift that will keep the lab running through April 2026. The donation wasn’t enough for Goldsmith to rehire all of his employees; SIL’s annual operating budget before the USAID cuts was $3.3 million (and would have kept things running through 2027). But, he said, the money will allow SIL to continue its research in the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi, a project he hopes will attract future donors to fund the lab’s work.

The April donation saved Donnelly’s job, but her priorities shifted. “We’re doing research,” she said, “but we’re also doing a lot of proposal writing. It has taken on a much greater priority.”

Donnelly hopes to attract more funding so she can resume research she had started in western Kenya, demonstrating that introducing soy into children’s diets increased their protein intake by up to 65 percent, she said.

The impact that funding cuts will have on researchers at the soybean lab pales in comparison to the impact on their partners in Africa, Donnelly emphasized. There, she said, the cuts mean processors will likely slow production, limiting their ability to deliver soy products. “The consequences there are much bigger,” she said.

The Soybean Innovation Lab was funded through the Feed the Future initiative, a program to help partner countries develop better agricultural practices that began under the Obama administration in 2010. All 17 Feed the Future innovation labs funded through USAID lost funding, except for the one at Kansas State University, which studies heat-tolerant wheat.

The soybean lab’s office is housed on a quiet edge of the Illinois campus in a building once occupied by the university’s veterinary medicine program. Across the street, rows of greenhouses are home to the Crop Science Department’s experiments.

There, Brian Diers is breeding soybean varieties that resist soybean rust, a disease that’s been an obstacle to ramping up soybean production across sub-Saharan Africa. A professor emeritus who is retired, Diers works part-time at SIL to assist with soybean breeding. The April donation wasn’t enough to cover his work. Now he volunteers his time.

“ If we can help African agriculture take off and become more productive, that’s eventually going to help their economies and then provide more opportunities for American farmers to export to Africa,” he said.

Goldsmith drew an analogy between his lab’s work and the state of American agriculture in the 1930s. As the Dust Bowl swept through the Great Plains, Monsanto or another company could have stepped in to help combat it, but didn’t. Public land-grant universities did.

“That’s where the innovation comes from, from the public land grants in the US,” Goldsmith said. “And now the public land grants still work in US agriculture but also in the developing world.”

Commercial soybean producers hesitate to dip their toes into unproven markets, he said, so it’s SIL’s job to demonstrate that a viable market exists. “That was our secret sauce, in that lots of commercial players liked the products, the technologies we had, and wanted to move into the soybean space, but it wasn’t a profitable market,” Goldsmith said of the African soybean market.

Diers said federal funding cuts imperil not just the development of commerce and global food production but the next generation of scientists as well. “We could potentially lose a generation of scientists who won’t go into science because there’s no funding right now.”

6 days ago Share Save Paul Melly Africa analyst Share Save

AFP/Getty Images The focus of US military strategy in Africa is changing under Trump

With US President Donald Trump on a cost-cutting warpath since starting his second term, aid to Africa has been slashed and now defence spending is in his sights - but could these approaches cost more in the long run? The phrase his administration presses on Europe to assume more of the costs of its own defence is ""burden sharing"". This is the challenge that Washington is now throwing down to African armies too - and they are far less comfortably resourced to take it on. Moreover, having paid dearly in lives and money, in the struggle to hold back the spreading reach of jihadist armed groups across the Sahel, the Lake Chad basin and Somalia over recent years, they could be forgiven for feeling that they already carry much of the burden - and for the sake not just of their own continent but the wider international community too. Benin, which has lost more than 80 soldiers in jihadist attacks since the start of the year, is just one example.

""The epicentre of terrorism on the globe"" is how the Sahel was described a few days ago by Gen Michael Langley, who as head of US Africa Command (Africom) oversees the American military presence south of the Sahara. In briefings and interviews over the past few weeks, he has graphically outlined the threat that jihadist groups will present if their push southward towards the Gulf of Guinea succeeds. ""One of the terrorists' new objectives is gaining access to West African coasts. If they secure access to the coastline, they can finance their operations through smuggling, human trafficking and arms trading. This not only puts African nations at risk but also raises the chance of threats reaching US shores."" Gen Langley has admitted that the current upsurge in militant attacks is ""deeply concerning"". Yet he has also repeatedly hammered home a core message: the US is minded to rein back its own sub-Saharan military operations, leaving local armies to take on more of the defence burden. Some 6,500 personnel are currently deployed in Africa by the US military and a 2019 list published by Africom mentioned 13 ""enduring"" American bases across the continent and a further 17 more temporary facilities. But some of these installations, including the purpose-built drone base at Agadez in Niger, have already been shut down, in particular after military juntas seized power in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso since 2020. And it now looks as if the once-ambitious American operational footprint will be pruned back quite a lot more. Perhaps we will see more air power deployed from offshore to hit militant targets - Gen Langley says there have been 25 strikes in Somalia this year, double the 2024 total - but a much thinner permanent on-the-ground military presence. ""Some things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,"" he recently told a conference in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, that brought together chiefs of defence staff and other senior officers from 37 countries. ""Our aim is not to serve as a permanent crutch, but to achieve US security objectives that overlap with our partners. We should be able to help African nations build the self-reliance they need to independently confront terrorism and insurgencies."" In the bluntness of his language Gen Langley reflects the stark change of outlook and policy that has come from January's change of power at the White House. ""We have set our priorities now - protecting the homeland."" What matters to the no-longer-so-new Trump II administration, the general made clear in a Pentagon publication last week, is fighting terrorists - particularly those who might attack the US. Other priorities are countering the spread of Chinese military influence across Africa and protecting freedom of maritime navigation through key trade choke points such as the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal and the Bab el-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea.

In some respects, the focus on training and capacity building that Gen Langley now expounds is not so very different from the approach of previous American administrations, Republican as well as Democrat. He lauds the National Guard State Partnership Program, through which individual US states have been helping to build the capacity of government security forces across Africa and other parts of the world - for the past three decades. France too is pursuing this approach, with the closure of bases in Chad and Senegal, while those in Ivory Coast and Gabon have been handed over to their governments, with only small French training teams left behind to work alongside African colleagues. However, in other respects, the Trump administration's Africa strategy represents a drastic shrinkage in outlook and - critics might argue - a conscious retreat from addressing the factors that drive instability, conflict and terrorism, particularly in the Sahel, which is among the poorest regions on the planet. For under President Joe Biden the US looked far beyond the military realm alone in its efforts to counter the both the growing reach of jihadist groups and other sources of violence. And Gen Langley, as Africom chief, was an articulate exponent of this much broader thinking. Only last year, in an interview with the Associated Press news agency, he outlined what he described as a ""whole of government"" response to the proliferation of conflict, stressing the importance of good governance and action to tackle the fragilities of African states and the impacts of desertification, crop failure and environmental change. This approach openly recognised that recruitment by armed groups and the spread of violence is fuelled not only by jihadist ideology, but also by a host of social and economic factors, including the stresses now afflicting farming and pastoralist livelihoods. Gen Langley himself does not seem to have abandoned this analysis, recently noting how Ivory Coast had countered the jihadist threat to its northern border areas by complementing security force deployments with development projects. He could equally have pointed to the success of a similar approach pursued by the president of Niger, Mohamed Bazoum, before he was deposed in the July 2023 coup.

But of course, these days Africom must operate within the context of a US foreign policy radically reshaped under Trump. There are even rumours that it could be downgraded to become a subsidiary of the US command in Europe and Gen Langley suggests African governments should tell Washington what they thought of this idea. Already the separate Africa unit at the radically slimmed down National Security Council at the White House is reportedly being wound up and integrated into the Middle East-North Africa section. Its director, Gen Jami Shawley, an Africa specialist appointed to the role only in March, has now been assigned to more general strategic functions. Addressing Congress this week, Gen Langley warned about China's and Russia's African ambitions: Beijing's agility at capitalising on the US's absence and Moscow's ability to seize military opportunities created by chaos and instability. Given these concerns, some might wonder if the general is discreetly signally his doubts about a slimmed down Africa strategy. Meanwhile, under the ""efficiency drive"" led, until recently, by tech billionaire Elon Musk, the American government's main international development agencies, USAID and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, have been effectively shut down. The spine of the new US economic engagement with Africa is now private sector trade and investment. But business generally needs to operate in a stable and secure context - which Africa's most fragile and violence-prone regions cannot offer. And in winding up the American development agencies, the Trump administration has stepped aside from funding the rural projects and social programmes that sought to address land and water pressures and lack of economic opportunity, the key drivers of conflict - and the jihadist groups' recruitment of frustrated rural young people. For the fragile regions that are the main sources of jihadist violence the US response is reduced to the purely military, and now it is seeking to shift even most of that on to the shoulders of African states that already struggle to respond adequately to a plethora of challenges and responsibilities.

Abdul-Rahman Edward Koroma was supposed to be in New York last week.

For months, the disability rights activist from Sierra Leone had been looking forward to his trip to the United Nations session. He had a busy schedule of meetings and official events talking about the challenges of living with a disability in his country, including showcasing a documentary about how the disability community is especially vulnerable to flooding and landslides associated with climate change.

But on June 5, he learned he couldn't come. Sierra Leone was one of 19 countries where President Trump had banned or restricted the ability to travel to the U.S.

""Honestly, for me, it's quite painful, and it's quite disappointing,"" says Koroma. ""I hope the U.S. government will reconsider. The world is a global village, we all need each other, one way or the other.""

toggle caption Abdul-Rahman Edward Koroma

Why is Sierra Leone on the list? The Trump administration cites high levels of visitors to the U.S. who've overstayed their visa as the reason. Other countries were selected for national security reasons.

""We will restore the travel ban, some people call it the Trump travel ban, and keep the radical Islamic terrorists out of our country that was upheld by the Supreme Court,"" President Trump said in a statement .

The administration banned travelers from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Travelers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela also face some restrictions.

More bans may be coming. A State Department memo first reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by NPR suggests the administration may add 36 more countries, largely in Africa, to the banned or restricted list.

Consequences of the ban

Stories like Koroma's will likely accumulate over the coming weeks and months, as global health researchers, workers and advocates from these countries are barred from coming to the U.S. to learn — and to share their expertise. Some global health specialists say the restrictions will ultimately harm U.S. interests by reducing our engagement with the world.

""We are closing ourselves off from the active participation of potential allies,"" says Judd Walson , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. ""That will only lead to negative consequences in the long term.""

Closing the U.S. off could ultimately open it up more to global health threats, says Walson.

The ban follows the administration's cancellation of foreign aid and withdrawal of U.S. membership from the World Health Organization. Walson says these decisions are upending many of the institutions designed to detect and respond to disease threats worldwide.

""As we think about the new architecture of global health and how it can respond to the many crises that emerge around the world, participation from all these countries is critical,"" says Walson, and ultimately benefits Americans.

He notes that new infectious disease threats could emerge from any of the banned countries.

""Our inability to engage with partners from those places, who can serve as eyes and ears on the ground to identify threats. just hampers our ability to have a coordinated response,""

Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University, is concerned future bans could hamper his team's research on Marburg, a hemorrhagic fever virus. It's normally found in bats, but can spillover into humans, sparking deadly outbreaks.

Karan and his team are trying to understand those spillover dynamics, in part by studying antibodies in people who live near past outbreaks along the Uganda-Kenya border.

""Part of the testing we'd do involves a test where there's expertise in Uganda, at the Ugandan Viral Research Institute,"" says Karan.

Uganda is among the 36 countries under consideration for future restrictions. If that happens, Karan worries his team may have restricted access to that expertise. While such restrictions wouldn't preclude collaboration via Zoom, Karan says it's just not the same as in-person.

""Many of the best conversations and ideas that we had happened during our drives, during meals or unplanned moments,"" he says of interactions with foreign researchers in person. ""Implementing these kinds of bans has a huge effect on research studies and really impedes progress.""

Sponsor Message

Scientific conferences often serve as the nexus for that kind of collaboration, where researchers gather to share research and connect with colleagues. Trump's travel restrictions are already preventing some scientists from being able to travel to the U.S. for conferences.

""We need to have such participation and contact, but it's now very difficult,"" said a biomedical scientist from Yemen who requested anonymity because speaking out could draw negative attention that would cause her university to retaliate. The scientist was planning to travel to California this fall for a conference on cancer management but cannot because of the ban, noting:. ""Such an absolute restriction for all people is not wise.""

The U.S. could also lose its global role as a key location for trainings and scientific conferences. The travel bans, coupled with broader tensions around immigration in the U.S., have already led organizers of these events to look elsewhere.

""Our research team decided to host a planning meeting in London as opposed to the U.S. due to concerns with visas and the overall climate,"" says Walson. There are economic consequences if U.S. conferences are canceled, he says. And with a likely reduced U.S. presence at conferences held elsewhere, there could be more intangible impacts too.

""Diseases don't respect borders, and infections travel faster than diplomacy,"" says Walson. ""Whether we want to or not, we have to understand the reality of the global community as it is today. If we don't engage, we will suffer the consequences."""

This extraordinary philanthropic pledge is expected to fulfil a commitment he made on May 8 to donate “virtually all” of his wealth before the Gates Foundation permanently closes on December 31, 2045.

Former Mozambique first lady Graca Machel, a renowned humanitarian and global advocate for women’s and children’s rights, attended the event and welcomed the announcement. Describing the continent’s current situation as at a “moment of crisis”, she declared: “We are counting on Mr Gates’s steadfast commitment to continue walking this path of transformation alongside us.”

The Gates Foundation has operated in Africa for more than two decades, primarily in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. Over the years, it has funded a range of programmes in areas such as nutrition, healthcare, agriculture, water and sanitation, gender equality and financial inclusion. In agriculture alone, it has spent about $6bn on development initiatives. Despite this substantial investment, the foundation’s efforts have been the subject of widespread criticism both in Africa and internationally.

In particular, serious concerns have been raised about the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the foundation’s agricultural interventions – especially the Green Revolution model it has promoted through AGRA, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. Co-founded in 2006 by the Rockefeller and Gates foundations, AGRA aimed to improve food security and reduce poverty for 30 million smallholder households in 11 sub-Saharan African countries by 2021. Nineteen years on, the agricultural transformation Gates envisioned – driven by American capital and know-how – has failed to materialise.

Experts argue that the Green Revolution model has not only fallen short on alleviating hunger and poverty but may in fact also be exacerbating both. Problems commonly cited include rising farmer debt, increased pesticide use, environmental degradation, declining crop diversity and a growing corporate stranglehold over Africa’s food systems.

The limitations of Gates’s agricultural ambitions are, arguably, unsurprising. The model is rooted in the American Green Revolution of the 1940s and 1950s – a technological shift linked to settler-colonial agricultural systems and racialised power structures. Gates’s philanthropic ideology, shaped by this legacy, risks reproducing systems of dependency and ownership in the Global South.

At the core of the Green Revolution, past and present, is a belief in the supremacy of Western science and innovation. This worldview justifies the transfer of proprietary technologies to developing countries while simultaneously devaluing local knowledge systems and Indigenous expertise.

Despite its rhetorical commitment to equity, the Gates Foundation often prioritises and financially benefits researchers, pharmaceutical firms and agritech corporations in the West far more than the smallholder farmers and local specialists it claims to serve. Kenyan agroecologist Celestine Otieno has described this model as “food slavery” and a “second phase of colonisation”.

Meanwhile, the foundation’s global health programmes have also drawn criticism for promoting technical, apolitical solutions that ignore the deeply rooted historical and political determinants of health inequity. Just as troubling is the fact that many of these interventions are implemented in poor communities with minimal transparency or local accountability.

As Gwilym David Blunt, a political philosopher and lecturer in international politics, notes, transnational philanthropy – exemplified by the Gates Foundation – grants the ultra-wealthy disproportionate power over public priorities. This undermines the principle of autonomy that undergirds any vision of distributive global justice, including the right of Africans to shape their own futures.

All of the African countries working with the Gates Foundation continue to face the enduring problems associated with foreign-designed economic interventions and chronic dependence on aid. South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria, for instance, are all contending with the fallout from United States President Donald Trump’s cuts to the US Agency for International Development.

Still, Gates’s philanthropy is only one piece of a much larger, more entrenched problem.

No amount of aid can compensate for the absence of visionary, ethical and accountable leadership – or the political instability that plagues parts of the continent. In this vacuum, figures like Gates step in. But these interventions can be politically expedient and risk concealing deeper systemic dysfunction.

On June 1, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed awarded Gates the Grand Order of Merit of Ethiopia in recognition of the foundation’s 25 years of contributions to the country. Yet even Gates would likely acknowledge that Ethiopia remains mired in corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency and persistent mismanagement of public funds.

Abiy’s nationalist rhetoric and disastrous internal policies helped trigger a 2020–2022 civil war, which claimed the lives of up to 600,000 people. Although the conflict formally ended in November 2022, Amnesty International has reported that millions still await justice. Human rights violations remain widespread with little accountability for atrocities committed in Tigray and Oromia.

Despite overwhelming evidence, Abiy continues to deny any wrongdoing by his military, insisting in parliament that his forces have not committed war crimes. Such claims only underscore the deep crisis of leadership Ethiopia faces.

What Ethiopia – and many other African states – urgently need is not another influx of Western money but a radical overhaul of governance. Indeed, Gates’s contributions may paradoxically help prop up the very systems of impunity and dysfunction that block meaningful progress.

This is why Machel’s response to Gates’s announcement was so disappointing. Rather than celebrating the promise of more Western aid, she could have used the moment to speak frankly about Africa’s deeper crisis: corrupt, extractive and unaccountable leadership. Her suggestion that Africans should rely indefinitely on foreign benevolence is not only misguided – it also reinforces the very power dynamics that philanthropy claims to disrupt.

Yes, Gates’s decision to donate most of his fortune to Africa is, of course, admirable. But as an outsider immersed in the logic of “white saviourism” and “philanthrocapitalism”, he cannot fix a continent’s self-inflicted wounds. No foreign billionaire can.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

""Our members are surviving with grace,"" says Justine Adhiambo Obura, the chairperson of No Sex for Fish.

She's talking about a cooperative of 20 women who did the unthinkable. They are fishmongers from the village of Nduru Beach in Kenya who said no to fishermen who demanded: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

With the support of various charities and programs, these women eventually got their own boats — and hired men to fish for them in Lake Victoria. The name of their group is a testament to their success.

But in the year 2025, their survival is precarious. The No Sex for Fish women are coping with the legacy of disastrous floods that have virtually destroyed their village and disrupted the fishing business. And now they're facing new fears about their health.

Eleven of these women are HIV positive. Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S.

But in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted.

A single mom's story

Rebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place.

Their former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees.

While scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries.

She says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be ""the displacement from my home"" because of the flooding — and earning a living.

Now she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy?

""They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,"" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother.

""We are scared of what the future holds,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

So what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid.

But according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them.

It's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity ""to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.""

The source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and ""took a while to restart.""

What's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback.

""The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,"" the source says.

The government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit.

So even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs.

""People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,"" the former PEPFAR employee said. ""But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.""

""There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,"" says Oluoch. ""They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.""

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

In response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that ""PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries.

""All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.""

Erick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government.

""I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,"" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024.

Haunted by a member's death

The women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills.

Rose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Her husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS.

Jack is HIV positive as well. ""I have also been taking my drugs from health center,"" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad.

""I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,"" he says.

Naomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs.

Like most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods.

Adding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, ""My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,"" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills.

""It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,"" she says.

Akoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive.

It is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband.

Theresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. ""The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,"" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties.

And it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. ""Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,"" she says. ""The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.""

Cash aid from table banking

Justine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other.

""We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

""Table banking"" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs.

They meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income.

Alice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need.

But she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. ""The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,"" says Amonde.

In spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors.

Yet it can be hard to hold on to hope.

""We are living a daily nightmare,"" says Rebbeccah Atieno. ""Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.""

Heavy rain that began falling early on Thursday submerged the town of Mokwa, a major trading and transportation hub west of Abuja, where traders buy beans, onions and other food.

The deluge washed away sections of roads and bridges and left some buildings almost entirely underwater.

On Friday, the death count rapidly soared from 21 to more than 100.

As search efforts continued on Saturday, the number climbed again to 151, spokesperson for Niger State emergency service Ibrahim Audu Husseini said.

And it inflicted further misery still, injuring at least 11 and displacing more than 3,000 people, while some are still unaccounted for.

Mohamed Adow, director of Kenya-based thinktank Power Shift Africa, called it a ""cruel irony"" that parts of Africa can be ""baked dry and then suffer from floods that destroy lives and livelihoods"".

He told Sky News: ""The terrible floods in Nigeria are another reminder that Africa stands on the front line of the climate crisis.""

Polluting countries must ""urgently"" slash fossil fuel emissions that drive climate change and target climate funding at those who need it most, Mr Adow added.

Residents have been picking their way through the wreckage and lamenting the loss of lives and livelihoods.

Kazeem Muhammed said: ""We lost many lives, and the properties, our farm produce. Those that have their storage, have lost it.""

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said he has directed the activation of the national emergency response centre to assist the state quickly.

""Search-and-rescue operations are ongoing, and all relevant federal agencies have been mobilised to support the state government's efforts,"" President Tinubu said in a late night message.

""Relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay. We will ensure that no Nigerian affected by this disaster is left behind or unheard of.""

In February, the UK government announced a cut to the aid budget from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income from 2027, to pay for increased defence spending. It followed other cuts by the previous government, and NGOs warn countries, including Nigeria, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe, will be hit hardest.

Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy at Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said: ""The cuts to UK aid, alongside reductions in humanitarian and development funding by countries around the world, undermine our capacity to support countries like Nigeria - those that have contributed the least to the climate crisis but are suffering its worst impacts.""

""We urgently need an impact assessment of the UK aid cuts.""

A UK government spokesperson said it ""remains fully committed to making the world a safer and more prosperous place which is why the prime minister has announced that defence spending will rise to 2.5% by 2027 - the largest rise since the Cold War"".

""We will continue to play a key humanitarian role globally, including on tackling climate change,"" the spokesperson added.

What causes Nigeria's flooding?

Flooding is common in Nigeria in the rainy season, which began in April.

On Friday, local officials said poor infrastructure had exacerbated the recent damage, appealing for ""long overdue"" construction of waterways in the area to begin.

But climate change adds an extra layer of danger.

That's because hotter air can hold more moisture, so when it rains, it rains harder.

U.S. Africa Command, which does everything from helping the Somalian military target strikes on al-Shabaab to sending Army civil affairs soldiers to build schools in Cameroon, is working out what their new role on the continent will look like as the U.S. halts aid that was meant to stabilize those countries and make it easier for them to defend themselves, Defense One’s Meghann Myers reported Thursday.

“Some things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,” AFRICOM commander Marine Gen. Michael Langley, speaking from the 2025 African Chiefs of Defense Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, told reporters Thursday. “So we're asking you to step up and burden-share with us.”

Langley called the African Sahel region “the epicenter of terrorism on the globe.” The region includes Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. “It is the flash point of prolonged conflict and growing instability,” he said.

And around the Horn of Africa, which is the stomping ground for al-Shabaab terrorists around Mogadishu, “They're making assumptions that there's going to be gaps in aid in certain regions across Somalia, and there's shadow governments,” Langley said. “They're trying to exploit that scene.”

In the meantime, China can and has stepped in to provide aid to Africa and otherwise fill gaps left by the U.S., though their influence model depends more on lending to African governments, Myers writes. Read the rest, here.

The Air Force Reserve is on track to lose nearly half of its fighter jets by the end of the decade, a course its top general warns could sideline the force in conflicts and deepen the military’s pilot crisis, Defense One’s Audrey Decker reported Thursday.

Background: The Air Force is retiring those and other aircraft to free up money for newer technology and modernization, but active-duty forces are prioritized over the part-time Reserve and National Guard components. And unlike the Guard, the Reserve lacks gubernatorial advocacy, making it more vulnerable.

Involved: The F-16 aggressor squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, is to shut down this year. The F-16 unit at Homestead Air Reserve Base, Florida, and the A-10 units at Davis-Monthan, Whiteman, and Moody Air Force Base are slated to close in the following years, Lt. Gen. John Healy, chief of the Air Force Reserve, said during an interview at the Pentagon.

Also notable: Over the past two years, 200 pilots left active duty without moving to the Reserve because of a lack of modern aircraft, the general recently told Congress. As of now, only one Reserve fighter squadron is set to receive new aircraft: the 301st Fighter Wing in Fort Worth, Texas. That unit received its first four F-35s in November, and is slated to have all 26 jets by 2027. Continue reading, here.

The Army is set to meet its recruiting goal early and could go beyond it this year thanks in part to 14,000 who signed up last year, Military-dot-com reported Thursday.

Topline read: “As of Monday, the Army had brought in 59,875 new active-duty enlisted soldiers with a total goal of 61,000 for fiscal 2025, which ends Sept. 30,” reporter Steve Beynon writes. The 2024 batch had “delayed shipping to basic training due to school obligations or training capacity issues,” he explained.

Now officials are talking about how to absorb the excess. “With the Army expected to hit its target in the next week or two, the Pentagon is weighing whether to invoke a little-used and relatively obscure authority that allows the defense secretary to increase a service's end strength by up to 3% without congressional action,” Beynon reports. “The other option, a 4% increase, would require approval from Capitol Hill.” Continue reading, here.

Commentary: “The U.S. Army is too light to win,” Dr. Richard D. Hooker, Jr. is a Senior Fellow with The Atlantic Council and a Senior Associate with the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center, writes for Defense One.

His advice: Re-equip light brigades with protected, wheeled transport mounting heavy weapons; restore their antiarmor companies; increase the density of Javelin anti-tank and Stinger air defense systems across light formations; replace towed light artillery with wheeled, 155mm systems like the French Caesar or German RCH-155; reverse the deactivation of divisional air cavalry squadrons; and arm divisional UH-60 assault helos with the Hellfire antitank missile system.

Update: Sub-maker General Dynamics' Electric Boat agreed to a 30% wage increase following talks this week with the United Auto Workers, Reuters reported Wednesday. “The ratification comes over a month after members authorized a strike, demanding cost-of-living adjustments to keep up with inflation,” the wire service writes.

IVAS, resurrected? Palmer Luckey of defense contractor Anduril is working with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg again, this time on a contract to build new headsets for the U.S. Army, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.

TLDR: “Meta and Anduril have jointly bid on an Army contract for VR hardware devices, worth up to about $100 million,” the Journal’s Heather Somerville writes. “The contract is intended to vet headset prototypes that are part of a larger $22 billion Army wearables project, of which Anduril became the lead vendor in February after Microsoft failed to deliver a functional VR headset.

And if the Army doesn’t want it? “Anduril said the collaboration on the headsets…is going forward irrespective of winning the Army contract. Anduril is betting other parts of the military will also be buyers,” the Journal reports.

Trump 2.0

The State Department is moving forward with a plan to eliminate or consolidate more than 300 of its offices and bureaus, including various national security offices, as well as units that cover Asia and the Middle East, Eric Katz and David Dimolfetta reported Thursday for Government Executive.

The plans could lead to a reduction of more than 3,400 employees and 45% of its structural entities, according to documents provided to lawmakers and employees on Thursday.

Why it matters: The plans presented Thursday offer more detail than those first laid out by State Secretary Marco Rubio in April, though the number of employee reductions was first reported by GovExec earlier this month. For details on which divisions will see reductions, go here.

Coming soon: Federal job applicants will soon be quizzed on their favorite Trump administration policy as part of the hiring process, according to the Office of Personnel Management’s new “merit hiring plan,” Erich Wagner of GovExec reported Thursday.

Background: The plan is a hodgepodge of bipartisan reforms developed under both Trump and former President Biden to accelerate and improve the hiring process, alongside plans to eradicate longstanding efforts to make the federal workforce more reflective of the American populace.

OPM said it will expand its recruiting efforts particularly at religious colleges and universities, homeschooling and other faith-based groups, an apparently conservative spin on the Biden administration’s efforts to step up recruitment at historically black colleges and universities.

The questionnaire also queries job applicants on their patriotism, “commitment to the Constitution” and the country’s “founding principles.” Said one federal human resources official: “Everything in it will make it more difficult to hire, not less. How the f--- do you define if someone is patriotic?” More, here.

It has proved catchy, intuitive, and politically convenient—especially now, as international development institutions face funding cuts and closures.

Few phrases have exerted as much staying power—or done as much damage to development policy—as the tidy little mantra: “trade, not aid.” For decades, this slogan has captivated ideologues across the political spectrum, offering a deceptively simple prescription for growth. It has proved catchy, intuitive, and politically convenient—especially now, as international development institutions face funding cuts and closures.

But it has always been more seductive than sound.

With the U.S.-led reordering of global trade, the slogan now rings more hollow than ever. As rich countries turn inward, slashing foreign assistance in favor of defense and domestic priorities, some are wondering: What happens next? Many see an opportunity—if not an imperative—to rethink a vital but flawed international aid system.

At this arguably existential moment for global trade and development, it’s time to retire “trade, not aid” for good—not simply because it misdiagnoses the problem of underdevelopment, but because it distorts policymaking. Both aid and trade can contribute to development. But neither works when treated as a panacea.

As the world grapples with a seismic shift in U.S. trade policy, and as we bid the slogan good riddance, it’s worth tracing the illusions it spun—and the policy damage it enabled.

The phrase dates back to the early 1950s, apparently coined by American industrialist H.W. Prentis Jr. as a call to end postwar assistance to Europe. It resurfaced at the inaugural United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1964, where developing countries—backed by Argentine economist Raúl Prebisch—demanded a fairer global economic order. Prebisch argued that countries on the developing periphery faced structural disadvantages requiring preferential access to rich-country markets. At the same time, he presciently observed that “no fundamental solution can be expected from trade with the United States,” advocating internal reforms and South-South cooperation instead.

That nuance quickly vanished. In the following decades, policymakers reduced Prebisch’s ideas to import substitution industrialization—a strategy that encouraged domestic manufacturing behind protective tariffs. When that strategy faltered, in the wake of the 1970s oil shocks and the ensuing Latin American debt crisis, many saw its demise as proof that markets—not the state—should drive development. By the late 1980s, the Washington Consensus had enshrined trade liberalization as orthodoxy, elevating “trade, not aid” from bumper-sticker rhetoric to a central plank of U.S. foreign policy.

That logic underpinned much of the post-Cold War agenda. In 1993, President Bill Clinton declared that “trade pacts are more important than missiles.” President George W. Bush followed suit, saying in 2001, “The first place to start on the economic front is to make sure we have free and fair trade with the African continent.”

At the turn of the century, that vision materialized in the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The AGOA gave eligible African countries duty-free access to U.S. markets for select goods while conditioning access on a shifting list of political and economic reforms. It was trade, not aid, as strategic engagement.

Yet the AGOA failed to significantly boost exports or spark broad-based growth. While some countries and sectors—especially textiles—benefited initially, others saw negligible gains. Underutilization may have played a role, but deeper analysis points to the structural limits of trade preferences. Basic commodities account for much of the export growth among eligible countries, while the preferences themselves often discouraged value addition or diversification beyond simple textiles. Even the early gains stalled amid rising competition from Asia, and the promise of long-term partnership wore thin.

Consider Lesotho, one of the biggest apparel exporters under the AGOA, which sends about 70 percent of its textiles to the United States. On April 2, it gained newfound notoriety when Washington hit it with a 50 percent tariff—the highest in the world—due to its trade surplus with the United States. A 90-day tariff pause offered temporary relief, but uncertainty lingers. So does the lesson: Trade preferences are only as dependable as the politics behind them.

In today’s environment of geopolitical fragmentation and supply chain fragility, the core promise of “trade, not aid”—that market access offers a singular path to prosperity—has unraveled. As the AGOA nears expiration in September, so too does the illusion it once upheld. Some African officials have warned that job losses and economic hardship could compound the effects of aid cuts should the agreement expire. Others, such as Kenyan Trade Minister Lee Kinyanjui, have remained upbeat, pointing to a competitive edge in textiles given the country’s 10 percent baseline tariff rate compared with harder-hit Asian rivals. In truth, the tariffs are a wake-up call: If the AGOA’s demise prompts policymakers to rethink trade’s limits, it may serve a valuable—if unintended—purpose.

Aid, too, carries a checkered legacy. Misaligned incentives, bureaucratic overreach, and a tendency to sideline local politics have often undermined its effectiveness. Anthropologist James Ferguson brought Lesotho to the fore in the 1990s in The Anti-Politics Machine, a landmark critique of how aid agencies glossed over political realities in favor of technocratic fixes. They cast Lesotho as an isolated, traditional society ripe for agricultural interventions—ignoring entrenched patronage networks and an economy long shaped by labor migration and remittances. The result wasn’t transformation but failure wrapped in expertise.

Such critiques remind today’s development practitioners about the risk of top-down approaches. While they need not abandon their aspirations, an ethical approach demands learning from the failures and false promises of aid.

It’s true that aid alone cannot make poor countries rich. But trade liberalization has done no better—and arguably faced less scrutiny. In the 1990s and early 2000s, economists championed open markets as necessary and sufficient for growth. The so-called East Asian miracle—a wave of rapid, export-led growth in eight East Asian countries—seemed to validate this logic. Yet many countries that embraced liberalization saw little transformation. When growth did occur, a narrow elite benefited.

To this day, “trade, not aid” remains one of development’s most persistent—and empty—slogans. Repeated by an ideologically diverse range of leaders and thinkers, including California Democrats and African heads of state, the slogan unsurprisingly surged in response to the latest foreign-aid cuts. Indeed, the opportunity that some see in foreign-aid cuts has long hinged on the idea that aid devilishly engenders dependency while trade virtuously empowers. But this rigidity—the reflexive embrace of trade as inherently positive and even an end in itself—helped fuel the current backlash against globalization.

The world needs to move beyond binaries. Aid and trade offer no silver bullets, but when paired effectively, they can reinforce each other.

Consider Costa Rica. Development cooperation enabled the creation of its top-ranked investment promotion agency—which, in turn, attracted major tech firms such as Intel and catalyzed an economic transformation. Elsewhere and more recently in Central America, cooperation with a solar service provider helped agribusinesses and companies such as Honduras’s DIELA—a growing supplier of electrical automotive parts for U.S. corporations such as General Motors—to dramatically reduce energy costs. Having cut its costs in half, DIELA now plans for a major expansion that will create jobs and bolster U.S. supply chains. Cooperation also helped streamline processes at a major seaport in Honduras, which cut shipping dispatch times in half and saved more than $15 million annually, including for U.S. exporters. Seeing these gains, reform-minded officials stepped up with investment aftercare services and a commitment to roll out the new system to all ports of entry—without foreign assistance.

These are not random acts of generosity or paternalistic gestures but a model of aid grounded in mutual interest and institutional strengthening. They also show how aid can lay the groundwork for trade by upgrading infrastructure, reducing friction, and improving regulatory systems.

The “Aid for Trade” initiative, run by the World Trade Organization (WTO), tried unsuccessfully to codify this idea, offering spin over substance. Economist Dani Rodrik, who tried to debunk “trade and aid” in 2005, has long cautioned that an overreliance on liberalization—a WTO hallmark—risks obscuring deeper structural problems, such as weak institutions and limited productive capabilities. Development success typically arises not from top-down aid, free trade, or rigid formulas but from experimentation, adaptation, and investments in domestic capabilities.

Today, the heyday of export-led industrialization is over. African and Latin American countries cannot hope to replicate the path of China or other manufacturing giants. Technology has made manufacturing more capital- and skill-intensive, limiting its potential to employ low-skilled workers. Services—especially digital and climate-related—are becoming more central to growth. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed global supply chain vulnerabilities. Climate change is reshaping demand and hitting commodity exporters hardest.

Policymakers should seize this industrial policy renaissance to reject stale binaries and pursue strategies that reflect today’s complexity. Rodrik and economist Joseph E. Stiglitz have proposed one such framework, rooted in the green transition and service-led growth. Developing nations should take heed and seek to bolster local innovation and regional integration, with less dependence on external demand for growth.

This opportunity serves U.S. national interests, too. Ensuring global stability, enhancing U.S. competitiveness, and countering authoritarian rivals all require more than abstract faith in markets. Development policy demands an “all of the above” approach: pragmatic, flexible, and collaborative.

That includes centering dignity and agency as practical decision-making principles, not abstract ideals. The historical failure to embody these principles has tarnished aid’s reputation. Too many development initiatives have been conceived as acts of charity, driven only by donor priorities, or wielded as tools of strategic leverage. This framing stripped individuals of meaningful agency and reinforced the very hierarchies development should seek to dismantle. The United States has sometimes stumbled here, delivering aid with an eye toward geopolitical returns—particularly during the Cold War or in fragile states—rather than fostering long-term, collaborative partnerships. Alternatively, a dignity-centered approach recognizes partner countries not as passive beneficiaries but as active political communities with their own aspirations, constraints, and expertise.

Americans hold mixed views of foreign aid, often overestimating its cost and misunderstanding its purpose. But when done well, aid is not charity—it’s an investment in shared security, strength, and prosperity. Call it cooperation, not aid. As former top U.S. health and defense officials have argued, cooperation remains essential to contain diseases before they become global threats and to address conflicts before they escalate. The case for economic development, though less frequently emphasized, proves no less compelling. Helping lower-income countries to build lasting prosperity can spur industrial growth, create meaningful jobs, ease migration pressures, and fortify the supply chains on which the United States increasingly depends.

If the United States wants meaningful engagement in Africa, Latin America, and beyond, it must move past rhetoric and discard outdated slogans, favoring strategies rooted in experimentation, local ownership, and mutual interest. That means prioritizing the transfer of know-how that fueled transformation in countries like Costa Rica and drives the growth of firms such as DIELA. It also means rejecting the false trade-versus-aid binary in favor of patient, principled cooperation."

The reason for the election was routinely misreported in Western Media.

The BBC, a cauldron of left leaning drivel said, “It (South Korea) is still recovering from the martial law crisis last December, when the president, Yoon Suk Yeol, tried to orchestrate a military takeover.”

Fact Check: False. The purpose of the six-hour declaration of Martial Law by former President Yoon Suk Yeol was to raid the National Election Commission (NEC) to retrieve evidence of election fraud.

No one was harmed, disappeared, or arrested during the six-hour period last December when President Yoon used his Constitutional authority to declare this period. There was not even a hint of a military takeover.

Lee Jae-myung, is the Democrat Candidate who is now the South Korean President after the June 3 election.

The Korean election made Fulton County, GA look trustworthy. Lee performed first class street theater wearing a visible bullet proof vest and often appearing behind bullet proof glass while denouncing the “Yoon Insurrectionists” and vowing to imprison all of them.

Lee’s theatrics eerily resembled the same script of Biden and Harris after the stolen 2020 election and their creation of a fortress around the U.S. Capitol to add drama to their sparsely attended inauguration.

Lee Jae-myung’s inauguration had a very small gathering on the lawn of the National Assembly which was outnumbered by the media on the inauguration platform. Stunning for someone who supposedly won the election by 6%.

U.S. Democrats work with SK Democrats and the South Korean Uniparty

Wherever former President Bill Clinton is, a fundraiser for the Clinton Foundation is likely occurring. Why was Bill Clinton suddenly in South Korea? Avoiding the Diddy trial? I haven’t found anyone who could cite a meeting he was at.

The mainstream media in South Korea is corrupt, they didn’t appear to report the presence of the former American President. “X” seemed to be one of the few reporting on Clinton’s time in Korea. The timing was suspicious.

One report given to us when we were in South Korea was that the power brokers behind the “populist” party (the People Power Party) that was running against the South Korean Democrat candidate, Lee Jae-myung, refused to release a very large amount of campaign funds to Kim Min-soo unless he agreed to turn the unicameral Korean National Assembly into a Parliamentarian System so that the PPP/SK Democrat Uniparty could relieve the South Korean Citizens from the burden of having to vote for a President.

Future Presidents would be elected by a new Parliamentary System in the National Assembly. Much of this drama coincidently occurred while Bill was in town. Kim turned down the offer of the PPP campaign money and ran on little but his principals while Lee enjoyed ample funding. The fix was in.

International Election Fraud Cartel

There are two disturbing outcomes out of the South Korean Election. First is that the Korean NEC is the apparent real government of South Korea and reports to no one.

The NEC has the power and authority to sue anyone who questions their work yet has no obligation to reveal anything through independent audit, review, or verification and validation. Hence President Yoon’s attempt to shine daylight on the NEC for a few hours.

The NEC seems to be run by a family and hires from family members outside of the Korean Civil Service system, which applies to the rest of the Korean Government. The NEC has been around for decades, running an unassailable election process, benefiting from tokens of appreciation from both parties.

The other issue is A-Web, this is an international body headquartered in Korea that stands for the Association of World Election Bodies.

This mysterious organization runs worldwide elections, appears to have received USAID funding per the bumper stickers on its website.

A-Web has multiple Memorandums of Understanding with the Korean National Election Commission.

One interesting story was brought to us on several occasions by different groups during our visit to South Korea. The story revealed that several Chinese operatives involved in running South Korean elections were allegedly arrested by South Korean Special Forces during the six-hour martial law by President Yoon and then handed over to the U.S. in January. True?

It seems unlikely and we couldn’t determine truth, but pictures shown to us by several different, unrelated groups looked realistic and in the world of the possible.

The flow of U.S. dollars to A-Web and likely to the NEC gives a lawful basis for investigation and attention by U.S. Federal Law Enforcement, U.S. Intelligence, Inspector Generals, and the U.S. Congress.

It is of note that since A-Web had been disrupted by the visit in December by President Yoon’s direction, a Populist was able to win in Poland.

China

It appears the corrupt Uniparty and International Election Cartel is now really controlled by China. China has established a massive presence in Korea that seems to have more influence than the historic and vaunted U.S. Forces Korea.

Chinese were liberally voting and counting the votes in South Korea. The U.S. Military, Intelligence, and Diplomatic footprint has been compartmented out of the picture by the Korean Democrat Party and not tipped off by the PPP.

The U.S. elements in South Korea are living the good life and focusing on Karaoke, oblivious to what’s going on around them. I asked a very significant conservative personality in South Korea how did this pervasive Chinese presence occur?

His answer, “John, they looked just like us, they threw around lots of money, and you wouldn’t know they were Chinese until they spoke.

It’s not over in South Korea, but the three groupings of corruption threw the outcome for this election. Former Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn has dropped out of the PPP to form a totally new Party outside the South Korean Uniparty controlled by China.

They have already held many rallies that drew far larger crowds than Lee Jae-myung.

Their goal is to Make Korea Great Again – they have five years until the next Presidential election, if Lee makes it that far. Lee violated U.S. Law by giving $8M to North Korea, it remains to be seen if the U.S. carries out sanctions against him.

President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk celebrated their efforts to slash federal spending before Musk stepped away from his White House work. Musk wore a black DOGE hat over a bruised right eye that he blamed on his young son’s punch. That was May 30 in the Oval Office. Days later, the two billionaires were punching at each other on the social media platforms they own.

Their fight began over federal tax and spending legislation, with Musk calling a Trump-backed bill “a disgusting abomination” and Trump saying he was “very disappointed” with Musk. Soon, Musk claimed credit for Trump and Republicans winning in 2024, and Trump threatened to cut off Musk’s companies’ federal contracts.

I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025

The public display of animosity called into question the fate of months of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) work.

Under Musk’s oversight and with Trump’s approval, DOGE axed billions of dollars in grants for state health departments and scientific research. It gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers. It all but shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the decades-old department that provides food and healthcare to people in other countries.

Still, as Musk ended his work with DOGE, it was clear that the group’s cost-cutting achievements fell short of Musk’s goals. A week before Trump won his second term, Musk said he expected to cut “at least $2 trillion”, without identifying a timeframe for doing it. He later lowered that to $1 trillion.

But both figures were wildly unrealistic. Even if Musk could have eliminated every dollar of non-defence discretionary spending – everything from air traffic control, medical research, federal prosecutors and prisons to border control, US embassies and national parks – he wouldn’t have reached his $1 trillion goal.

As of early June, DOGE’s online “wall of receipts” accounting of federal dollars cut said that the government had cut $180 billion. But analyses by PolitiFact, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the conservative American Enterprise Institute showed that the tallies Musk provided were flawed. And total 2025 federal spending under Trump has continued to grow.

Nat Malkus, an education policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said DOGE’s cuts showed an “appetite for recklessness”, and its error and exaggeration-filled wall of receipts provided “ample grounds for scepticism” about its accuracy. “Beyond that, the receipts only cover a fraction of their actions, making their accomplishments and savings impossible to verify,” Malkus said.

Savings amount unclear

DOGE’s “wall of receipts” reported that the $180bn savings represented a combination of actions, including lease and grant cancellations, “fraud and improper payment deletion” and eliminating employees.

During their May 30 news conference, Musk predicted savings would rise to $1 trillion, but their public dispute made DOGE’s future more uncertain. A few top lieutenants had already departed; dozens of DOGE employees remained.

DOGE says its wall of receipts is incomplete: “We are working to upload all of our receipts in a digestible and transparent manner consistent with applicable rules and regulations,” the website says, calling its list “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30 percent of total savings.”

And it has errors. For example, DOGE said it would save $740,457 by ending a lease that housed records for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. But the federal government had already planned to end that lease in 2025. The property’s leasing company told PolitiFact on May 30 that the government is still using the property and paying rent. If the government leaves before September, it will have to continue paying under the lease’s terms, unless another tenant is secured.

Some of DOGE’s contract and grant cancellations are being litigated, and the government may ultimately be required to fulfil them.

“Even for grants and contracts that DOGE cut, the claimed savings may never be realised,” Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said.

The $180bn figure was aspirational and projected, PolitiFact found.

“Itemised, verifiable cuts – those with receipts – are roughly half that amount,” said Dominik Lett, a budget policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Of those itemised cuts, there are numerous clerical errors and inflated savings values.”

Government officials did not respond to our questions about how many federal employees were cut. The New York Times reported that as of May 12, the government reduced its workforce by roughly 135,000, including cuts and buyouts. That amounts to a tiny portion of the 2.4 million federal workforce, with similarly modest savings in salaries. The Reuters news agency, counting early retirements in addition to buyouts and firings, said the tally was 260,000.

When 75,000 employees who took buyouts come off the books in October, that will save about $10bn a year, or 0.1 percent of federal spending, Jessica Riedl, an expert on the federal budget at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in an essay for The Atlantic. (Trump quoted the 75,000 figure during his May 30 news conference.) But the government could end up hiring contractors to perform some of that work, further shrinking those savings.

Not every agency or department faced widespread cuts. The Justice Department’s staffing was reduced by about 1 percent, The New York Times found. But nearly all employees were cut at USAID and AmeriCorps. Nearly half of the Education Department’s staff were cut.

Federal government spending continues to rise. In April 2025, total spending was $594bn, $27bn more than in April 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s a 5 percent increase. The largest spending decrease – $17bn – came in the Department of Education, which Trump promised to eliminate. But Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid outlays rose, as did some department spending, including in agriculture and defence.

Some of DOGE’s line items show savings of zero dollars, which a White House spokesperson said means that the money has been spent but won’t be renewed, such as for news subscriptions or training. It also showed some negative values for grants; a State Department spokesperson said they were caused by an input error that had since been corrected, although it was still on the site as of about noon ET (16:00 GMT) on June 5.

It’s unclear whether DOGE’s spending cuts will be permanent because federal law requires the executive branch to send proposed cuts, known as “rescissions”, to Congress for approval. The White House on June 3 sent a $9.4bn package of rescission cuts to Congress that includes cutting foreign aid.

“DOGE can kill projects, but the spending doesn’t become savings until Congress votes to ‘unspend’ the money,” Malkus said.

DOGE also increased some government costs, such as those incurred when defending against lawsuits.

DOGE abruptly cut programmes but failed to find mass fraud

DOGE left no state untouched, according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It terminated leases and grants to health departments, universities and volunteer programmes across the country.

DOGE listed terminations of hundreds of millions of dollars in state health department grants, which represented some of the group’s biggest “savings”. These cuts targeted health departments in states including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

The administration said the cuts mostly affected money used for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Twenty-three states challenged the cuts in a lawsuit that argued the move caused states “tremendous chaos” including “immediate harm to public health initiatives and the termination of large numbers of state and local public health employees and contractors”. In mid-May, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the federal government to release the frozen funding.

“These funds support state and local health departments in combatting infectious diseases, as well as offering mental health services and funding addiction treatment programmes,” said Lynn Sutfin, a state Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson in Michigan, one of the state plaintiffs.

Other cuts included nearly $400m in AmeriCorps grants, resulting in the terminations of more than 32,000 AmeriCorps members and volunteers, and the historic gutting of USAID, the nation’s federal international humanitarian and development arm.

One local AmeriCorps programme, Serve Louisiana, filed a lawsuit to stop cuts to its $700,000 grant that aimed to place 37 workers with Louisiana nonprofits, including a food bank, a library and Boys and Girls Clubs, through August. As of June 2, the lawsuit was ongoing.

“Our nonprofit partners are now scrambling to adapt without the help they counted on,” Serve Louisiana Executive Director Lisa Moore said.

USAID programmes aimed to reduce hunger and disease and promote democracy globally. In fiscal year 2024, USAID made up 0.3 percent of the federal budget. Weeks after Trump’s inauguration, DOGE froze nearly all of USAID’s spending and terminated nearly all employees.

Musk boasted on February 3 that DOGE had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, and two weeks later he wielded a chainsaw at a conservative political event to symbolise what he said was his attack on federal bureaucracy.

USAID’s dismantling had sprawling global effects.

In Ukraine – the largest recipient of USAID funds since Russia’s 2022 invasion – regional media outlets lost funding and medical charities shuttered programmes that screened for and treated tuberculosis and HIV, NPR reported.

US diplomats in Malawi said US funding cuts to the United Nations World Food Programme increased criminal activity, sexual violence and human trafficking in a large refugee camp, ProPublica reported. American embassy officials in Kenya said funding cuts to refugee camp food programmes led to violent demonstrations, ProPublica said.

People also died because of the chaotic aid disruptions, according to Al Jazeera, NPR, The Associated Press, and other news organisations.

The consequences are still unspooling.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that up to four million people in Africa might die from treatable diseases without USAID funding. Former USAID officials told Reuters that, because of the cuts, food rations worth $98m that could supply 3.5 million people for a month are decaying in warehouses and some are likely to be destroyed. The World Health Organization cautioned in March that USAID cuts could trigger a global increase in tuberculosis cases and deaths.

Musk and Trump said that DOGE would ferret out fraud, too. Government reports predating Trump’s current term show fraud is a real problem, but so far DOGE has not proven that it has recently uncovered mass fraud.

A White House spokesperson said there had been 50 criminal referrals stemming from DOGE’s work and pointed to three individuals charged for voting as a noncitizen in New York or Florida. Statements by federal prosecutors said that DOGE assisted with the cases. Such cases had been prosecuted before DOGE’s creation."

U.S. Africa Command, which does everything from helping the Somalian military target strikes on al-Shabaab to sending Army civil affairs soldiers to build schools in Cameroon, is working out what their new role on the continent will look like as the U.S. halts aid that was meant to stabilize those countries and make it easier for them to defend themselves.

“Some things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,” AFRICOM commander Marine Gen. Michael Langley, speaking from the 2025 African Chiefs of Defense Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, told reporters Thursday. “So we're asking you to step up and burden-share with us.”

For two decades, U.S. troops have deployed to Africa for exercises like African Lion and Flintlock, which improve the U.S.’s ability to operate in Africa at the same time as it trains up local militaries to be able to defend themselves against their biggest threats.

“Let me speak plainly about the threats we're facing, especially in the Sahel region—including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger—it is the flash point of prolonged conflict and growing instability,” Langley said. “It is the epicenter of terrorism on the globe.”

ISIS and al-Qaida-affiliated groups are “thriving” in the Sahel, he added. Burkina Faso’s government has lost control of vast swathes of their own territory.

“Extremist groups are gaining ground and also expanding their ambitions,” he said. “Therein lies the threat to the homeland, as they gain in capability and capacity.”

In that vein, the U.S. has for decades worked with those countries to train their militaries as well as provide aid for education, food and clean water, ensuring populations have basic necessities that keep them from turning to terror groups to survive.

Groups like al-Shabaab, al-Qaida’s biggest and most well-funded affiliate, are already anticipating an opportunity to amp up operations as Somalia loses U.S. Agency for International Development funding.

“Well, I'll just say this, what I've seen with al-Shabaab—they're making assumptions that there's going to be gaps in aid in certain regions across Somalia, and there's shadow governments,” Langley said. “They're trying to exploit that scene. But the quicker the federal government of Somalia steps up and goes in those areas—and they're already continuing operations in those areas, so time will tell.”

With that aid pulled, AFRICOM is urging partner nations to step up where the U.S. has fallen back.

“Now, we recognize that direct U.S. assistance must adapt to an updated strategy aligned with national defense priorities,” Langley said. “Our goal is not to do more for Africa. It's to help Africa do more for itself. African nations must assume more responsibility for their security. The U.S. will continue to support, but support will be on our overlapping security interests and must be matched by local leadership.”

U.S. military support will continue to include intelligence sharing, Langley said, as well as partner exercises, the “most credible” way to increase African countries’ military capacity while also benefitting U.S. troops.

At the same time, China can and has stepped in to provide aid to Africa and otherwise fill gaps left by the U.S., though their influence model depends more on lending to African governments.

“Last September at the forum on China and Africa cooperation, Chairman Xi [Jinping] said they're going to step up their engagements across Africa,” Langley said.

African troops attend professional military education programs in Beijing, he said, similarly to the U.S.’s International Military Education Program.

“Then they also said they're going to increase security and training in a number of countries, so they’re trying to replicate what we do,” he said. “They're stepping it up and trying to replicate every type of thing, whether it be advise-and-assist type of training and specialized military domains, or putting on exercises like they did in the fall.”"

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Republic of China

Updated: June 11, 2025 20:41

In September 2024, the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was successfully held, opening a new chapter of China and Africa building an all-weather community with a shared future for the new era. President Xi Jinping and leaders from the African side jointly charted the future of China-Africa relations, and put forward a six-point proposition on China and Africa's joint pursuit of modernization and ten partnership actions China will take with Africa for modernization.

The world today is increasingly marked by changes and turbulence. The United States is abusing tariffs in the name of ""reciprocity,"" putting its self-interest above the common good of the international community. What the U.S. has been doing severely infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, severely disrupts the global economic order, and causes tremendous difficulties to the economic and social development and improvement of people's livelihoods of African nations and other developing countries.

Faced with common challenges, China and Africa have enhanced solidarity and coordination and followed on the strategic common understandings between the leaders of both sides with firm actions to deepen political mutual trust. The two sides have maintained policy communication through high-level exchanges. President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the 38th African Union Summit. Leaders of China have visited Africa for multiple times. For 35 years in a row, the Chinese foreign minister visited Africa on the first overseas trip at the start of a year. Delegations from Africa, including the one led by Kenyan President William Ruto, paid official visits to China. China and Africa have rendered each other stronger support in safeguarding the shared interests of the Global South and defending international fairness and justice, and been steadfast in backing each other's efforts to safeguard sovereignty, security, and development interests. China and Africa have been working together to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and implement the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative. Both sides defend the U.N.-centered international system, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter. And both sides actively participate in and promote the building of a more just and equitable global governance system. China supports South Africa in hosting the G20 Johannesburg Summit, supports the African Union in playing an important role in the G20, and supports Nigeria and Uganda in becoming BRICS partner countries.

China and Africa have stepped up coordination in turning the strategic common understandings between the leaders of both sides into strong momentum for China-Africa high-quality cooperation, providing solid and reliable support and drive for Africa's modernization. China had in-depth communication with the Republic of the Congo, the African co-chair of FOCAC, and extensive consultations with African countries, and jointly made a timetable and roadmap for the implementation of the follow-up actions after the Summit. Since the Summit, China has provided RMB130.32 billion yuan in financial support to the African side, and RMB139.95 billion yuan in insurance coverage for China-Africa cooperation. Early outcomes of the follow-up actions have been achieved.

From June 10 to 12, 2025, the Ministerial Meeting of Coordinators on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was held in Hunan. China and Africa have conducted overall review on the implementation of the follow-up actions since the Summit, and communication and consultation on future plans. To better present the key points and highlights of the implementation of Summit follow-up actions, the Chinese side summarized some of the highly representative outcomes in line with the ten partnership actions, and worked out this list of outcomes containing 35 items in 10 categories.

I.Mutual Learning Among Civilizations

1.Deepening governance experience sharing. Members of various political parties from multiple African countries visited China and had exchanges with the Chinese side. The Former Liberation Movements of Southern Africa Leading Cadres Workshop was successfully held.

2. Enhancing cooperation between think tanks. China has made continued efforts to advance the establishment of the China-Africa knowledge network for development and has held the symposium on the China-Africa knowledge network for development. China has also been working on establishing Chinese cultural centers in Mozambique and Kenya and the China-Africa research centers in Senegal and Morocco. Concerning parties are to establish a China-Africa publishing association by the end of this year in the principle of voluntary participation. The China-Africa-UNESCO dialogue on education and cultural heritage protection, the 14th Meeting of the China-Africa Think Tanks Forum, the Fourth Conference on Dialogue Between Chinese and African Civilization, and the China-Africa Consortium of Universities Exchange Mechanism Annual Conference were successfully held.

3. Continuously strengthening exchanges and cooperation on the rule of law. China has signed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation with relevant African countries. The FOCAC Legal Forum (2025) and China-Africa Prosecutorial Cooperation Forum will be held in this July and October respectively. By the end of this year, the Chinese side will hold training courses of foreign assistance for legal and judicial professionals, and will invite judicial and administrative officials from relevant Africa countries to participate.

II.Trade Prosperity

4. China-Africa trade volume in 2024 reached US$295.6 billion, setting a new record high. The bilateral trade between January and March in 2025 registered US$72.6 billion, increasing by 2.7 percent year on year. The zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines given to all LDCs having diplomatic relations with China has come to effect since December 1, 2024, increasing export from relevant countries into China. China has signed a framework agreement on economic partnership for shared development with more than 20 African countries, and is actively promoting modular negotiation. This marks a distinct contrast with the U.S. action of imposing tariff wars on all African countries.

The World Food Programme has been forced to reduce food rations in the camp by a third.

Series: The End of Aid: Trump Destroyed USAID. What Happens Now? More in this series Caret

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

American diplomats in at least two countries have recently delivered internal reports to Washington that reflect a grim new reality taking hold abroad: The Trump administration’s sudden withdrawal of foreign aid is bringing about the violence and chaos that many had warned would come.

The vacuum left after the U.S. abandoned its humanitarian commitments has destabilized some of the most fragile locations in the world and thrown refugee camps further into unrest, according to State Department correspondence and notes obtained by ProPublica.

The assessments are not just predictions about the future but detailed accounts of what has already occurred, making them among the first such reports from inside the Trump administration to surface publicly — though experts suspect they will not be the last. The diplomats warned in their correspondence that stopping aid may undermine efforts to combat terrorism.

In the southeastern African country of Malawi, U.S. funding cuts to the United Nations’ World Food Programme have “yielded a sharp increase in criminality, sexual violence, and instances of human trafficking” within a large refugee camp, U.S. embassy officials told the State Department in late April. The world’s largest humanitarian food provider, the WFP projects a 40% decrease in funding compared to last year and has been forced to reduce food rations in Malawi’s sprawling Dzaleka refugee camp by a third.

To the north, the U.S. embassy in Kenya reported that news of funding cuts to refugee camps’ food programs led to violent demonstrations, according to a previously unreported cable from early May. During one protest, police responded with gunfire and wounded four people. Refugees have also died at food distribution centers, the officials wrote in the cable, including a pregnant woman who died under a stampede. Aid workers said they expected more people to get hurt “as vulnerable households become increasingly desperate.”

“It is devastating, but it’s not surprising,” Eric Schwartz, a former State Department assistant secretary and member of the National Security Council during Democratic administrations, told ProPublica. “It’s all what people in the national security community have predicted.”

“I struggle for adjectives to adequately describe the horror that this administration has visited on the world,” Schwartz added. “It keeps me up at night.”

In response to a detailed list of questions, a State Department spokesperson said in an email: “It is grossly misleading to blame unrest and violence around the world on America. No one can reasonably expect the United States to be equipped to feed every person on earth or be responsible for providing medication for every living human.”

The spokesperson also said that “an overwhelming majority” of the WFP programs that the Trump administration inherited, including those in Malawi and Kenya, are still active.

But the U.S. funds the WFP on a yearly basis. For 2025, the Trump administration so far hasn’t approved any money in either country, forcing the organization to drastically slash food programs.

In Kenya, for example, the WFP will cut its rations in June down to 28% — or less than 600 calories a day per person — a low never seen before, the WFP’s Kenya country director Lauren Landis told ProPublica. The WFP’s standard minimum for adults is 2,100 calories per day.

“We are living off the fumes of what was delivered in late 2024 or early 2025,” Landis said. On a recent visit to a facility treating malnourished children younger than 5, she said she saw kids who were “walking skeletons like I haven’t seen in a decade.”

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restore safety and security around the world. At the same time, his administration, working alongside Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, swiftly dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, canceling thousands of government-funded foreign aid programs they considered wasteful. More than 80% of USAID’s operations were terminated, which crippled lifesaving humanitarian efforts around the world.

Musk, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said that DOGE’s cuts to humanitarian aid have targeted fraudulent payments to organizations but are not contributing to widespread deaths. “Show us any evidence whatsoever that that is true,” he said recently. “It’s false.”

For decades, American administrations run by both parties saw humanitarian diplomacy, or “soft power,” as a cost-effective measure to help stabilize volatile but strategically important regions and provide basic needs for people who might otherwise turn to international adversaries. Those investments, experts say, help prevent regional conflict and war that may embroil the U.S. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Jim Mattis, who was defense secretary during Trump’s first administration, told Congress in 2013 when he led U.S. Central Command.

Food insecurity has long been closely linked with regional turmoil. But despite promises from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that lifesaving operations would continue amid widespread cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has terminated funding to WFP for several countries. Nearly 50% of the WFP’s budget came from the U.S. in 2024.

Since February, U.S. officials throughout the developing world have issued urgent warnings forecasting that the Trump administration’s decision to suddenly cut off help to desperate populations could exacerbate humanitarian crises and threaten U.S. national security interests, records show. In one cable, diplomats in the Middle East communicated concerns that stopping aid could empower groups like the Taliban and undermine efforts to address terrorism, the narcotics trade and illegal immigration. The shift may also “significantly de-stabilize the transitioning” region and “only serve to benefit ISIS’ standing,” officials warned in other correspondence. “It could put US troops in the region at risk.”

Embassies in Africa have delivered similar messages. “We are deeply concerned that suddenly discontinuing all USAID counter terrorism-focused stabilization and humanitarian programs in Somalia … will immediately and negatively affect U.S. national security interests,” the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, wrote in February. USAID’s role in helping the military prevent newly liberated territory — “purchased at a high cost of blood and treasure” — from getting back into the hands of terrorists “is indisputable, and irreplaceable,” the officials added.

The embassy in Nigeria described how stop-work orders had caused lapses in oversight that put U.S. resources at risk of being diverted to criminal or terrorist groups. (A February whistleblower complaint alleged USAID-purchased computers were stolen from health centers there.) And U.S. officials said the Kenyan government “faces an impending humanitarian crisis for over 730,000 refugees” without additional resources, as local officials struggle to confront al-Shabaab, a major terrorist threat in the region, while also maintaining security inside the country’s refugee camps.

In early April, Jeremy Lewin — an attorney in his late 20s with no prior government experience who is currently in charge of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance and running USAID operations — ordered the end of WFP grants altogether in more than a dozen countries. (Amid outcry, he later reinstated a few of them.) The State Department spokesperson said the agency was responding on Lewin’s behalf.

In Kenya, the WFP expects a malnutrition crisis after rations are cut to a fourth of the standard minimum, Landis said. She is also concerned about the security of her staff, who already travel with police escorts, given the likelihood that there will be more protests and that al-Shabaab might make further incursions into the camps.

In order for the U.S. to deliver its usual food aid to Kenya by the end of the year, it needed to be put on a boat already, Landis said. That has not happened.

In recent days, South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia have begged a visiting government delegation from the U.S. not to cut food rations any further, according to a cable documenting the visit. Aid workers in another group of camps in North Africa reported that they expect to run out of funding by the end of May for a program that fights malnutrition for 8,600 pregnant and nursing mothers.

Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world, Malawi has been a relative beacon of stability in a region that’s seen numerous civil wars and unrest in recent decades. Yet in early March, officials there warned Washington counterparts that cuts to the more than $300 million USAID planned to provide to the country in aid a year would dramatically increase “the effects of the worsening economy already in motion.”

At the time, 10 employees from a USAID-funded nonprofit had recently shown up unannounced at USAID’s offices in the capital Lilongwe asking for their unpaid wages after the U.S. froze funding. The group left without incident, and it’s unclear if they were paid, but officials reported that they expected countries around the world would face similar issues and were closely monitoring for “increased risks to the safety and security of Embassy personnel.” (Former employees at another nonprofit in a nearby country also raided their organization “out of desperation for not being paid,” according to State Department records.)

An hour’s drive from the nation’s capital, Dzaleka is a former prison that was transformed into a refugee camp in the 1990s to house people fleeing war in neighboring Mozambique. In the decades since, it has ballooned, filling with people running from conflicts in Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. The camp, which was built to hold around 10,000, is now home to more than 55,000 people.

Iradukunda Devota, a refugee from Burundi, came to Malawi when she was 3 and has lived at Dzaleka for 23 years. She now works for Inua Advocacy, which provides legal services and advocates on behalf of refugees in the camp. She said tension is high amid rumors that food and other aid will be cut further. Since 2023, the Malawi government has prohibited refugees from living or working outside the camp, and there has already been an increase in crime and substance abuse after food was cut earlier this year. “This is happening because people are hungry,” Devota told ProPublica. “They have nowhere to turn to.”

Now, the Malawi government is likely to close its borders to refugees in response to the funding crisis and congestion in Dzaleka, the WFP’s country representative told the State Department, according to agency records.

Diplomats continue to warn the Trump administration of even worse to come. The WFP expects to suspend food assistance in Dzaleka entirely in July.

“The WFP anticipates violent protests,” the embassy told State Department officials, “which could potentially embroil host communities and refugees, and targeting of UN and WFP offices when the pipeline eventually breaks.”

NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. Methods We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. Results While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO’s recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Conclusion Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX’s full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya’s goal of Universal Health Coverage.

Background Neonatal sepsis (NNS) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality during the first month of life [1]. One of the primary contributors to NNS is the development of omphalitis, which is the infection of the umbilical stump [2]. This infection often arises as a result of improper and/or inadequate umbilical cord care practices, which can ultimately lead to neonatal mortality in up to 15% of cases [1]. While this is relatively uncommon in developed nations, it is a significant contributor to neonatal mortality in developing nations [1], such as Kenya. Due to this burden of NNS secondary to omphalitis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided context-specific recommendations for newborns in settings where: (1) harmful traditional substances are prevalent and (2) the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) exceeds 30 in 1000 live births [3]. This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis of individual patient data, involving 177 neonates from five trials with a total of 129,391 newborns [3]. CHX for cord care has been shown to reduce NMR by up to 23% and prevents infection by 38–68% [4]. Furthermore, observational studies from low-income countries suggest that replacing harmful traditional cord care practices with antiseptics could save many newborn lives use [5,6]. However, this recommendation remains tentative due to the lack of data on sepsis and an inadequately described search strategy in the systemic review cited [5,6]. Moreover, the exclusion of observational studies from low-income settings (due to the absence of randomized controlled trials) limits its relevance for LMICs. The recommendation of dry cord care for LMICs that otherwise meet the criteria is therefore questionable, especially since the Cochrane review itself found no significant difference in infection rates between placebo and antiseptic use [5,7]. Kenya has a 29.3% prevalence of NNS [8], and the incidence rate of omphalitis is estimated at between 20–77 of every 1000 live births of newborns delivered within healthcare facilities [9]. The incidence rate of omphalitis is purported to be higher in at-home births [9]. The NMR has been documented 21 deaths per 1,000 live births, accounting for 66% of infant deaths and 51% of under-5 deaths [10]. However, this NMR varies widely between the counties of Kenya. A 2018 study conducted in Machakos County revealed that, of all the admissions in the newborn unit, 34% constituted cases of NNS and were associated with 15% of the deaths reported [9]. WHO’s recommendation for the contextual use of CHX for cord care is a transition from the previous recommendation of the use of surgical spirit [11], a recommendation which was also reflected in Kenya’s 2009 National Guidelines for Quality Perinatal Care [12]. Surgical spirit is no longer recommended for umbilical cord care due to its limited efficacy in preventing infections, potential to irritate newborn skin, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives like CHX [11,13–15]. In 2016, however, the Government of Kenya recommended the use of CHX in all births to ensure equal standards in healthcare provision for all citizens of the country [16], therefore adopting the new WHO guidelines nation-wide [17]. Since Kenya’s adoption of the WHO recommendation on the use of CHX in all neonates in 2016, the implementation has been set to take three phases: (1) preparation, (2) planning, and (3) execution. Expounded, this process includes the alignment of policy, developing guidelines, introducing the product, training of service providers, generating demand for the product, and finally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A 2016 study by Muriuki et al. found that HCWs in rural Kenya widely accepted the use of CHX for umbilical cord care, citing benefits such as faster healing, reduced infections, ease of use, and positive community feedback [18]. For successful scale-up, they emphasized the need for community sensitization, proper training, consistent supply, clear guidelines, and inclusive service delivery approaches [18]. However, a 2021 cross-sectional study at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital found that while most mothers received some education on CHX use, both mothers and HCWs demonstrated poor understanding of its proper application [9]. Different counties are expected to have achieved different levels of adoption given that healthcare in Kenya is devolved to the county level with the national level providing policy guidance. Given that Kenya has a goal to further increase the uptake of CHX treatment to above 80% in all health care facilities by 2026 [4], the adoption of CHX for cord care has yet to undergo M&E through the perspectives of HCWs. The CHX uptake in Kiambu county is 40.1% [18], and therefore, understanding HCW experiences with cord care practices in the county would be essential to shape health policy and highlighting gaps in its implementation.

Methods Study design The study adopted an exploratory qualitative design using key informant interviews (KIIs) guided by semi-structured question guides, and which were conducted between 6th October 2022–9th November 2022. The data was collected from six health facilities in Kiambu County. Study setting This study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya, which has a population of over 2.4 million people. The location coordinates are 10 10’S 36050’E, and it neighbors six other counties, namely Nairobi City and Kajiado Counties to the South, Machakos to the East, Murang’a to the North East, Nyandarua to the North west, and Nakuru County to the West [19]. The county is 60% urban and 40% rural due to its proximity to the capital city Nairobi. The county has 505 health facilities, comprising 108 public, 64 faith-based, and 333 privately owned facilities. In Kenya’s health system, Level 1 refers to community-based services (e.g., health promotion and preventive care), Level 2 to dispensaries, Level 3 to health centers, Level 4 to sub-county hospitals, and Level 5 to county referral hospitals. Maternity services are typically offered at Level 3 (health centers) and above, including private and faith-based hospitals. Therefore, this study gathered insights from HCWs working in Level 3, 4, and 5 public facilities, as well as private hospitals. One of the Level 5 hospitals (Thika Level 5 Hospital) in this study also functions as a teaching hospital for medical and nursing students. Local context CHX for newborn umbilical cord care is available in two formulations: gel and solution [20]. Both forms are recommended by the WHO and are included in the Kenya Essential Medicines List as well as in postnatal care guidelines [20–22]. In line with this, Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) endorses the availability and use of both CHX formulations [20]. The choice between the dosage formulations used depends on what is acceptable to mothers, caregivers, HCWs and availability [23]. According to the national guidelines, immediately post-delivery, a HCW should apply CHX to the newborn’s umbilical cord using sterile gloves. The antiseptic is applied to the base, stump, and tip of the cord [20]. For gel formulations, the HCW uses their index finger to spread it; for the solution, the dropper is used to apply CHX directly. The CHX is not cleaned off after application. In the postnatal period, CHX should be applied once daily until the seventh day or until the cord naturally detaches: whichever happens first. Mothers and/or caregivers are instructed on how to apply CHX at home following the same procedures, but in lieu of sterile gloves, they are advised to thoroughly wash their hands before each application. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), now defunct, but which was active during the period of the study, had a program called Linda Mama that covered the costs of antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for all pregnant women [24]. However, it notably excluded the cost of CHX, and currently, there is no government-sponsored program providing CHX free of charge to mothers during the postnatal period. Study population and sampling The study population consisted of over 2,600 HCWs providing health services in Kiambu County during the study period. No formal sample size was calculated and we applied the information saturation principle [25]. Two providers were targeted in every unit (with a target of 30 HCWs) during the study’s formulation, however some units were understaffed during the study and hence only had one HCW interviewed. The cadre and respective facility of the sample are presented in Table 1. PPT PowerPoint slide

Exclusion criteria - HCWs who were not directly involved in newborn care or who declined to provide informed consent and who had less than 6 months of experience with cord care. Data collection A total of 38 KIIs were conducted between 6th October 2022 and 9th November 2022. All interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, JMG and BNO, both holding Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degrees. JMG serves as the Kiambu county pharmacist and holds a PhD in pharmacy, while BNO is a researcher with experience in qualitative data analysis. Both researchers received training prior to data collection to ensure consistency and quality. The interviews were conducted in English, but participants were allowed to respond in either English or Kiswahili. BNO, who is bilingual and fluent in both written and spoken English and Standard Kiswahili, translated the KIIs, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim directly from Kiswahili into English when applicable. Each participant was assigned a unique index number (1–38), and quotations are referenced using the format: HospitalName_Cadre_IndexNumber. Data management Kobo Toolbox software was used to collect and manage data, with all data coded to conceal the participants’ identities. To ensure data security, electronic data collected via KoboCollect were encrypted and password-protected on the devices. After transfer, data files were securely stored on password-protected computers and backed up on a secure cloud platform with restricted access. NVivo project files were similarly protected to maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the analysis process. Data analysis Interview transcripts were imported into NVivo software to assist in the classification, sorting, and coding of data into central themes and subthemes. The coding process followed a two-cycle approach. In the first cycle, value coding was used to capture participants’ attitudes and values, reflecting their perceptions and experiences. The second cycle involved focused and pattern coding. Focused coding developed specific categories without focusing on their properties, while pattern coding grouped similar codes into meaningful units for theme identification [26–28]. NVivo’s platform played a crucial role in facilitating this multi-level coding process, ensuring consistency in the analysis framework by identifying recurring patterns and connections. The research questions and interview guide informed the coding frame, allowing for accurate classification of notable data segments to reveal dominant themes. The integration of value, focused, and pattern coding in both cycles ensured a comprehensive and structured analysis of the interview data [26–28].BNO, JMG, and PKJ also independently reviewed the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data and identify initial codes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency and reliability. Ethical considerations and approvals Upon arrival at the various study sites, verbal consent was initially sought from the manager of each facility unit, followed by written consent from the hospital medical superintendent. Prior to the initiation of data collection, participants were informed about the study’s objectives and their role as respondents. They were assured that participation was entirely voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. All data collected by the researchers were treated as confidential and utilized exclusively for this study. Access to the materials was restricted to the investigators, and stringent data management protocols were implemented to uphold the confidentiality of the study subjects. Approval was obtained at various administrative levels, including county and sub-county authorities before the study commenced. Ethical clearance was secured from the University of Nairobi/Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Review Committee [P470/05/2022], County Government of Kiambu Department of Health Services, Kiambu County [KIAMBU/HRDU/22/09/14/RA_GITHINJI], and a research license was obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation [NACOSTI/P/22/20446].

Results Demographic characteristics of participants A total of 38 HCWs were interviewed, as depicted in Table 1. The mean age of respondents was 35.6 years (Range: 23–57 years). The HCWs interviewed had a mean of 9.4 years of professional experience, with a median of 7.5 years, a mode of 7 years, and a range spanning from 0.5 to 30 years. In terms of time spent at their current stations, the average was 4.4 years, with a median of 3 years, a mode of 1 year, and a range from the minimum of 0.5 years to 22 years. Participants had an average practice duration of 9 years. Findings The transcripts drawn from recordings of KIIs held with selected HCWs were analyzed, and themes emerged as 33 files with 52 references. Some themes mirrored the guiding questions in the semi-structured questionnaire, as shown in the coding tree as Fig 1. PPT PowerPoint slide

Cord care practices in Kiambu county 1. National policy recommendation We sought to understand the general cord care practices in various health facilities across Kiambu County by interviewing HCWs. According to MoH guidelines, the use of CHX for cord care has been officially recommended, with the directive being disseminated from the central government to the county level. This was confirmed by a participant from Nazareth Hospital, who stated, “first of all, we have the policy that is an order that came from Kiambu County from the Ministry of Health that chlorhexidine should be used” (Nazareth_Pharmacist_25). The majority of participants acknowledged the existence of the MoH guidelines recommending CHX for cord care, confirmed that this policy had been communicated to health facilities and gave a description of the same policy in their responses. “So after birth, when you cut the cord, immediately we use the chlorhexidine, and after, we use it once a day, once a day after delivery until now the mothers goes home and you instruct them to use it until the cord dries off and falls off.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “…the next thing is to maintain hygiene of the cord, and this is done by applying an antiseptic. Commonly we use chlorhexidine, either the gel or the solution.” (Kiambu_ Paediatrician_36) “...The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX]...” (Thika_Midwife_13) 2. Facility-level departures from national recommendations HCWs mentioned that surgical spirit remained the predominant choice in practice, indicating a reluctance to fully transition from previous guidelines. In fact, almost half (41.7%) of participants reported having prior experience with surgical spirit before being required to switch to CHX, which was a new product in their facilities. Some facilities reported not using CHX at all, relying solely on surgical spirit for cord care. This variation in practice highlights the need for further investigation into the slow adoption of CHX in these settings, despite the existence of formal guidelines. Furthermore, despite clear directives, Thika Level 5 Hospital actively deviated from the National Guidelines, opting instead to follow its own facility-based protocol of dry cord care. “Here in our health facility... We discussed with our pediatrician and we just decided to leave the cord just like that. Don’t put anything, don’t put water, don’t put the spirit, and don’t put chlorhexidine, as long as you keep it clean. And we have not had any case of sepsis... The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX].” But then we are agreed for us, we don’t use it here, we have not been using it, and we have not had any cases of neonatal sepsis.” (Thika_Midwife_13) “So the current cord care practice in Thika Level 5 I would say, predominantly because that’s where I practice is dry cord care. I hardly do surgical spirit or chlorhexidine or any other medication directly with the cord.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_12) “And what I’ve noted, there is less uptake of chlorhexidine use for cord care compared to the surgical spirit.... the pediatrician and also other practitioners [are] persistent on the use of surgical spirit as opposed to chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “So currently, in Kiambu County, there are different things that are being done … some places and institutions that are using chlorhexidine for cord care. Then a number of institutions are using surgical spirit. There are some people who even believe on doing nothing to cord care. There are people who are using normal saline for cord care.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_37) “…I just know most of the time, they don’t even use that chlorhexidine. They use surgical spirit.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_18) 3. Mothers’ use of blended and traditional cord care methods A minor theme emerged in which some HCWs reported that mothers used multiple cord care methods, often influenced by either their past experiences or family advice, or both. For example, if surgical spirit had been ineffective with their first baby, they would switch to CHX for subsequent children, and vice versa. In some cases, mothers who delivered during the era of previous guidelines recommending surgical spirit continued to favour it. Other practices included the use of saliva, a traditional method still common in our context. “There is the use of … saliva, especially for the traditional mothers” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) “One challenge is that mothers out there, they have other methods of doing cord care. When you teach them how to do it, they go at home and they’re taught by other relatives how to do it … Like they will buy spirit because the other baby they used spirit, or they will use another thing like savlon that’s hindering proper use of the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “some mothers are resistant to change, especially those who delivered much earlier and chlorhexidine was not there before. So if they used spirit, they still want to use spirit … or even using saliva or cow dung.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “The common challenge that we face is that mothers believe in the use of some traditional methods like use of saliva.” (Ruiru_Midwife_6) B. HCW satisfaction with CHX for cord care The preferences that HCWs had for CHX in cord care were varied, largely shaped by their clinical and anecdotal experiences with different methods. Approximately half of the HCWs who expressed satisfaction with CHX did so primarily due to its perceived effectiveness in preventing omphalitis and NNS. This ultimately reduced the need for additional healthcare visits for both mothers and newborns. Many HCWs in favor of CHX also highlighted that it promoted quicker stump healing compared to other methods, provided that mothers followed proper instructions, maintained good hygiene, and began cord care immediately or shortly after birth. Additionally, CHX was praised for being easy to use, contributing to its widespread adoption and positive outcomes. “So far, the outcomes have been good. We have had limited cases of sepsis after the use of chlorhexidine.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “… those who practice, okay, cord care with chlorhexidine as they are instructed, the outcome is good.” (Kihara_Midwife_16) “The use of chlorhexidine for cord care has made work easier in Kiambu since it’s easy to use and its availability, its efficacy being high has made it easier for us to manage the newborns and their mothers are even happy with the healing process using chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) “The effectiveness of cord care is better compared with [traditional or surgical spirit] methods … in comparison with the mothers that have been using the surgical spirit and the cord care, during the postnatal checkup one week post-delivery, the mothers who have been using the chlorhexidine, the cords are healed faster compared with other methods.” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) C. Barriers to CHX adoption and effective use for cord care 1. Systemic barriers One of the most significant barriers to the adoption and provision of CHX for cord care was its inconsistent availability in government health facilities. This challenge of access was twofold: not only was there a shortage of government-supplied CHX to health facilities, and when it was available, its cost often priced consumers out of the market. Many mothers at the facility found the cost of CHX prohibitive. As a result, HCWs recommended more affordable alternatives, which hindered CHX’s widespread adoption and led mothers to choose cheaper options like surgical spirit. “…And then the erratic supplies for the county, particularly because of those financial constraints the counties have been having have made it easy for us to try out other things because in the absence of chlorhexidine, what else was being done to allow cords to heal... the supplies and the county, it’s quite irregular. The stock-outs are very, very, very common because of the budgetary constraints in the county.” (Thika_ Paediatrician _12) “The first challenge is limited resources from the county. That is, when receiving our delivery from KEMSA, we might also be able to receive chlorhexidine. Another challenge is from the patients. Once the drug is prescribed, some patients may not be able to purchase from the pharmacies outside.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_24) “The challenges of provision of chlorhexidine gel, first of all, I’d say it’s not readily available. As in, even if I sent a mother outside here to buy, I don’t think it’s as available as there rest. Secondly, the cost. It’s a challenge because the mothers are not able to afford it” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) 2. Perceived product-specific disadvantages Some HCWs associated CHX use with delayed cord healing, sepsis, and prolonged cord detachment. In a few instances, they reported that neonates had returned to the hospital with infections after its use. Concerns also emerged over the varying CHX formulations, which caused confusion, particularly due to its resemblance to tetracycline eye ointment and challenges in proper application. The drop formulation was especially scrutinized, with some HCWs believing it contributed to sepsis and soft tissue burns. Their perceptions of CHX's effectiveness were largely shaped by mothers’ feedback. These second-hand accounts reinforced the belief that CHX was less effective than other cord care methods, ultimately influencing its use within health facilities. “…The [CHX] drops, the mothers are coming back with septic cords. I don’t know whether it’s the hygiene at home or what. I don’t get. But when we get a mother that comes and then we take the history, they say they bought the drops. But with the gel, no, not much sepsis. But with the drops, there is.” (Kiambu_Midwife_35) “Now, the problem with the gel was that either it was too thick and it kept leaving the cord moist, and so it would take longer for the cord to drop off … So, a lot of children would come with delayed cord dropping.” (Thika_Paediatrician_12) “Initially, we used to use the chlorhexidine gel, which was a bit difficult to use because it required one to wash their hands or change their gloves, apply the gel on their finger, and then spread the gel on the cord and surrounding skin. The gel could also be confused with tetracycline eye ointment because of the kind of packaging it came in. However, with the solution, it's much easier to use because all one needs to do is to drop a few drops on the umbilical cord and leave the baby's cord to dry. The packaging is also very different from the tetracycline eye ointment, so confusion is reduced.” (Kiambu_Paediatrician_36) 3. Inconsistent use instructions The data corpus revealed a significant knowledge gap among HCWs and mothers regarding the use of CHX for cord care, with some indicating that it should be applied once a day but others recommending it twice a day. HCWs often demonstrated preferences for alternative practices, reflecting a reluctance towards the adoption of CHX. These gaps were primarily due to insufficient HCW training on CHX application, leading to a lack of awareness among mothers about proper usage. “… the mothers need an education. There are mothers who will not want to use chlorhexidine gel because of mythical thoughts or superstition, or that’s not what they were taught by their mothers to use. So, sensitization is needed … we need to sensitize the healthcare workers because sometimes we have found mothers who have not used chlorhexidine gel because the physician who was working with the mother did not believe in the working of chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) 4. Inertia Among HCWs, the knowledge gap regarding CHX use is further complicated by resistance to switch from surgical spirit, which many have successfully used in the past. This resistance is often rooted in personal experiences with both products. HCWs tend to favor surgical spirit, largely due to their familiarity with it and the perceived shortcomings of CHX. “I think the fact that most of the healthcare workers were used to surgical spirit, the switch to chlorhexidine and the fact that it takes time, the cord takes time to heal, I think most people are still reluctant to start mothers on the gel. They’ll prefer surgical spirit.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) D. Recommendations to increase CHX uptake HCWs underscored the need for increased awareness and education among both HCWs and patients, citing persistent knowledge gaps regarding CHX’s benefits and proper usage. Many recommended improving accessibility by including CHX in maternity packages or ensuring its consistent availability in hospital pharmacies, thereby enabling timely application immediately after delivery, which is a critical factor for its efficacy. Affordability also emerged as a central concern, with suggestions to reduce the cost of CHX and incorporate it into health insurance schemes such as (formerly) Linda Mama to alleviate the financial burden on mothers. Furthermore, HCWs advocated for comprehensive training programs targeting midwives, doctors, and pediatricians to deepen their understanding of CHX. Such training would enable healthcare providers to more effectively counsel patients, thereby promoting greater uptake of CHX in cord care practices. “Yes. So number one, it’s the cost. It is readily available to them considering that it is covered by NHIF, number one...” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “Suggest that the hospital should source for more of the drug to ensure that it’s constantly available for use to increase its uptake. Interviewer: If it was available, do you think everybody would use. Interviewee: Yeah.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “I think we need proper training for the staff, especially in maternity, even for us working in the postnatal clinics, because I understand the gel should be started immediately after birth.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) “The other one is educating, first of all, the healthcare worker on how to use it so that the healthcare worker is empowered to also educate the mothers on how to use it.” (Thika_Pharmacist_11) E. Opinions on information, education, and communication (IEC) materials IEC materials depicting the application of CHX were found to be largely unavailable and inadequate in healthcare facilities. A significant majority of respondents (86.1%) reported that these materials were inaccessible in most hospital units, resulting in ineffective promotion of CHX utilization. In cases where materials did exist, they were often not suitable for illiterate women, who frequently resorted to traditional methods of cord care. To address this gap, HCWs suggested developing more inclusive IEC materials, such as pictorials and patient-friendly infographics, to ensure that all mothers could benefit from the health education provided. These materials included charts, pictograms, and illustrations that use inclusive language. using accessible language. These patient-friendly IEC materials should be strategically placed in locations such as antenatal clinics and labor wards, so that mothers are informed about the importance of CHX and can prepare to obtain it before delivery. HCWs also recommended tailoring resources specifically for their needs, including physical charts as reminders at workstations, along with Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions and training programs. Observations made by the participants included the following: “But in the facility in Githunguri, I’ve not seen any [IECs]. And I think CME is about the chlorhexidine would really help in creating awareness… everywhere, in every ward, in the postnatal rooms, and in labor ward, and also here in antenatal.” (Githunguri_PNC-nurse_29) “On the issue of IEC materials, they’re not available in our facility. If they can be effective and brought down to the facilities, I would recommend they be more pictorial. By a glance, someone is able to know what it is and how it can be used and the readings big enough to be legible.” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) “The IEC material would help the staff here be at least more conversant for those who are not conversant with chlorhexidine gel, its use, its application, the period which the patient is supposed to use... Through the information the staff acquire, they’ll be able to make more informed decisions of even escalating the matter to facilitate the increase of the supply of the chlorhexidine gel in the facility and also acts a refresher …as opposed to other previous methods that were used of cord care…The IECs are not available at the facility at the moment...” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “For the charts, they should be bigger, and they should provide more charts so that we can put maybe in the wards and to educate the mothers. And for those mothers who are illiterate who cannot read, the wordings are many than the pictures. The pictures are better illustrating of how to use the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27)

Discussion This study explored the experiences of HCWs in Kiambu County regarding newborn cord care and revealed significant deviations from Kenya’s national guidelines which recommends the blanket use of CHX for all neonates nationwide. Despite the increasing adoption of CHX, with 41.7% of HCWs reported transitioning from surgical spirit, outdated and potentially harmful practices such as the use of surgical or methylated spirit persisted in our set-up. One facility in our study, Thika Level 5 Hospital, adopted its own facility-based practice of dry cord care. Our findings suggests that the national policy on CHX has not been fully implemented or embraced in practice, underscoring the need for strengthened policy adherence and education. The participants in this study reported diverse experiences with the use of CHX for cord care. Key concerns included the cost of CHX products, delayed healing, and varying perceptions of its effectiveness. The cost of CHX, which was quoted between Ksh. 120–200 (USD 0.93 to 1.55), was perceived as expensive by some clients, particularly when compared to more affordable alternatives such as methylated spirit (Ksh. 50, USD 0.34) or dry cord care, which incurs no cost. This contrasts with the findings of Opanga et al., who reported that CHX gel was available at less than Ksh 40 in private facilities and pharmacies, and was free in public hospitals, yet with only a minimal uptake of 1.3% [29]. Another study conducted in rural Bungoma county found that CHX was provided free of charge to mothers after delivery, but noted that improper use and misunderstandings regarding its application negatively impacted uptake, along with echoing concerns about delayed cord separation [30]. The variations in participants’ experiences with CHX use in Kiambu County may reflect the unique socio-economic and health system dynamics of a peri-urban area situated near the capital city. While Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi may suggest better access to health information and services, it also presents a complex interplay between urban and rural health-seeking behaviours. Unlike rural Bungoma, where CHX was provided free and uptake issues were mainly due to poor understanding or instructions, Kiambu residents may encounter CHX more frequently through private pharmacies or clinics where it is sold at significantly higher prices, making it prohibitive to lower-income households despite theoretical availability. Furthermore, price discrepancies between public and private sectors may indicate a lack of standardized pricing or public awareness about where to obtain CHX for free. This is supported by the findings of Opanga et al., which noted low uptake despite free availability in public hospitals [29]. This demonstrates a disconnect between policy and implementation, possibly fueled by inadequate dissemination of information, lack of health worker engagement, or supply chain challenges in public facilities. Despite these challenges, our results also highlighted positive feedback from HCWs, particularly around the ease of use, prevention of sepsis, and faster cord separation, suggests potential benefits. This echoes a participant in Opanga et al.‘s study who reported early cord separation, with the cord drying and detaching after just three days, highlighting the promise of CHX in improving neonatal outcomes when used appropriately [29]. The majority of HCWs interviewed indicated challenges in the provision of CHX due to systemic challenges of unavailability. The inclusion of CHX in the Kenya Essential Medicines List was intended to enhance its availability in the public sector, and this highlights a gap in enforcement of this directive in our context [22]. The overarching goal of healthcare systems is to ensure that all patients have consistent access to a comprehensive range of suitable, high-quality, and affordable essential medicines, as emphasized by the WHO [31]. Essential medicines are critical components of healthcare, recognized alongside clean water, safe food supply, and adequate housing as fundamental necessities; their absence constitutes a failure to uphold universal human rights [32,31]. However, essential medicines frequently experience stock-outs in developing countries [32,31]. In Kenya, where health services are devolved (the national government “shares” government functions with smaller county governments), the impact of these stock-outs varies across the different counties. To mitigate the occurrence of stock-outs for essential medications on the package list, it is crucial for public sector facilities to ensure timely payments to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for their orders [33,34]. Conversely, non-public facilities report infrequent stock-outs due to differing and strengthened procurement processes. Stock-outs were also identified as a significant concern by Ambale et al. at Kangundo Hospital [16]. Consequently, participants reported a lack of sustained experience with the products, which undermined their confidence in persuading mothers to purchase them upon leaving the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, to achieve optimal coverage, particularly for economically disadvantaged families, subsidization may be necessary [35]. The aforementioned issue raises a critical discussion about the disconnect between policy and implementation under Kenya’s devolved health system. It highlights that simply listing a drug as essential is not enough without effective supply chain management, accountability structures, and financing mechanisms at the county level. The situation in Kiambu highlights how inconsistent availability of essential medicines like CHX undermines provider confidence, policy adherence, and public trust, all of which contribute to missed opportunities for preventing neonatal infections and deaths. Moreover, the inequity between public and non-public facilities, where the latter have more consistent procurement systems, underscores the urgency of reforming public sector logistics and financing flows: particularly timely disbursement of funds to suppliers. Without these structural changes, the promise of universal health coverage and improved neonatal outcomes will remain unrealized. This discussion also sets the stage for recommending policy enforcement mechanisms, decentralized budgeting reforms, and stronger accountability for county health departments, as essential steps toward resolving persistent stock-outs of life-saving commodities. HCWs reported inadequate training in CHX cord care, leading to significant knowledge gaps and unfamiliarity with recommended guidelines. This resulted in variations in the reported frequency of CHX application. This finding aligns with another Kenyan study, which linked the lack of training and clear instructions to the ineffectiveness of CHX gel [16]. To address research-driven shifts, standardized guidelines for CHX use are essential. Ongoing medical education for all cord care personnel is crucial. Participants also emphasized the need for increased media publicity to enhance consumer knowledge, in line with the sensitization efforts recommended by Opanga et al. [29]. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 89.2% of births in Kiambu County occurred in hospitals, with 98% of these deliveries attended by medical professionals [36]. This rate is notably higher than the 54% and 64% reported in Pemba (Tanzania) and Zambia, respectively [37,38]. However, having a medically assisted delivery does not necessarily guarantee a reduced risk of infection, as many medical centers in our context fail to meet minimal infection prevention standards [39]. Furthermore, potentially hazardous procedures that raise concerns in home delivery settings are often performed on women and infants before they are discharged within hours of birth [15]. While Kiambu’s high institutional delivery rate might suggest optimal conditions for newborn cord care, this can create a false sense of security if not paired with stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. It challenges the assumption that health facility births inherently reduce neonatal infections and points to the critical role of CHX as a safeguard, even within supposedly safer environments. This further reinforces the WHO’s position on universal CHX application, emphasizing that the presence of a skilled birth attendant does not automatically equate to safe neonatal outcomes: especially in under-resourced or overstretched facilities. Integrating CHX as a routine part of postnatal care, regardless of delivery setting, can act as a simple, cost-effective buffer against systemic IPC failures, especially in high-volume facilities that discharge mothers and newborns within hours of delivery. Most HCWs in our study suggested several strategies to enhance the uptake of CHX. IEC is crucial for ensuring correct usage, infection control, patient safety, and adherence to best practices. Participants emphasized the importance of recommending CHX to mothers and providing education on its proper use. These sentiments are echoed in the existing literature as this resistance to CHX has been previously described in similar settings [13,30,40–42]. Both the quantity and quality of IEC materials on CHX need improvement. Visual aids and illustrations should be prioritized over text to enhance mothers’ understanding of proper CHX use. Our study found that, while most health facilities had some IEC materials on CHX, these resources were limited and lacked engaging illustrations to support learning. This finding aligns with those of the Bungoma County study [30], and further highlights a pressing need to improve these materials for HCWs. While participants rightly identified the aforementioned methods as key to increasing CHX uptake, these strategies cannot succeed without a robust and context-sensitive health communication framework. The limited, often text-heavy IEC materials reported in this study reveal a missed opportunity to engage mothers, many of whom may have low health literacy or limited formal education, in ways that resonate with their daily realities. This challenge calls for a shift from generic IEC content to co-designed, visual, and language-appropriate tools that accommodate all literacy levels. Devolution in Kenya offers both a challenge and an opportunity: counties like Kiambu can tailor CHX strategies to their unique population needs, but this must be done in alignment with national guidelines and messaging, to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. This requires capacity-building for local health workers, investment in community engagement strategies, and partnerships with trusted media outlets to amplify accurate, culturally resonant messages on CHX use. Ultimately, the effectiveness of CHX as a public health intervention depends not just on availability, but on how well it is communicated, understood, and trusted at the community level.

Conclusion The mixed perceptions, inconsistent use of CHX for cord care and the use of alternative cord care methods in Kiambu County reveal a deeper systemic issue that extends beyond individual preferences: it points to critical gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health communication. The fact that one of the facilities included in our study practice cord care contrary to national guidelines is particularly concerning and highlights a lack of oversight and accountability in guideline implementation. To ensure CHX fulfills its potential as a low-cost, high-impact intervention for preventing neonatal infections, there is an urgent need for policy action at both county and national levels. This includes: (1) strengthening the enforcement of national neonatal care protocols across all facilities, (2) ensuring uninterrupted availability of CHX through timely procurement and subsidization, and (3) developing and disseminating culturally appropriate, visually driven IEC materials to improve community understanding and uptake. As Kenya advances toward Universal Health Coverage, it is imperative that essential medicines like CHX are not only listed on paper but made reliably available and appropriately used at the point of care. A unified, well-supported CHX strategy will not only align with WHO recommendations but also directly contribute to reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality: especially among the most vulnerable populations. This must begin with aligning policy intent with health system practice.

The imposition of sweeping tariffs against all African economies, large and small —should they last—will only make African livelihoods more precarious.

The Trump administration’s first 100 days in power signaled a sharp and dramatic reorientation of the U.S. relationship with Africa. Public health forecasting models estimate that the administration’s grave cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief will result in 26 million additional HIV infections, 15 million preventable AIDS deaths, and 14 million more children orphaned by AIDS by 2040, with more than 60 percent of these impacts concentrated in only six African countries.

The imposition of sweeping tariffs against all African economies, large and small—should they last—will only make African livelihoods more precarious.

Beyond the cuts to aid and trade, a steady stream of leaked predecisional documents portend a deeper U.S. retreat from engagement in Africa. On March 14, the New York Times and other media outlets reported on a draft “travel ban” that would impose more stringent travel requirements on 43 countries, 22 of which are African. Four days later, NBC News reviewed internal Defense Department proposals that would result in the elimination of the U.S. Africa Command (Africom) as an independent geographic combatant command of the Pentagon.

In mid-April, African headlines were dominated by a leaked draft executive order that would close embassies across the continent and perhaps even completely eliminate the Bureau of African Affairs, which oversees U.S. relations with 49 countries. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent announcement of his department’s reorganization plans indicated that the Africa bureau will remain in place for now, but it offered little clarity on the broader strategic vision for U.S. engagement with the continent.

Though perhaps too early to tell, the Trump administration’s foreign policy toward Africa shows clear signs of being driven by transactionalism. Through this lens, Africa is not likely to be judged by its long-term potential or the future strategic risks of disengagement. Instead, under the “America First” approach, relationships are likely to be measured by their immediate benefits and the potential to offer tangible, clear, and easily messaged “wins” that show a return on investment to U.S. audiences.

This approach means that partnerships and interests will become increasingly conditional. Whether via security cooperation or economic investment, U.S. policy toward Africa is unlikely to be framed as part of a broader global effort to protect the rules-based international order, promote democratic norms, or advance development and human rights. Many African states, especially those facing internal instability or lacking the capacity to reciprocate in strategic or economic terms, are likely to find themselves on the outside looking in.

But instead of retreating from Africa, the Trump administration should embrace a smarter form of transactionalism. U.S.-Africa policy can still prioritize tangible returns, but those returns should come through investments that build enduring partnerships, not through quick exits or short- or one-sided gains. Those may seem seductive, but they risk strategically crippling the United States at the exact moment when adversaries are looking to capitalize.

To do so, U.S. policy toward Africa should refocus around four strategic priorities: supporting resilient and self-sufficient regional organizations; curbing threats to U.S. security at their source; fostering African support for U.S. positions in international institutions; and co-developing a positive economic vision for the continent that promotes economic development and integration while resisting the extractive and abusive economic practices of rival global powers.

Pursuing this approach would preserve an “America First” strategy while respecting an “Africa First” vision built on partnerships, not dependency.

When President George W. Bush went on a five-nation tour of the continent in 2008, he claimed that rather than establish a significant military presence around the continent, the mission of the new U.S. Africa Command would be to “help African leaders solve the continent’s crises.” Today, African states remain plagued by enduring conflicts in several regional conflict zones, but important Africa-led, U.S.-supported security cooperation efforts have been successful and provided valuable lessons for further investments around the continent.

In the Gulf of Guinea, for example—a comprehensive interagency approach involving the U.S. departments of Defense and State, USAID, the Coast Guard, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among other agencies—has contributed to a robust regional maritime security architecture. With U.S. and other international support, African states and regional security institutions have been the primary designers and implementers of new frameworks for coordinating regional efforts to combat piracy, trafficking, fisheries crimes, and other maritime threats.

Significant security gains have been made in the gulf, including a roughly 90percent drop in piracy and armed robbery incidents between 2020 and 2024, despite Washington and other international partners having a minimal military footprint in the region. Effectively, this Africa-led, U.S.-supported effort has improved so-called security burden-sharing with African partners and allowed the United States to allocate more resources and attention to counterterrorism, an outcome that is certainly in line with the Trump administration’s “America First” priorities.

Successes such as the Gulf of Guinea security architecture should shape future U.S. efforts to support African-led solutions. Organizations including the African Union and Africa Standby Force, alongside regional economic communities such as the Economic Community of West African States and Southern African Development Community, are critical actors for intracontinental relationships. These organizations have played essential roles ranging from economic cooperation to crisis response and prevention. Washington’s Africa policy should focus on providing support and expertise to these initiatives.

Critics of increased U.S. engagement in Africa are sometimes eager to criticize Washington for dominating responses to supposedly African problems, but this critique ignores the transnational nature of the continent’s most pressing security challenges. Problems such as civil war, terrorism, military rule, public health crises, and black-market economies will not be solved without African leadership—but these problems, if left unchecked, will undermine U.S. security whether or not Washington chooses to remain engaged.

Consider the global drug trade and the Trump administration’s clear concern over narcotics trafficking. Parts of Africa have been integral nodes in the global drug trade—particularly in West Africa, which has historically served as a key transit hub and corridor for narcotics trafficking to Europe and beyond. But there is no reason that this threat will remain confined to Europe as criminal syndicates evolve, mature, and expand.

The Sahel region’s deteriorating security situation, brought on by an intricate web of terrorism, domestic conflict, coups, and corruption, has also raised alarms among analysts who warn of an emerging nexus between organized crime and violent extremist groups. There is a real risk of the region evolving into a hub of narco-terrorism where al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates benefit.

In addition, migrant smuggling and trafficking has remained a persistent issue around the continent and has shown no signs of slowing down. Europe’s efforts to quell and crack down on migration flows through North Africa have pushed many migrants to pursue alternative destinations. Thousands of African migrants, for instance, have opted to make the trek to the United States, often via routes leading to the U.S. southern border with Mexico.

And as the COVID-19 pandemic showed, disease outbreaks do not respect geography. The best defense comes from proactive engagement to develop resilient health systems—not reactionary policies. Reconsidering aid cuts and investing in early detection, rapid response capabilities, and basic public health infrastructure in Africa is a smart investment..

Addressing these problems closer to their source, through targeted and selective engagement, can advance U.S. security while minimizing the need for costly interventions later.

Despite the Trump administration’s skepticism toward international institutions, organizations such as the United Nations remain essential arenas for advancing U.S. strategic interests. China and Russia use the U.N. and other intergovernmental bodies to win favor for their actions, legitimize their views of a post-U.S. global order, and amplify their narratives. They also recognize the importance of African votes, as they form a voting bloc of more than a quarter of the world’s sovereign states.

Africa represents the largest regional voting bloc in the United Nations General Assembly, with 54 member states. That gives African countries significant collective influence. That influence is seen in the bloc’s voting behavior over the war in Ukraine. In a General Assembly vote condemning Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, African countries accounted for nearly half of all abstentions. Later, some countries that have grown increasingly close to Moscow (e.g., Mali), shifted their voting on Ukrainian issues in favor of Russia.

Beijing and Moscow are only likely to increase their diplomatic onslaughts at the U.N. in an effort to win friends and allies in addition to courting partners via African leaders’ summits. If the United States continues to treat Africa as a peripheral interest while strategic adversaries do not, its indifference risks being reciprocated in international institutions.

Trump’s first term saw the establishment of the “Prosper Africa” program, an effort aimed to boost U.S.-Africa trade through increased private sector investment across the continent. The initiative was designed to align with the America First approach by opening African markets to U.S. businesses—it was a way of positioning the United States as an economic counterweight to China.

It was also heralded as an important pivot away from simply delivering development aid or humanitarian assistance, which had come to define U.S.-Africa relations. Foundationally, the program’s design aligns with the transactional approach that is likely to define the Trump administration’s Africa policy this time around. But the status and future of that program, which was primarily housed under USAID, is unclear.

Moreover, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), enacted in 2000, has given more than 30 African states access to U.S. markets without import tariffs for certain products. The payoffs have been significant for several African states. For instance, Deutsche Welle reported that under the program, Kenya’s apparel exports to the United States grew from $55 million in 2001 to $603 million in 2022, comprising nearly 68 percent of Kenya’s total exports to the United States.

Despite such successes, the Trump administration’s preferences for tariffs as a bargaining tool suggest that AGOA is unlikely to be renewed when it expires in September. Letting this legislation lapse would not only damage bilateral economic ties and create opportunities for China to consolidate its trade dominance, but would also undercut the value of long-term economic partnerships.

Arguments about the geostrategic importance of Africa are not new, and talking points about future economic potential, rapid population growth, strategic geographic positioning along vital sea lanes, and deposits of critical mineral resources have been echoed for decades. This belief in the long-term strategic value of the continent is exactly what motivated the creation of Africom nearly 20 years ago and inspired the Biden administration’s “Africa Strategy” in 2022.

Even as the new administration shifts the focus to short-term transactionalism, this is not the time to turn away from strategic priorities in Africa. Retreating from the continent risks sending signals of unreliability at a time when credibility and commitment are precious commodities. Pursuing these four objectives would provide Washington the opportunity to realize tangible, near-term gains that are mutually beneficial. They would also reduce the costs that would surely arise for any future intervention and would improve prospects for support of U.S. priorities globally while blunting the influence of China and Russia.

Through commitment, not retrenchment, the Trump administration can protect U.S. interests, reinforce American leadership, and secure tangible returns on investment in a region whose global significance is only set to grow.

Therefore, completion of all doses is crucial for achieving the best possible immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1–3 years in urban Dhaka. In 2018, according to the immunization card records or histories from parents/guardians, we sorted1–3-year-old children from areas of Dhaka South City Corporation who were not fully immunized. Immunization records were obtained from the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) card or maternal recall. Reasons for non-vaccination were documented. A total of 501 children were tracked down to determine the causes of their incomplete polio doses. Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities were assessed by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model. The households with a child who had not received all the recommended vaccines had a considerably lower monthly income (18,000 BDT; p < 0.001). In both the complete and partial vaccination groups, the average family size was five people, and the average child age was 28 months. Education level of the household head after adjustment (AOR), the odds of the event occurring decrease by 25% with primary education (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), p-value: < 0.001). Occupation of the household head for rickshaw/van/cart puller, AOR, the odds increase even more, with the event being 3.15 times more likely for this occupation (95% CI: 1.95, 5.08) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Again, for daily wager AOR, 2.16 times higher for daily wagers (95% CI: 1.35, 3.45) and statistical significance (p-value: 0.001). This study identifies sociodemographic factors that influence incomplete childhood immunization in this urban area of Dhaka. In order to improve the coverage, the identified factors need to be mitigated and policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services.

Introduction Immunization involves administering vaccines to achieve immunity against infectious agents and prevent related diseases [1]. Childhood immunization is the safest method to protect against life-threatening diseases like polio and is recognized as the most effective and economical intervention to reduce childhood mortality and morbidity [2,3]. In 2018, an estimated 700,000 children under five died from vaccine-preventable diseases, mostly in low- and middle-income countries [4,5]. To meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, all countries must reduce newborn deaths to at least 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least 25 per 1,000 live births. The World Health Organization (WHO)‘s Immunization Agenda 2030 aims to ensure all children receive recommended vaccines regardless of location, age, socioeconomic status, or gender [6]. The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), established in 1974 with WHO support [3,7] provides basic vaccines globally. Immunization currently prevents 2–3 million deaths annually [8], with an additional 1.5 million deaths preventable by expanding global vaccination coverage. Bangladesh’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) adheres to the vaccine schedule recommended by the WHO is BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) at birth, Penta (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenza type b) and OPV (oral polio vaccine), two doses of fIPV (fractional-dose inactivated polio vaccine) at 6 and 14 weeks of age. PCV (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) in three doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, followed by measles vaccine (MR) at 9 and 15 months [9]. Despite progress, many children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remain unvaccinated [7]. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) predict that 1.5 million children suffer each year from vaccine-preventable diseases due to low vaccination coverage [10]. Even though childhood immunizations are one of the most effective disease prevention strategies globally, vaccine hesitancy has always influenced uptake and effectiveness [11–13]. Reasons related to religion and culture [14–16] challenges, and opinions of parents/guardians who reject or partially accept childhood immunizations, such as vaccine safety and lengthy vaccine repercussions, have been reported [17–20]. Some of the parents have strong belief that, children gets too many vaccines at once, can’t prevent them from getting infected or feels that it will hamper natural growth. [21,22]. Compared to other South Asian countries, the vaccination coverage for children is the highest in Bangladesh [23]. Though, it is found that full immunization coverage among children aged 12–35 months was 86.17% in 2011, 85.13% in 2014, and 89.23% in 2017–18 [24]. Childhood vaccination prevents roughly 200,000 deaths in Bangladesh each year despite the noteworthy success. Bangladesh is on the list of the top ten countries with the highest childhood mortality globally [7,25]. The vaccinated person’s immune response depends on the type of vaccine used, the number of doses given, and if the person has already been vaccinated against the disease. Bangladesh’s efforts to reduce child mortality have relied heavily on the EPI services. Therefore, to achieve the health-related SDG, especially the target of reducing preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children by 2030, it is crucial to expand the coverage of vaccination of children. More than 50 million deaths can be averted through childhood immunization [26]. Several studies have explored immunization coverage in Bangladesh, few have focused on the urban context particularly the determinants of incomplete immunization and missed opportunities among children in densely populated urban areas like Dhaka. Urban-specific barriers such as high population mobility, informal settlements, and health system fragmentation are often underrepresented in the literature. Our study addresses this gap by investigating these unique challenges in an urban setting, thereby contributing evidence to guide targeted interventions. So, the objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1–3 years in urban Dhaka. Understanding the key factors influencing childhood vaccination is crucial for developing strategies to enhance vaccination coverage and reduce child mortality and morbidity.

Materials and methods Ethics Statement The protocol was approved by the Research Review Committee (RRC) and Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the children. However, we did a secondary analysis of the data. Study site The study was conducted in the southern city corporation urban slum areas of Dhaka city, Bangladesh, which included wards 14, 22, 34, 55, 56, 57 in Rayerbazar, Hazaribagh, and Kamrangirchar. These areas were densely populated and characterized by urban slums and considerable infrastructure is available to support the study. The study area has an aggregate population of approximately 300,000 persons, where there is a high population density (3.4 persons per room). Access to piped water is high (96% of households) but the quality of water is suspect due to breakdown of underground pipes, and to frequent lapses in water pressure leading to contamination of piped water by nearby sewage pipes, which also are ridden with leaks. About 81% of households have access to improved sanitation, but dense crowding makes proper management of solid waste very difficult. As well, the population has demonstrably low levels of knowledge about proper personal and food hygiene, and makes little personal investment in such hygiene. So, represent densely populated urban settings with a high concentration of low-income households, informal settlements, and variable access to healthcare services factors known to influence immunization coverage. Study design and data collection The original study was conducted following a randomized controlled trial that was conducted among healthy children aged 1–3 years who had previously received no more than one dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and had not received any doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) or oral cholera vaccine prior to enrollment. The original sample size was calculated based on the hypothesis that the immune response to bOPV and Oral Cholera Vaccine administered simultaneously is non-inferior to the immune response when administered individually. Specifically, for poliovirus types 1 and 3, we assumed a 50% seroconversion rate, a non-inferiority margin of 15%, a significance level of 5%, and a study power of 85%. Based on these parameters, we estimated that 173 participants would be needed in each of the three groups. To account for a 10% attrition rate, the total enrollment target was set at 579 children who had received either no or one dose of bOPV [27]. However, for this secondary analysis, which focuses on immunization coverage and determinants, we included only participants with complete and verified data. Due to loss to follow-up and missing outcome variables, the final analytic sample comprised 501 children. Eligible children were enrolled after obtaining written informed consent from their caretakers followed them for one year of enrolment. The eligible children were invited to the study field office and enrolment was started from May 11, 2018 and follow-up completed on 27 August, 2019. During the study, we collected the immunization records from the participants either from the EPI cards or history from the parents/guardians. We prioritized verification through the child’s EPI card whenever available. In cases where the EPI card was not present, maternal recall was used with careful probing and cross-checking against the standard vaccination schedule to improve accuracy. Reasons for non-vaccination were also documented. The questionnaire was adapted from standardized tools previously used in immunization coverage surveys in Bangladesh and was reviewed by public health experts for content validity. Prior to the main data collection, the tool was revised accordingly. Additionally, all interviewers received intensive training on the questionnaire content, interview techniques, and ethical considerations to ensure consistency and minimize interviewer bias. Operational definitions used in this analysis In Bangladesh, the standard polio virus vaccination schedule includes bivalent OPV (bOPV) at birth and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, with IPV (containing all three serotypes) administered intramuscularly at 14 weeks of age. We used the following definitions for this analysis. Complete vaccination:. A child who received the following vaccines within 15 months of age. One dose of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), three doses each of the DPT-HepB-Hib (pentavalent) vaccine, three doses of OPV, two doses of IPV, three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), and two doses of the measles-rubella vaccine. Incomplete vaccination:. A child aged 1–3 years who missed at least one dose of the OPV vaccines was considered incompletely vaccinated in this study. There is no known cure for polio; vaccination, primarily with live-attenuated OPVs, remains the single, most effective preventive and control strategy. We used Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) status as the primary indicator due to its multi-dose requirement and the observed tendency for dropouts between successive doses in previous studies. OPV coverage serves as a sensitive marker for identifying missed opportunities and service delivery gaps. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the study participants. Frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were computed for continuous variables. Significance of the associations and the difference between groups were measured using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. To identify determinants of incomplete vaccination, bivariate analyses were initially conducted using logistic regression model. Variables with a p-value < 0.20 in the bivariate analysis were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to control for potential confounders. Crude odds ratios (COR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured by exponentiating the coefficients of the model and reported to assess the strength of associations. The reasons for zero dose and one dose of vaccination were also explored with number and percentage and compared by using Fisher exact test with Monte Carlo simulation to compute the p value for the large table. R version 4.4.2 was used for all the statistical analysis and MS Excel 2019 was used to generate the figures. We conducted a complete case analysis, excluding observations with missing values for key variables from the final regression models. The proportion of missing data was low and not systematically related to the outcome or exposure variables, minimizing the risk of bias. The child’s age, sex, household education, household income, and occupation. variables were selected based on prior literature and their theoretical and empirical associations with immunization status. Including these covariates allowed us to adjust for potential confounding and isolate the independent effects of key predictors.

Discussion Immunization is a cornerstone of public health, significantly contributing to the reduction of childhood mortality rates. Our study sheds light on the factors influencing incomplete immunization in children aged 1–3 years in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, particularly focusing on the oral polio vaccine (OPV). A major finding of our study is the correlation between household income and vaccination status. Households with a monthly income of less than 18,000 BDT were significantly more likely to have children with incomplete vaccinations. This finding is consistent with a study conducted in Nepal, where lower socioeconomic status was associated with reduced access to vaccinations [28]. Similarly, a study in Pakistan found that families with higher income levels were more likely to have fully vaccinated children, suggesting that economic constraints can impede timely access to healthcare services [29]. The economic burden on lower-income families may lead to prioritizing immediate needs over preventive healthcare measures, such as vaccinations. Moreover, our research identified that larger family size was associated with a higher likelihood of incomplete vaccinations, with families having more members being more likely to miss vaccinations. This observation resonates with findings from a study in rural Bangladesh, which reported that larger household sizes often lead to resource allocation challenges, thereby negatively impacting children’s health outcomes [30]. In larger families, the attention and resources for healthcare may become difficult which contributing to missed vaccination opportunities. The role of the household head’s education level emerged as another critical factor influencing vaccination status. Children whose household heads had attained primary or secondary education were less likely to be incompletely vaccinated compared to those with uneducated heads of households. This finding aligns with global evidence showing that maternal and paternal education significantly impacts child health behaviors, including vaccination uptake [31]. Educated parents are often more aware of the importance of immunization and may seek healthcare services more diligently, thereby ensuring timely vaccinations for their children. Our study also found that children with female household heads had higher likelihood of receiving incomplete vaccinations. This finding echoes the results of a study in India, where children from female-headed households were found to have lower vaccination coverage due to societal and cultural barriers [32]. Female-headed households may face additional challenges in accessing healthcare services due to prevailing gender norms and limited autonomy in decision-making regarding children’s health. The qualitative data collected from parents regarding the reasons for incomplete OPV vaccination further illustrate the complexities of vaccination uptake. A notable parent reported that their child was sick at the time of vaccination, indicating a missed opportunity due to health concerns. This aligns with findings from a study in Nigeria, which found that parental perceptions of a child’s health significantly influenced vaccination decisions [33]. Additionally, logistical barriers such as inconvenience of time and unavailability of vaccination cards were commonly reported, suggesting that improving the accessibility and convenience of vaccination services could enhance uptake. The influence of misinformation and vaccine hesitancy also surfaced in our study. Vaccine hesitancy has been increasingly recognized as a barrier to immunization worldwide. A systematic review highlighted that misinformation about vaccines often spreads through community networks, influencing parents’ decisions and leading to decreased vaccination coverage [34]. Addressing these misconceptions through targeted community engagement and education could play a crucial role in improving vaccination rates. Furthermore, logistical challenges such as long distances to vaccination centers and busy schedules were highlighted as barriers. A study in Kenya reported similar findings, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions, such as mobile vaccination units, to reach underserved populations [35]. Improving access to vaccination services, especially in urban settings where transportation can be challenging, may reduce missed opportunities. Research in Pakistan identified several key factors affecting whether children completed their immunizations, including where they were delivered, their gender, and their mother’s education level and region of residence [36]. Children were less likely to have incomplete immunizations if their mothers were educated or if they were delivered at a health facility. In addition, girls were more likely to be incompletely immunized compared to boys. Similarly, studies in India found that maternal education, socioeconomic status, gender, and place of delivery were significant predictors of incomplete immunization [37]. Furthermore, a 2016 study in Nepal showed that 78.2% of children were fully immunized, while 21% were under-immunized, and 0.8% were un-immunized. Possessing an immunization card was strongly linked to being fully immunized, and children whose mothers had education beyond secondary school or were employed had higher odds of being fully immunized [38]. This study has several limitations because most of the sample comprise children from low socio-economic from a single peri urban area capture factors related with the supply of vaccine for childhood immunization. However, a formal trend analysis using time-series methods (e.g., linear regression) was not feasible due to differences in data granularity and time intervals. The national immunization data are aggregated annually and may not align with the more detailed, sub-annual or campaign-specific data collected in the study area. Additionally, the study area experienced unique intervention timelines and local contextual factors that differ from national programmatic efforts, limiting the validity of direct statistical comparisons. Recall bias as vaccination status was partly self-reported by caregivers, there is a risk of over- or under-reporting, especially in the absence of vaccination cards. Generalizability; since the study was conducted in an urban setting, the findings may not be directly applicable to rural areas where healthcare access, infrastructure, and socio-cultural dynamics differ significantly. Selection bias; while we employed systematic recruitment procedures, individuals who participated may differ from those who did not, potentially influencing the representativeness of our sample. We suggest that urban immunization programs can reduce missed opportunities by integrating vaccination services into routine outpatient and child health visits, improving provider training on checking vaccination status, and utilizing digital reminder systems. Additionally, we highlight the importance of targeted outreach programs such as mobile clinics and community health worker engagement in underserved urban areas to increase accessibility and address vaccine hesitancy.

Conclusion Our study revealed that sociodemographic factors, including household income, family size, education level of household heads and the gender of the household head significantly influenced the immunization status of children in urban Dhaka. These findings emphasized the necessity for tailored interventions that consider these needs for targeted interventions that address these determinants to improve vaccination coverage. Policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation, and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services. By implementing this so, we can contribute to achieve the global goal of reducing childhood mortality and morbidity associated with vaccine-preventable diseases.

The government has proposed an allocation of Ksh138.1 billion to the health sector in the 2025/2026 financial year, marking a renewed push to strengthen healthcare systems and access.

Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, while addressing the National Assembly on Thursday, June 12, 2025, said the proposed health allocation has risen from Ks123 billion in the previous year, with a strong focus on expanding primary healthcare, vaccinations, and support for vulnerable groups.

“Access to quality and affordable healthcare through the Universal Health Coverage programme is central to this government,” Mbadi said.

“I have proposed an allocation of Ksh138.1 billion to the health sector to support various activities and programmes.”

Key allocations highlighted

The allocation includes Ksh6.2 billion for UHC coordination and management and Ksh13.1 billion for primary healthcare, a notable increase from the Ksh7.1 billion set aside in the current financial year.

Additionally, Ksh430 million has been earmarked to provide medical cover for orphans, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.

“This includes Ksh6.2 billion for Universal Health Coverage coordination and management, Ksh13.1 billion for primary healthcare, up from Ksh7.1 billion in the current year, and Ksh430 million to provide medical cover for orphans, elderly, and disabled persons in our society,” Mbadi told MPs.

To boost Kenya’s disease response efforts, Mbadi proposed KSh 17.3 billion for the Global Fund and KSh 4.6 billion for vaccines and immunization programmes.

“I have proposed Ksh17.3 billion for the Global Fund and Ksh 4.6 billion for vaccines and immunization.”

Reversal after previous cuts

Mbadi’s proposal follows years of cuts in health sector funding. In the 2024/25 budget, his predecessor, CS Njuguna Ndung’u, had allocated Ksh127 billion, down from Ksh141.2 billion in 2023/24 and Ksh146.8 billion in 2022/23.

That trend sparked concern over Kenya’s failure to meet the Abuja Declaration target of allocating at least 15% of the national budget to health.

In last year’s budget, the government proposed Ksh42 billion for UHC, Ksh 2 billion for free maternity healthcare, and Ksh4.6 billion for specialised equipment and stipends for community health promoters.

Further allocations included Ksh28.7 billion to the Global Fund, Ksh4.6 billion for vaccines, and Ksh861.5 million for medical cover for vulnerable groups.

National referral hospitals like KNH and Moi Teaching and Referral received Ksh29.7 billion combined.

Mbadi reaffirms health focus

Mbadi said the renewed investment was necessary to address historical underfunding and improve service delivery across the country.

“We remain committed to building a health system that protects every Kenyan, especially the most vulnerable,” he told Parliament.

If approved, the new budget will mark a reversal of the recent downward trend and reinforce the government’s health priorities heading into the 2025/2026 financial year.

“3 million doses of Bacille Calmette‑Guérin (BCG) vaccine arrived at JKIA, received by PS for Medical Services alongside officials from the Ministry of Health, Kenya, the World Health Organisation, Kenya and the United Nations Children’s Fund,” the World Health Organisation confirmed.

BCG vaccines received and set for distribution

The vaccines came in as the World Health Organisation set to begin their nationwide campaign to protect newborns against TB and close immunity gaps.

This came after a national crisis, as Kenya experienced a countrywide stockout of vaccines and antigens.

As of Friday, June 6, 2025, the Kenyan Ministry of Health issued a press statement revealing a critical shortage in vaccine stocks, with 12 out of 47 counties completely depleted.

“We currently maintain a one-month supply of the rotavirus vaccine and are diligently overseeing the situation. Our commitment is to reassure Kenyans that every feasible measure will be taken to safeguard us against vaccine-preventable illnesses. “Said Dr. Ouma Oluga.

Response to the vaccine shortage

In response, the Ministry promised to redistribute available stocks and collaborate with county governments to ensure equitable access.

“Strategies including tracking vaccine consumption and facilitating redistribution between counties to mitigate stock-out situations will be employed,” the ministry assured.

“Working closely with UNICEF to accelerate the delivery of ordered vaccines and allocating funds for urgent procurement.”

Duale also said that the Chinese government will engage Kenya in 20 annual exchange programmes meant to enhance the training of students in the local health sector.

In a statement on Monday, June 9, the Health CS said the initiatives will be fundamental in securing a solid future for the country's health leadership, in addition to reinforcing the overall capacity of the healthcare workforce.

However, the minister has not explained when the programmes are expected to start and how those eligible can apply for them.

The CS made the announcement after a meeting with a Chinese delegation led by Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Guo Haiyan on Monday. The meeting discussed how the two governments can collaborate even as Kenya seeks to streamline its healthcare system.

""Underscoring the project as a gateway for deeper collaboration, the Cabinet Secretary welcomed China’s offer of 500 scholarships and 20 annual health exchange programmes as a key investment in Kenya’s future health leadership,"" the CS said.

The ministry has further revealed that the Chinese government has been at the vanguard in providing support and training to healthcare workers across the country.

Additionally, the ministry claims that the two governments are considering establishing a Kenya–China Health Cooperation Taskforce that will monitor the progress and the rollout of the Social Health Authority (SHA).

""Briefing the delegation on Kenya’s ongoing health sector reforms, particularly the SHA Duale, proposed the establishment of a Kenya–China Health Cooperation Taskforce to harmonise priorities, fast-track MoUs, and monitor progress,"" the ministry said.

""He also commended China’s ongoing support through technology firms like Huawei, which have been instrumental in equipping rural health facilities and training thousands of health workers,"" it added.

The ministry further claims that the two governments are set to collaborate in the establishment of local vaccine and pharmaceutical production hubs that will be equipped with Chinese technology.

The hubs, which are expected to be complete by 2028, will play a key role in strengthening the country's supply chains, reducing import dependency, and creating employment, according to the ministry.

""The USD 500 million transformative joint initiative seeks to strengthen Kenya’s supply chains, reduce import dependency, create employment in line with the government’s development agenda, and position Kenya as a continental leader in health product manufacturing—a vision expected to become a reality by 2028 with support from the Chinese government,"" the ministry stated.

The establishment of the hubs comes days after the ministry, in a statement on Friday, June 6, announced the arrival of Polio and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccines that were meant to address the vaccine shortage healthcare facilities in the country are currently experiencing.

""The Ministry is actively redistributing available vaccine stocks in collaboration with the County Government to ensure equitable access to all Kenyans in all regions,"" the statement by the Principal Secretary, State Department for Medical Services, Ouma Oluga, read."

In a press statement released Friday, June 6, the Principal Secretary for Medical Services, Dr. Ouma Oluga, revealed that the country’s vaccine stocks for BCG (Tuberculosis) and Polio are down to just two weeks, while Rotavirus vaccine supplies may only last a month if immediate interventions are not made.

“We acknowledge the challenges currently facing vaccine stock levels and immunization efforts across the country,” said Dr. Oluga. “However, no child will miss a single dose of any vaccine, thanks to the Zero-Dose Catch-Up Mechanism.”

The PS attributed the shortfall to global vaccine supply bottlenecks — a challenge affecting not only Kenya but several countries worldwide.

Despite the worrying statistics, the Ministry has activated an emergency redistribution plan in collaboration with County Governments to ensure vaccine access is not interrupted. Frontline health facilities are being prioritized, especially in the 12 counties hit hardest by the shortage.

RELIEF ON THE HORIZON

The Ministry is already taking bold steps to replenish vaccine stocks:

3.2 million doses of Polio vaccine are currently being cleared at the port and will be distributed nationwide by June 10th.

3.0 million doses of BCG vaccine are expected to arrive and be dispatched by June 15th.

Further, the Ministry is establishing a Strategic Vaccine Reserve in all 47 counties, which will be sustainably financed to buffer against future disruptions.

“We appreciate the ongoing cooperation of County Governments and healthcare facilities in managing this situation,” added Dr. Oluga.

ZERO-DOSE-CATCH-UP INITIATIVE

Central to the Ministry’s response is the Zero-Dose Catch-Up Mechanism, a national program under the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), which ensures that children who miss routine vaccinations due to shortages will be promptly reached once supplies are restored.

PUBLIC REASSURANCE

While anxiety over the stock situation grows among parents and healthcare workers, the Ministry has appealed for calm and trust in the system.

“The health and well-being of all Kenyans remains our top priority,” said Dr. Oluga. “We are doing everything in our power to stabilize the situation and restore full vaccine coverage swiftly.”"

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Design and build quality

IDG / Chris Hoffman

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1’s design feels similar to other Lenovo Yoga machines I’ve used in the past year or so. This Yoga laptop uses “Cosmic Blue,” in contrast to Lenovo’s ThinkPad line, which opts for a business look with more shades of gray. Combined with the rounded edges and glossy high-resolution OLED screen, it’s a sleek experience. The blue is rather dark, though. In real life, it looks a lot closer to black than you might expect while catching light in an intriguing way.

The top and bottom are made of aluminum, and the build quality is solid — this is a proven Yoga design, and it’s not Lenovo’s first time putting out a machine in a chassis like this one. It looks very similar to the Lenovo Yoga 9i (Gen 9), for example. The hinge works well. The hinge also has what Lenovo calls a “rotating soundbar” built into it.

There’s no flex that shouldn’t be there, no undesired movement of the display as you type, or anything else you wouldn’t want to see on a machine like this. The design just works like it should. At 2.91 pounds, it’s a standard weight for a laptop like this one — not too heavy and not unusually light.

The built-in software is a little more cluttered than I’d like: it’s got McAfee antivirus popping up and asking you to subscribe out of the box, for example. Consumer laptops tend to have more bundled offers than business laptops, but it feels a little much for a $1,749 laptop. Still, that doesn’t matter at all when you can quickly uninstall it.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Keyboard, trackpad, pen

IDG / Chris Hoffman

The keyboard feels fine to type on. Lenovo says it has “soft-landing” switches, which the company describes as having a “snappy” feel, along with 1.5mm of key travel. It’s not mushy, and the switches feel good to type on for a lightweight portable laptop.

Once again, I have a criticism to make about a Yoga keyboard’s layout. Lenovo has put the fingerprint reader at the bottom right corner of the laptop. Personally, my fingers naturally gravitate towards the bottom-right corner of the keyboard, anticipating the presence of the right arrow key there, which disrupts my muscle memory! And, on the ThinkPad X1 2-in-1, Lenovo put the fingerprint reader to the left of the arrow keys. So that appears to be a touch reserved for Yoga laptops alone.

Sure, you’ll get used to it — and if you like this machine and plan on spending a lot of time with it, perhaps that won’t be an issue for you.

The trackpad feels nice and smooth, and it’s plenty large. When you click down, there’s a fine click that isn’t mushy. I would like to see laptops like this one include haptic trackpads — that’s just my preference — but this is a good mechanical trackpad.

Lenovo also includes a Yoga Pen, which magnetically attaches to the top of the laptop, on the lid right below the camera bump. It’s an active pen that charges via USB-C. You can use it to draw on the laptop’s display, and it works well if you’re looking for that kind of pen experience on a consumer laptop with a 360-degree hinge.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Display and speakers

IDG / Chris Hoffman

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 has an excellent 14-inch OLED display with a touchscreen. It’s designed to wow — with a 2880×1800 resolution, HDR support, and the vivid colors OLED displays are known for. The screen is glossy, unlike the matte one on the business-focused ThinkPad X1 2-in-1. This machine is more interested in providing the most beautiful screen possible for media consumption, while the ThinkPad’s anti-glare display is more optimized for readability in various lighting conditions. It’s always a trade-off when selecting a laptop.

To be clear, the screen glare is not unusual — this is just what happens in harsh lighting conditions when a laptop has a glossy OLED display.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

The Lenovo Yoga 2-in-1’s display tops out at a refresh rate of 120Hz, but it has a variable refresh rate, which probably helps Lenovo squeeze more battery life from this system. In fact, the most impressive thing about the display is probably that Lenovo has managed to squeeze long battery life out of this system, despite a display that feels like it should be power-hungry. Intel Lunar Lake is necessary, but the variable refresh rate on the display and the larger battery built into the laptop are probably the things that complete the puzzle.

Lenovo makes a big deal of the rotating soundbar, saying it “allows the device to project audio independent of the device’s orientation.” The soundbar has two tweeters that rotate with the screen, and the laptop has two woofers on the bottom. The speaker setup sounds quite good. Listening to Steely Dan’s Aja on Spotify—a classic audiophile test track for speakers—the sound was clear and detailed. Swapping over to Daft Punk’s Get Lucky for a more electronic sound with more bass, the audio sounded punchy and fun — but obviously without the kind of bass you’d get from a good pair of headphones or external speakers.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Webcam, microphone, biometrics

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 has a 5 MP webcam with a 1440p resolution. That sounds great on paper. It looks high-quality, too, with a clear picture. In fact, it’s one of the better webcams I’ve seen on a laptop — even compared to the webcams on some business laptops I’ve reviewed. The quality is more than good enough for video meetings and calls.

Lenovo has also included a physical privacy shutter, so you can block the laptop by sliding a switch right above the webcam. These are always good to see.

The microphone picks up clean, clear audio and has good noise cancellation in a room with desktop PC fans whirring. To my ears, it may be one of the better microphone setups I’ve tried in a laptop recently. Given that the Yoga line primarily caters to consumers, the webcam and microphone performance is impressive.

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 has a fingerprint reader at the bottom-right corner of the keyboard and an IR camera built into the camera bar above the display. You can sign in with Windows Hello using either your fingerprint or face. Both work well.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Connectivity

IDG / Chris Hoffman

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 doesn’t have the largest selection of ports, but I’ve seen worse. On the left side, you’ll find a USB Type-C port (USB 20Gbps) and a USB Type-A port (USB 10Gbps.)

On the right side, you’ll find two Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB 40Gbps) and a combo audio jack.

This laptop charges via USB-C, so you’ll plug the charger into one of those USB Type-C ports.

Anyone looking for an HDMI out port, a microSD card reader, or a second USB Type-A port will need to look elsewhere. (For example, the business-focused ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 has a built-in HDMI out port.) But this isn’t too bad for this type of portable laptop, especially if you’re prepared to use a dongle if you ever need more ports.

I’m just happy to see Lenovo included a headphone jack on this machine! I’ve reviewed a similarly named Lunar Lake-powered Yoga laptop without a headphone jack, the Yoga Slim 9i.

Thanks to Intel’s Lunar Lake, this machine also comes with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 as standard. It’s imperative that these features become standard for new laptops.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Performance

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 delivers snappy desktop performance thanks to its Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU. Lunar Lake works well for day-to-day productivity applications and delivers extremely long battery life — plus surprisingly good graphics performance for integrated graphics hardware.

As always, though, we ran the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 through our standard benchmarks to see how it performs.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

First, we run PCMark 10 to get an idea of overall system performance. With an overall PCMark 10 score of 7,719, the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 seems to squeeze every bit of performance it can out of Lunar Lake’s hardware. We like to test laptops in their default state without tweaking them much — like a normal PC user would experience them — and I imagine recent changes to Windows 11 that put laptops into a higher-performance state automatically when they’re plugged in helped this machine in the benchmarks.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

Next, we run Cinebench R20. This test is a heavily multithreaded benchmark that focuses on overall CPU performance. It’s a quick benchmark, so cooling under extended workloads isn’t a factor. But, since it’s heavily multithreaded, CPUs with more cores have a huge advantage.

With a multithreaded Cinebench R20 score of 4,306, Intel’s Lunar Lake hardware shows its biggest weakness here. With fewer CPU cores, it’s not just substantially slower at multithreaded CPU workloads than AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 series hardware, which also has an NPU and can run Copilot+ PC AI features. It’s also substantially slower than Intel’s own previous-generation Meteor Lake chips. Lunar Lake does provide longer battery life than its competitors, but it comes at a cost.

This isn’t representative of real-world productivity application usage, which is good — but it will be an issue for multithreaded CPU-heavy workloads.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

We also run an encode with Handbrake. This test is another heavily multithreaded benchmark, but it runs over an extended period. It demands the laptop’s cooling kick in, and many laptops will throttle and slow down under load.

The Lenovo Yoga 9i completed the encode process in an average of 1,414 minutes, which is about 23 and a half minutes. Again, multithreaded CPU performance is a weakness here.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

Next, we run a graphical benchmark. This isn’t a gaming laptop, but it’s still good to check how the GPU performs. We run 3DMark Time Spy, a graphical benchmark that focuses on GPU performance.

With a 3DMark Time Spy score of 4,716, Lunar Lake delivers great graphics performance for integrated graphics — second only to laptops with discrete Nvidia or AMD graphics hardware.

Overall, this machine delivers solid performance. This laptop showcases Lunar Lake at its peak performance. It also struggles with Lunar Lake’s lower-than-ideal multithreaded performance, as Intel included fewer cores on Lunar Lake than on the last-generation Meteor Lake hardware. That’s only a concern if you have workloads that need sustained multithreaded performance, but it’s an important thing to consider on a $1,749 laptop.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Battery life

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 combined a substantial 75 watt-hour battery with long-lasting Lunar Lake hardware, so we’d hope it would have long battery life. And it does — it’s very impressive.

IDG / Chris Hoffman

To benchmark the battery life, we play a 4K copy of Tears of Steel on repeat on Windows 11 with airplane mode enabled until the laptop suspends itself. We set the screen to 250 nits of brightness for our battery benchmarks, and it’s worth noting that the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1’s OLED display has a bit of an advantage, as OLED screens use less power to display the black bars around the video. This is a best-case scenario for any laptop since local video playback is so efficient, and real battery life in day-to-day use is always going to be less than this.

The Lenovo Yoga 9i lasted for 1414 minutes before suspending itself — that’s 23 and a half hours. The OLED display almost certainly uses more power, but the choice of a variable refresh rate for the display and the larger battery help this machine achieve extremely long battery life.

Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1: Conclusion

The Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition is a sleek machine with a beautiful display and long battery life. The 2-in-1 experience is great. It’s as nice as it looks in the photos.

The downsides are evident: the glossy screen may not be ideal in certain situations, the low multithreaded CPU performance may disrupt some people’s workflows, and the fingerprint reader located to the right of the arrow keys may not be to everyone’s liking. But the main concern is the price — at $1,749, this is a little on the premium-priced side for a consumer laptop. Still, it is a 2-in-1, and a high-quality one at that.

This is a wonderful laptop for people looking for a sleek, portable 2-in-1 with a vivid display and long battery life. If those are your priorities — and the price seems reasonable to you — this machine is great."

However, these patches had to be downloaded and installed manually in Windows. Even almost a year later, 7zip is probably still running in outdated and malware-prone versions on many PCs.

This would not have happened with a so-called package manager, which installs new program versions automatically and without intervention. In other words, just as has long been the case with smartphones, Linux, and Macs.

The same applies under Windows for apps from the Microsoft Store, provided the “App updates” option is activated in the Store settings. However, programs installed in the usual way are not updated automatically.

See also: How to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10

While package managers have long been standard on other systems, they have led a shadowy existence on Windows.

Tools such as Iobit Software Updater, Patch my PC, Secunia Personal Update Inspector, SUMo (Software Update Monitor), or Updatestar have existed for some time, but each has its weak points or is severely limited in its functionality in the free version.

When Microsoft launched its package manager for Windows, the tool could initially only be operated via the command line. This required considerable familiarization. Foundry

First, however, we will explain Microsoft’s own package manager Winget, which is integrated in Windows 10 and 11 and which you actually have to control somewhat awkwardly via the command line.

Uniget UI makes everything simple

Operation became much easier with the graphical user interface called WingetUI, which stands for “Winget User Interface.”

This tool suddenly made it possible to install new software conveniently with the mouse and without the usual “Next” confirmations and to automatically keep programs already running on the PC up to date.

Because WingetUI is no longer limited to Winget, but also supports other console package managers, it has since been renamed Uniget UI.

See also: New Outlook: How to use offline mode and save emails locally

Installation: As Microsoft’s package manager, Winget itself is part of Windows 10 and 11, you only need to install the Uniget UI interface. During setup, make sure to install the tool for all user accounts in the first step.

Depending on the settings, you may need to allow Uniget UI to make changes to the system in User Account Control (UAC). You can carry out the remaining steps with all the default settings.

This includes, in particular, installing the additional package manager Chocolatey . Finally, click on “Finish” and Uniget UI will start automatically.

Before we go into the functions in more detail, you should activate the option “Ask for administrator rights only once” under “Settings > Settings for administrator rights” at the bottom left.

This will save you a lot of queries later on. If desired, you can also instruct Uniget UI to automatically install all available updates under “Update settings.”

However, you should deactivate this option first, as this way you can always keep an eye on the updates and familiarize yourself with Uniget UI.

The important functions of Uniget UI

UniGetUI

Uniget UI is configured during setup so that it starts automatically when the computer is switched on. You can recognize this by the new icon at the bottom right of the taskbar.

A green dot in the icon indicates that new software updates are available. At the top left of the program interface, you will see four important areas. Use “Discover packages” to install new programs; you can read more about this in the “Installing new programs” box below.

The “Software updates” are at the center of the following explanations. The third area “Installed packages” shows which programs are installed, similar to the Windows internal apps list in the Windows settings.

See also: Annoyed by Windows PC notifications? Here’s how to turn them off

However, Uniget UI sometimes lists significantly more entries here. This can be important because the tools can be removed from the system using the Uniget UI function “Uninstall selected packages.”

Finally, “Package bundles” is also used to install software. However, instead of installing them individually, several programs can be combined into a “bundle,” saved, and installed later on another computer in one go.

Installing new programs In addition to the automatic updates of installed programs, Uniget UI offers another clever function, the “Silent Install.” This term refers to the installation of software without prompting: Instead of clicking “OK” or “Next” several times during the setup process, Uniget UI installs the software autonomously. This is how it works: To install a program in this way, open Uniget UI, click on “Discover packages” in the top left-hand corner, type the name of the desired program in the search field on the right and confirm with the Enter key. After a short moment, the program you are looking for will appear. Select it and install it by clicking on “Install selected packages.” Depending on the software, it is offered in several versions, which differ in terms of language, version number, and more. Select the desired version from these. Two final notes: The possibility of combining several programs into a “package bundle” and saving them in order to install them in one go has already been mentioned in the article. Secondly: If you want to change the installation settings for a specific program, deactivate the silent install of Uniget UI using the “Install selection” button at the top center. The usual confirmations with their change options will then appear during setup. UniGetUI

Checking the software on your computer for updates by hand is a thing of the past with Uniget UI. The tool does this automatically. As soon as the green dot or a Windows notification appears in the program icon in the taskbar, you open the tool interface.

All available updates are already selected and marked; click on the “Install selected packages” button to update everything to the latest version.

Uniget UI then downloads the updates and installs them; you can track the status or progress of each software below. The process may only be interrupted if the User Account Control (UAC) requires your authorization.

It runs fully automatically and without any intervention if you move the UAC slider all the way down to “Never notify” and confirm this setting with “OK.” Depending on the scope and number of updates, downloading and installing takes time. Finally, the confirmation “Hooray! No updates were found.”

If you want to temporarily exclude one or more program from updating, deactivate them in the list and only then start the update. If you want to defer one or more update completely, you can do this by clicking the “Ignore selected packages” button.

You can run the deferred updates again at any time via “Manage ignored updates” to the right.

Note: Do not be confused if sometimes only one and sometimes several appear under “Sources” when updating. A total of nine package managers or repositories are preset and active in Uniget UI; the tool automatically selects the appropriate source for each software.

Conclusion

The interface for Winget, Chocolatey, and others finally makes using package managers convenient under Windows. Instead of typing commands into the command line, with Uniget UI you can do everything with a click of the mouse.

The tool installs and updates almost everything beyond commercial software and thus closes existing security gaps, fixes errors, or activates additional functions.

Iobit Software Updater also points out outdated full versions such as Paintshop Pro (above) and offers an update. However, you may need a new licence. IDG

By their very nature, package managers cannot install new versions of paid software, which is why they usually do not even display them.

This is where the full version of Iobit Software Updater Pro can help: The software offers unlimited updates for more than 700 programs and even does this automatically at the user’s request.

The tool compares the installed versions with a database and installs any missing updates automatically.

Note: If you use two or more package managers, the results may differ in detail. Sometimes one of the tools shows a new software version that is still missing in the database of the other.

Sometimes there are also different deployment cycles, for example standard and long-term versions (ESR). This is not a “fault” of the package manager, but is due to the version installed by the user."

Advanced efforts to help prevent child labor and support community resilience, expanding Child Labor Monitoring & Remediation Systems to cover ~89% of Cocoa Life communities in West Africa by the end of 2024.



CHICAGO, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mondelēz International, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDLZ) today released its 2024 Human Rights Due Diligence and Modern Slavery Report, outlining the company’s progress in helping to prevent, identify, and address potential human rights and modern slavery risks across its operations and value chain.

“Doing what’s right is ingrained in our Snacking Made Right mission. We strive to embed human rights due diligence into how we do business every day,” said Chris McGrath, Chief Impact & Sustainability Officer, Mondelēz International. “The scale of challenges needs increased focus and meaningful partnerships – and we continue to evolve and make progress on both fronts. We have strong execution plans that we believe will continue to support our growth around the world, underpinned by our focus on promoting a culture where everyone is treated with care and integrity.”



Scaling and Enhancing Due Diligence across the Value Chain

Beyond information included in the 2024 Report released today, Mondelēz International continues to strengthen its human rights due diligence (HRDD) across both its own operations and supplier network:



~96% of owned manufacturing sites and ~98% of prioritized suppliers have completed third-party SMETA audits in the past 3 years.

HRDD coverage has been expanded to increase coverage of suppliers’ manufacturing and logistic sites handling the company’s finished products.

Since launching its dedicated Human Rights Policy in 2021, the company has trained more than ~50,000 colleagues on human rights issues, including ~7,000 in manufacturing and logistics, and ~3,000 in key stewardship roles.



As part of its focus on prioritized ingredients, Mondelēz International continued scaling its signature cocoa sustainability program Cocoa Life in 2024:



Partnering with around 208,000 farmers and backed by a $1 billion investment from 2012 through 2030.

As of year-end 2024, approximately 89% of Cocoa Life communities in West Africa – representing approximately 2,480 communities – are covered by Child Labor Monitoring & Remediation System (CLMRS).

The company aims to cover all West African Cocoa Life communities with a CLMRS by the end of 2025 and has conducted more than 240,000 interviews to help prevent child labor.



Cocoa Life’s integrated approach focused on developing ways to help make cocoa farming more profitable, help protect and restore forests and help lift local cocoa communities. This includes efforts focused on women’s empowerment, income diversification, and entrepreneurship through Village Savings and Loan Associations and partnerships with CARE International.

Sector Collaboration to Accelerate Impact

Mondelēz International believes addressing systemic human rights issues in ingredient supply chains needs collaboration between governments, industry, and civil society. To help address child labor in the West African Cocoa supply chain, in 2024, the company deepened its support for sector-wide systemic solutions, through its continued support and investment of ~$3million from 2022 to 2026 in the Child Learning and Education Facility (CLEF), which aims to reach over 4 million children by transforming rural education in Cote d’Ivoire.



Building on the success of the CLEF initiative, Mondelēz International is supporting the development of a new public-private partnership, the System Change Architecture for Learning Excellence (SCALE) initiative to help improve the quality of education in Ghana with an investment of ~$1million over the next four years.

SCALE is innovating how national-level financing can be unlocked.

To date, three philanthropic partners and 10 cocoa and chocolate companies have joined forces to support SCALE — a collaborative co-funding mechanism that will inject further funds into the Ghana Accountability for Learning Outcomes Project (GALOP), a five-year governmental initiative seeking to improve the quality of education in low-performing basic education (ages 4-15) schools and strengthen the education sector across Ghana. It focuses on strengthening teaching capacity, accountability and leadership systems, access to high-quality school resources, and better operational management.

It is the first time that private and philanthropic organizations have raised enough finance to trigger the Global Partnership for Education’s (GPE) Multiplier Grant in Ghana.

By pooling US$40 million, SCALE partners were able to unlock an additional US$40 million from GPE to support GALOP.

Beyond cocoa, the company’s multiple collaborations with industry coalitions help support the company’s progress and human rights efforts. These include:



Co-chairing the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Human Rights Coalition, to help shape industry leading practices. This year, Mondelēz supported the development of the Best Practice Note on Human Rights Defenders which aims to inspire businesses in helping to better protect human rights defenders.

Supporting World Cocoa Foundation’s (WCF) vision to catalyze a thriving and equitable cocoa sector.

Serving as a member of the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) Board of Directors to support sector-wide progress in addressing child labor in West African cocoa.

Joining the Coalition for Responsible Sugarcane India (CRSI) to help strengthen human rights practices in India’s sugarcane sector.

Co-chairing the CAOBISCO’s partnership with the International Labor Organization to help combat child labor in seasonal harvesting of hazelnuts in Turkey.

Partnering with WageMap, a new initiative to drive alignment across living wage methodologies and frameworks.

Our Human Rights Approach

At Mondelēz International, we are committed to making our snacks the right way, including respecting the human rights of people in our value chain. As part of our business practices, we use the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as a guide to prevent and mitigate associated risks, supporting our commitment to fostering a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment, as detailed in our Human Rights Policy.

Animal source foods(ASF) provide essential nutrients like high-quality protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and vitamin B12, which are vital for the physical and cognitive development of young children and to reduce the burden of malnutrition. In Ethiopia malnutrition among children under five remains a significant public health issue. Many children are suffering from chronic and acute undernutrition. This study provides the first spatial analysis of animal source foods consumption among children aged 6–23 months. Objectives The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial distribution of ASF consumption and its associated factors among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia using data from the Ethiopia miniDHS 2019. Methodology A cross-sectional study design was used using mini-DHS 2019 data among children aged 6–23 months. Descriptive statistics were used to summarized the study population characteristics and ASF consumption prevalence. Spatial analysis techniques, including Geographical mapping and Moran’s I statistic assessed the spatial distribution of ASF consumption. Geographically weighted regression analyses identified socio-economic, demographic, and geographic factors associated with ASF consumption. Results The study found that 47.7% of Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months consume ASF. Children in regions like Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul-Gumuz, western SNNPR, and Gambela are less likely to consume these foods. Factors linked to higher ASF consumption include mothers with more education, smaller families, households following the Orthodox religion, and wealthier families.. Conclusion and Recommendations According to this study finding animal source food consumption among Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months is relatively low. The finding revealed the significant regional disparities of ASF consumptions. Factors associated with ASF consumption include maternal education, household size, wealth, and religion. Efforts should focus on working to increase maternal education, providing and expansion of family planning services, and increasing affordability of ASF through economic improvement of households. In addition strengthening food supply chains and integrating ASF promotion into healthcare are also essential for improving child nutrition. Interventions in low-consumption areas should address specific local needs to effectively boost ASF consumption and improve child nutrition outcomes.

Introduction Malnutrition is a major global health issue, especially affecting children aged 6–23 months. Globally, 149 million children under five years suffer from stunted growth, a direct result of inadequate nutrition during their early years [1]. This issue is critical, as malnutrition accounts for an estimated 54% of child mortality worldwide [2]. About 47 million children under five are wasted [3] and 144 million children suffer from stunting and among these 40% are from sub-Saharan Africa [4]. In low- and middle-income countries the prevalence of underweight is 16% in urban settings and 30% in rural areas [5]. The Ethiopian 2019 mini-DHS found that while malnutrition rates have slowly declined over the past decade, under-five children still face high levels of malnutrition. Specifically, 37% of these children are stunted, 7% are wasted, and 21% are underweight [6]. In early childhood, malnutrition reduces educational attainment and work productivity, while also increasing the risk of chronic diseases later in life. These effects limit individual potential and have significant implications for broader socioeconomic development [7]. The causes of malnutrition differ based on geographical context and can change over time [8]. Child malnutrition is primarily caused by inadequate or inappropriate nutritional intake that does not meet the physiological requirements necessary for healthy growth and development [9,10]. Proper nutrition during the first two years of life is crucial for ensuring children’s optimal growth, development, and long-term health [11]. The period from 6 to 23 months is a critical window for growth and development, during which children transition from exclusive breastfeeding to complementary feeding [12]. A child’s diet quality should include a diverse range of food components to ensure a comprehensive and balanced nutrition [13]. Among the various components of a child’s diet, animal source foods (ASF) such as meat, milk, and eggs play an indispensable role [14,15]. Animal source foods are superior to plant-based foods in terms of micronutrient and protein quality as they provide higher concentrations of essential nutrients with greater bioavailability [16,17]. Among the essential nutrients supplied by animal source foods are iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), riboflavin, vitamin A, and vitamin B12. As a result, incorporating even small quantities of ASFs can greatly enhance the adequacy of the overall diet [16,18]. In low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia, many children often experience restricted access to and availability of ASFs. Inadequate intake of ASF during early childhood is linked to stunting, anemia and delayed development particularly in low-income settings [19]. Previous study revealed that only 14% of children aged 6–23 months meet minimum dietary diversity requirements, with only 8% consuming meat, fish, or poultry, and about 17% and 25% eating eggs and dairy products, respectively [20]. Another study showed that only 22.7% of children in Ethiopia consume ASFs, indicating that only one in five children has access to ASF consumption [21]. Despite improvements in ASF production in the country, rapidly rising food prices and poor economic access have limited ASF consumption. As a result, many rural households rely predominantly on maize and legumes for their diet [22].Various factors influence ASF consumption. These include women’s and child characteristics, religious practices such as fasting, and socio-economic factors such as wealth status [22]. Additionally, a low level of nutrition, knowledge, low health service utilization, availability of livestock’s, low educational level of mothers, number of children in the household has also been reported as a factor affecting ASF consumption [21]. To adress undernutrition in children aged 6–23 months, Ethiopia has implemented targeted interventions focusing on promoting optimal feeding practices and addressing micronutrient deficiencies [23]. For instance, the Productive Safety Net Program(PSNPs) enhances household food security, thereby improving young children’s nutritional outcomes. Additionally, micronutrient supplementation, including vitamin A and iron, effectively prevents deficiencies. Moreover, community-based nutrition education enhances caregiver knowledge and practices, while improved healthcare services provide vital support and monitoring. Furthermore, the ‘Seqota’ Declaration, introduced in 2015, aims to eliminate stunting in children under 2 years by 2030 [15]. Despite these comprehensive measures, malnutrition remains a significant public health issue, with regional disparities in dietary practices and access to nutritious foods. This study seeks to fill a gap in the existing literature, as limited research has been conducted on how spatial and socio-economic factors influence ASF intake in Ethiopia. Examining the spatial distribution of ASF consumption is critical for formulating effective nutrition policies in Ethiopia. This study utilizes Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to assess the impact of spatial and socio-economic factors on ASF intake among children aged 6–23 months. Given Ethiopia’s diverse socio-cultural and ecological landscape, GWR allows for location-specific analysis, offering more precise insights for targeted interventions. The results will inform the development of targeted interventions aimed at mitigating malnutrition and enhancing child health through context-specific dietary strategies.

Methodology Study design and period This study utilizes a cross-sectional design based on data from the 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographic and Health Survey (mini-EDHS) to investigate the spatial patterns of ASF consumption and its associated factors among children aged 6–23 months. The mini-EDHS is a nationally representative survey that provides comprehensive data on various health and demographic indicators, including child nutrition. Following full-scale DHS surveys in 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016, the 2019 mini-EDHS provides essential trend data and aids policymakers in shaping health programs. The survey was conducted from March 21, 2019, to June 28, 2019, using a nationally representative sample that allowed for estimates at national, regional, urban, and rural levels [24]. Study setting The study was conducted in Ethiopia, a strategically located country in the Horn of Africa, situated between latitudes 3° and 14.8° N and longitudes 33° and 48° E. It shares borders with Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, and Eritrea, extending over a total border length of 5,311 km. Ethiopia is the 10th largest country in Africa and the second most populous, with a population exceeding 115 million [25]. Ethiopia is administratively divided into nine regions: Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somalia, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Gambela, and Harari, as well as two self-administered cities, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. Source and study population The 2019 mini-EDHS employed a two-stage stratified sampling approach. In the first stage, 305 enumeration areas (EAs) were selected, with 93 in urban and 212 in rural areas, using probability proportional to size. To manage large EAs, which had more than 300 households, they were segmented, and only one segment was chosen for the survey. In the second stage, 30 households were systematically selected from each segment [24]. This design ensured comprehensive coverage and precise data collection across different regions. Since the probability of selecting each household was not uniform, sample weighting was used in the analysis. Total weighted samples of 1,460 children aged 6–23 months who were the youngest and lived with their mother were included in the analysis (Fig 1). PPT PowerPoint slide

Variables Dependent variable Animal Source Foods Consumption: Consumption of animal sources was considered if a child aged 6–23 months, living with their mother, reported eating at least one of the following foods within the 24 hours prior to the interview: 1) eggs, 2) meat (beef, lamb, goat, or chicken), 3) fresh or dried fish or shellfish, 4) organ meats such as heart or liver, and 5) milk and milk products. Children were divided into two groups according to their consumption of ASF. Children who consumed ASF were given a value of 1, while those who did not were given a value of 0. Finally, a weighted proportion of ASF per cluster was utilized for spatial analysis. Independent variables Sociodemographic characteristics. The independent variables examined in this study were selected from a review of existing literature. These variables include child related factors, maternal, and community characteristics.. From child characteristics age was divided into four groups: 6–8 months, 9–11 months, 12–17 months, and 18–23 months, allowing for a detailed analysis of different developmental stages and nutritional needs. The respondent’s characteristics include age, educational status, marital status, occupation, total number of children in the household, religion and place of residence. Age is categorized into three groups: 15–24 years, 25–34 years, and 35–49 years, to account for generational differences in knowledge and practices related to child nutrition. Educational status was categorized as no education, primary, secondary, and higher education or above. Marital status is divided into married and not married to examine the impact of family structure on child nutrition.. The type of place of residence, whether urban or rural, is also included to capture the environmental context in which the child is raised. This factor is important as it affects access to resources, healthcare services, and nutritional options, which in turn influence ASF consumption. Socioeconomic factors. The wealth index in this study classifies households into five categories based on their economic status: Poorest, Poor, Middle, Rich, and Richest. This classification is derived from a range of assets and living conditions, including ownership of livestock, household items, and access to basic services such as electricity and sanitation. Thus, the wealth index can significantly influence the quality and variety of the diet, including the consumption of ASF, by reflecting the household’s ability to access and afford these important nutritional resources. Health service-related factors. Factors related to birth and delivery include the birth order of the index child, whether the child was delivered via cesarean section, antenatal follow-up, postnatal follow-up, and whether the respondent received counseling about breastfeeding from health workers. These factors are crucial in understanding the healthcare interactions that may affect child feeding practices and the consumption of ASF. Data collection and tools The data for the analysis of ASF consumption were collected through face-to-face interviews using structured questionnaires at both individual and household levels. During the data collection period, mothers of children aged 6–23 months were asked to provide detailed information on various factors related to ASF consumption. This included socio-demographic details, socioeconomic status, health service utilization, and child-specific characteristics. The goal was to gather comprehensive data on how these factors influence the consumption of ASF among young children in Ethiopia. Data management and analysis To analyze ASF consumption, we first tabulated the proportions of both ASF and potential predictor variables using STATA, then exported the data to Excel for further examination. First we adjusted the data for ASF consumption and explanatory variables using sample weights. For understanding spatial patterns, we used ArcGIS 10.7 and SaTScan V.9.6 software to detect local clusters. Records with missing values in the outcome variable (ASF consumption) were excluded, as per DHS recommendations to retain only cases with complete outcome information. For independent variables, a complete case analysis was used since the proportion of missing data was small. Sampling weights (v005/1,000,000) were applied to adjust for the multi-stage sampling design and ensure representativeness, following DHS guidelines. Global spatial autocorrelation To assess the spatial distribution of ASF consumption, we used ArcGIS 10.7(ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA, version 10.7) software. For spatial autocorrelation and to identify hot spot areas. We applied the Global Moran’s I statistic to determine whether ASF consumption among children aged 6–23 months was dispersed, clustered, or randomly distributed across Ethiopia. Moran’s I values close to -1 indicate a dispersed pattern, values close to +1 suggest a clustered pattern, and a value around 0 reflects a random distribution. The identification of hot spots and cold spots for ASF consumption was further refined using z-scores and significant p-values from the hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*). Spatial interpolation To estimate ASF consumption in unsampled areas, we used spatial interpolation techniques. The Ordinary Kriging Gaussian interpolation method was employed to predict ASF intake among children. This method helps minimize prediction uncertainty and filter out measurement errors. We constructed a semi-variogram model based on input data from sampled locations to determine weights for predicting new values in unsampled areas, resulting in a simulated semi-variogram model. Spatial scan statistics For local cluster detection, we used SaTScan version 10.1 software [26]. We applied a purely spatial Bernoulli-based model to identify statistically significant clusters with high or low rates of ASF consumption. Children who consumed ASF within 24 hours were considered cases, while those who did not were controls. The Bernoulli model scanned the study area with a moving window, excluding regions outside the study bounds. We set the maximum spatial cluster size to less than 50% of the population to detect both small and large clusters, discarding those exceeding this limit. Each potential cluster was assessed using a log-likelihood ratio test to determine if the number of observed cases was significantly higher than expected. The cluster with the highest likelihood ratio was identified as the primary cluster. Primary and secondary clusters were then ranked and assigned p-values based on the likelihood ratio test results from 999 Monte Carlo simulations. Spatial regression Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). To understand the factors influencing ASF consumption across the study area, we used spatial regression modeling. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model provided a broad overview by estimating a single coefficient for each explanatory variable throughout the entire region. For the OLS results to be reliable, several key conditions had to be met. These included having statistically significant coefficients with the correct direction, ensuring the model was non-stationary, including all important variables, and avoiding multicollinearity. Additionally, the residuals needed to be normally distributed and free from any spatial patterns or autocorrelation. We used a data mining tool to select a model that met these OLS requirements and demonstrated high adjusted R² values. The final model was validated through internal cross-validation, and we checked for multicollinearity (with a variance inflation factor of less than 7.5) to ensure that the independent variables were not redundant. Geographically weighted regression analysis A predictor that is influential in one area might not be as significant in another. This variation, known as non-stationarity, can be detected using GWR. Unlike OLS, which applies one regression equation to the entire study area, GWR creates a separate equation for each cluster. As a result, the coefficients in GWR vary from one cluster to another, providing a more nuanced understanding of how different factors affect ASF consumption in different regions. The GWR map of the coefficients of each predictor variable guides targeted interventions. where yi is the observation of response; (uivi) is the latitude and longitude; βk (ui, vi) (k = 0, 1,… p) is the p unknown function of the geographical location (uivi); xik is the independent variable at location (uivi), where i is equal to 1,. 2,…; and εi is the error term/residual with zero mean and homogeneous variance σ.

Our study was based on secondary data from Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey and we have secured the permission letter from the main Demographic Health and Survey.

Discussion The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial pattern and factors influencing the consumption of ASF among children aged 6–23 months old in Ethiopia. The prevalence of ASF consumption was 47.7% (95% CI: 45.1% - 50.2%), highlighting a consistent clustering of both high and low consumption areas among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Several important factors were found to be associated with increased consumption of ASF, such as mothers with higher levels of education, households with a smaller number of children, and families belonging to the highest wealth index. Conversely, a greater percentage of individuals following the Orthodox religion was correlated with reduced consumption of ASF. The prevalence of ASF consumption (47.7%) among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia was consistent with the studies done in Ethiopia which showed that ASF prevalence was 48.3%, 46.5% respectively [27,28]. On the other hand the finding of this study was higher than the study conducted in sub-Saharan African countries which showed the prevalence of ASF consumption was 43.1% [29]. Several factors may contribute for this discrepancy, including differences in dietary practices, cultural preferences, socioeconomic status, and access to ASF across different regions. Moreover, local nutritional interventions and programs in Ethiopia may have contributed to the higher prevalence of ASF consumption observed in this study. Ethiopia has adopted the Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, the National Nutrition Program, the Food and Nutrition Policy, and the National Food and Nutrition Strategy as comprehensive measures to improve dietary practices, combat undernutrition, and promote the consumption of animal source foods [30,31]. The prevalence of ASF consumption observed in this study is higher than previous DHS surveys in Ethiopia, which reported ASF consumption prevalence rates of 31.3% in 2005, 35.9% in 2011, and 41.5% in 2016 [32]. This increase might be due to improvements in nutritional programs and growing awareness about the importance of ASF in children’s diets could play a role. Additionally, better socioeconomic conditions and more accessible ASF might also be contributing to this trend. Moreover, targeted interventions and government policies focused on boosting child nutrition may have further supported this rise in ASF consumption. The study found that children from orthodox Christian follower had decrease the consumption of ASF. This finding is consistent with the previous studies [28,33]. The doctrine of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church includes numerous fasting days throughout the year, such as most Wednesdays and Fridays. Additionally, there are extended fasting periods like the Great Lent Fast, which lasts 55 days, and the Fast of the Prophets, which lasts 43 days [33,34]. During these times, adults abstain from ASF, including eggs and dairy products. Even though fasting practices in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church primarily target adults, children’s reduced consumption of ASF during these periods can be attributed to family dietary adjustments, parental influence, resource reallocation, and cultural norms extending to children’s diets. The current study found that higher levels of maternal education were significantly associated with increased ASF consumption among children. This finding aligns with several studies conducted in Ethiopia. For instance, a study in the Ethiopia found that children of mothers with secondary or higher education were more likely to consume ASF compared to those whose mothers had no formal education [32,35]. Another study in sub-Saharan country reported similar results, indicating that maternal education positively influences child nutrition by increasing knowledge about healthy feeding practices and access to diverse food options [29]. A study in China also supports this association, finding that maternal education was a strong predictor of better dietary diversity, including higher ASF intake among young children [36]. Specifically, educated mothers are more likely to understand the nutritional benefits of ASF and have better access to resources that facilitate the provision of a diverse diet for their children [37]. This study revealed that households with a smaller number of children (two or fewer) were more likely to have higher ASF consumption among children. This observation aligns with findings from various studies that indicate smaller household size often correlates with better child nutrition [38,39]. Household size, as a significant socioeconomic determinant, has been shown to affect food security with larger households often facing reduced food acquisition and lower per capita consumption of animal source foods (ASF) due to greater resource constraints [40,41]. Animal source foods are expensive making it challenging for larger families to afford enough for everyone. In larger households, the financial strain often means that ASF is sold to cover other essential family needs, which reduces the amount available for children to consume.. Therefore, the cost of ASF and its impact on family finances play a crucial role in the differences in ASF consumption between small and large households. This study showed that families belonging to the highest wealth index were significantly more likely to have higher ASF consumption among children. This association has been documented in multiple studies. In a study from Ethiopia, higher household wealth was associated with increased consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products among children [22]. Another study from sub-Saharan Africa also found that children from wealthier families had a significantly higher likelihood of consuming ASF [29]. Research from Nepal corroborates these findings, indicating that higher household wealth is associated with increased consumption of flesh foods and dairy products among children [42]. Wealthier households can afford a more diverse diet, including more expensive items like ASF. Their wealth allows them access to a variety of foods and reduces the risk of food insecurity, leading to better nutritional outcomes. Additionally, these households often have better access to markets, making it easier for them to purchase a range of foods, including ASF [43]. Strengths and limitations of this study This study has several strengths. Firstly, it uses the 2019 EDHS dataset, which is nationally representative and enhances the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the study includes spatial analysis, which helps account for regional variations in ASF consumption. However, this study has a few limitations. The data from the Mini-EDHS 2019 are cross-sectional, so causality cannot be established. Additionally, self-reported dietary data may introduce recall bias. Some relevant factors, like household food access, may not be fully captured in the dataset. Lastly, while the GWR model highlights regional variations, unmeasured confounders could still influence the findings. Conclusion and recommendation The study reveals that 47.7% of Ethiopian children aged 6–23 months consume ASF which is relatively low and with notable clustering of low consumption areas in regions such as Amhara, Tigray, Benishangul-Gumuz, western SNNPR, and Gambela region. This clustering indicates significant regional variations in ASF consumption among this demographic. Key factors associated with higher ASF consumption include maternal education, smaller household size, a higher proportion of Orthodox religion followers, and greater household wealth. These findings underscore the influence of socioeconomic and cultural factors on ASF consumption patterns. To improve ASF consumption, we should focus on educating mothers about the benefits of ASFs, especially in areas where intake is low. Reducing family sizes through better access to family planning can help families afford more nutritious foods. Supporting economic growth will also improve access to ASFs. Programs need to be tailored to local needs, with subsidies making these foods more affordable, and involving communities in designing solutions. Working with private and public sectors to strengthen food supply chains and integrating ASF promotion into healthcare will help ensure lasting improvements in nutrition. Policymakers and public health practitioners should prioritize maternal education, family planning, and poverty alleviation strategies, especially in identified low-consumption areas, to improve ASF intake and child nutrition outcomes nationally.

On the other hand, 34 per cent of the respondents indicated that they would hire to support business expansion, replace existing staff, and attract new talent.

Banks and the Transport Sector will Hire More

Banks appear optimistic, with 44% of respondents indicating they will definitely increase employment and another 44% stating they probably will. Only 7% probably won’t, while 4% definitely won’t hire.

In agriculture, 16% say they will definitely hire and 26% say they probably will. A significant 42% probably won’t hire, while 16% definitely won’t.

In manufacturing, expectations are more cautious: 15% definitely will hire, 33% probably will, 30% probably won’t, and 22% definitely won’t.

The trade sector reflects the highest pessimism, with only 9% definitely expecting to hire and 29% probably will.

Meanwhile, 35% probably won’t and 26% definitely won’t—the highest “definitely won’t” figure across all sectors.
