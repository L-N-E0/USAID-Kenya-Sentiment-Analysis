Released on Tuesday, the report by the nonprofit Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) lists Cameroon, Mozambique and a host of other African nations as some of the most burdened by violence and displacement, but also the most invisible to donors.

The news comes as the United States, formerly the world’s biggest aid provider, massively cut development funding this year. Aid agencies received only half of what they needed in 2024, and experts say further shrinking aid will likely make 2025 even more bleak for people in need.

Eight African emergencies were previously ranked as the most ignored in 2023 as well.

What does the report say?

Millions of people who have been displaced and face food insecurity or lack shelter are receiving little aid because of “donor fatigue”, poor media coverage and little-to-no political resolution, according to the NRC’s 2024 Most Neglected Crises report.

The report defined countries in crisis as those that host or have more than 200,000 displaced people, and which have been declared to be in severe crisis emergencies.

Of 34 countries analysed, the most “invisible” according to the NRC report were: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Mali, Uganda, Iran, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Honduras and Somalia.

Aside from funding, there was little progress on effective conflict resolution, disaster prevention and diplomatic engagement in all the affected countries, the report added.

In general, aid funding dropped overall in 2024, the NRC noted.

“The shortfall between what was required to meet humanitarian needs in 2024 and what was delivered was a staggering $25 billion, meaning over half of all needs went unmet,” the report stated.

Why are African humanitarian emergencies ignored?

“Donor fatigue” and growing waves of nationalistic policies within traditional donor countries are causing the richest countries to reduce foreign aid funding, experts say. A lack of proximity to emergencies, analysts add, also affects attention.

“Too many crises across the continent remain in the shadows – ignored because they don’t make headlines, or because they are not seen as of immediate strategic interest to international partners,” Christelle Hure, NRC’s head of advocacy in West and Central Africa, told Al Jazeera.

“Crises that knock on Europe’s door – as happened in 2015 [with mass immigration] – tend to receive the greatest media attention, while those far away remain not only out of sight but also out of mind,” Hure said.

Which are the most neglected African emergencies?

Cameroon

The West-Central African nation tops the list of the world’s most neglected crises in 2024.

In the English-speaking northeast and northwest regions of Cameroon, a protracted civil war which began in 2017 is continuing. That year, thousands took to the streets to protest against the appointment of French-speaking judges, and in general, alleged discrimination from the Francophone-majority government.

Heavy crackdowns to suppress the protests soon saw armed groups springing up, declaring independence. The government in Yaounde, in turn, declared war. Both the rebels and government forces have targeted civilians. Hundreds have died, and thousands more are displaced internally or have fled to neighbouring Nigeria.

“The violence there is largely ignored because it’s not a direct threat to the central government,” Beverly Ochieng, a security analyst with United Kingdom-based intelligence firm Control Risks, told Al Jazeera, adding that little has been done to negotiate peace. “There was a feeling initially that some of the secessionist leaders were trying to lobby Donald Trump to support their cause but they’ve just not received any attention.”

Meanwhile, in the northern Lake Chad Basin region, also connected to Nigeria, violence by the armed group, Boko Haram, has continued for years, displacing thousands. A US-backed joint force of the Lake Chad Basin countries has largely collapsed since the military governments in Niger and Chad pulled out, leaving Cameroon, Nigeria and Benin. Washington’s shrinking of security presence and operations in African nations is likely to further destabilise the arrangement.

Cameroon itself hosts refugees fleeing Boko Haram in Nigeria, as well as those from the Central African Republic fleeing fighting between two political groups. Together, some 1.1 million people are internally displaced, and 500,000 are refugees.

Despite this, Cameroon’s displacement crisis was mentioned in fewer than 30,000 articles in English, Spanish, French and Arabic in 2024, compared with the Ukraine war, which was mentioned in 451,000 articles, according to the NRC. Only 45 percent, or $168m of the $371m required, was raised to fund aid in the various crises, according to the United Nations. The government, too, is under fire for seeming indifference: President Paul Biya, 82, and in power since 1982, is often criticised for spending most of his time away in Switzerland.

Ethiopia

The aftershocks of the Tigray war in the country’s north (2020-2022) merged with new intercommunal fighting in the Oromia and Amhara regions, creating a potent mix of crises which has seen 10 million people pushed out of their homes nationwide, the NRC report noted.

The Fano armed group, which claims to represent the interests of the Amhara people, one of Ethiopia‘s significant ethnic groups, is fighting the federal army, which tried to disarm it after they both fought Tigrayan forces during the war. The Oromo Liberation Group, meanwhile, says it is seeking independence for the Oromo people, Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group. Both groups have been met with force by the government in Addis Ababa, which has launched air strikes. Dozens of civilians have died in the fighting.

In addition, drought and flooding have compounded food shortages. In the southern Gofa zone, heavy rains caused two landslides on July 21 that killed more than 200 people, the worst such landslides in the country.

Mozambique

The Southern African country appears on the list for the first time this year. Political upheaval following hotly contested October elections saw protesters who supported the independent opposition candidate, Venancio Mondlane, shot dead by Mozambican state security. About 400 people died in the violence, according to local media tallies.

Separately, ongoing attacks by an armed group with affiliations to ISIL (ISIS-Mozambique) in northern, oil-rich Cabo Delgado flared up in 2024. Violence has continued there since 2022 and has seen thousands displaced, while also disrupting a billion-dollar oil and gas investment project. Government forces working with regional troops from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Rwandan soldiers were able to push the fighters back in 2023, allowing many displaced people to return. However, because the fighters are deeply embedded in local communities, the conflict has turned volatile again very quickly.

Prone to cyclones due to its location in the Indian Ocean, Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Chido, which also devastated the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, in December. The storm made landfall in the northern region of Mozambique, which is facing armed conflict. Some 120 people were killed, and about 155,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.

Burkina Faso and Mali

Since 2015, more than two million people have been displaced in Burkina Faso because of the activities of violent armed groups like the Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), which wants to create a caliphate. Several of those groups now control close to half of the country, despite efforts by the military-led government to push them back with support from Russian forces.

The rebels have held civilians suspected of supporting government forces under siege for more than two years, blocking entries and exits to now nearly 40 towns and cities. Massacres of villagers, however, have been blamed on both armed groups and government forces who are accused of attacking civilians perceived to be aiding the fighters.

Neighbouring Mali is ranked fourth on the neglected crises list and faces a similar situation. Analyst Ochieng attributes shrinking aid to the three military-led countries of the West African Sahel, including Niger, partly to the hostile stances towards Western powers of the leaders there. All three have cut off Western allies which previously provided both military and humanitarian aid, particularly France. Their hostility has extended to humanitarian groups, sometimes perceived as being tied to Western nations, further limiting aid.

“These military leaders are focused on economic development and they don’t even want to be seen as not being able to provide for their people … that makes it very difficult for any donors to approach them to provide help, or even for aid agencies to assess what the actual needs are,” Ochieng said.

Other African emergencies

Uganda: Although the country itself does not face large-scale internal violence, Uganda is listed because it hosts the largest number of refugees in Africa – close to two million people from neighbouring South Sudan, Sudan and the DRC. Shrinking aid, the NRC warned, could escalate friction between local communities and refugees.

Shrinking aid, the NRC warned, could escalate friction between local communities and refugees. Democratic Republic of the Congo: Decades of violence by a slew of armed groups vying to control the country’s rich deposits of minerals, and more recently, offensives by the rebel M23 group, have seen hundreds of thousands displaced in eastern DRC between 2024 and early 2025. The outbreak of Mpox in the same region in 2023 contributed to disruption. The African Union and the US are currently leading peace talks between the DRC government and neighbouring Rwanda, accused of backing M23. Other deadly attacks from groups like the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) often go unnoticed.

Somalia: Entrenched violence from the al-Shabab armed group, which has been active for decades, as well as drought, continues to displace people in the East African country. It received “dangerously low” funding in 2024, the NRC said.

Will Trump’s aid cuts further affect these crises?

US President Donald Trump’s sweeping aid cuts after he took office in January, and his decision to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the agency that distributes it, have prompted fears that humanitarian emergencies could worsen in 2025.

As the world’s biggest aid donor, the US distributed about $70bn in foreign aid yearly, particularly for healthcare. In 2024, the most aid went to Ethiopia, Jordan, DRC, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria.

With those funds either reduced or halted altogether, aid workers worry that emergencies on the African continent could worsen.

Other major donors are also making cuts, observers warn. In February, the UK cut foreign aid by 0.2 percent, while the Netherlands will slash 2.4 billion euros ($2.72bn) in aid from 2027. France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden have all announced reductions to their aid budgets since.

Hule of the NRC said the African Union (AU) must take the lead in resolving the continent’s multiple crises through political negotiations. The bloc’s Peace and Security Council, tasked with anticipating and mitigating conflict, has previously been criticised as being too slow to act.

US billionaire Bill Gates on Tuesday announced that the majority of his philanthropic Gates Foundation's $200 billion (€175 billion) endowment will be spent in Africa over the next two decades.

Gates, who on May 8 said he would wind down the foundation by 2045, made the pledge while addressing African leaders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

""I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa,"" Gates said as he urged leaders to boost health and development through partnership and innovation.

""By unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity… and that path is an exciting thing to be part of,"" Gates told government officials, diplomats and health workers.

Gates makes pitch as US government slashes aid

""Investing in primary healthcare has the greatest impact on health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""With primary healthcare, what we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results. Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference.""

US businessman-philanthropist Gates singled out Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that to his mind show strong leadership fostering innovation. He did not comment on allegations of authoritarianism and rights abuses against the governments of, for example, Ethiopia and Rwanda.

""Our foundation has an increasing commitment to Africa,"" Gates said. ""Our first African office was here in Ethiopia about 13 years ago. Now we have offices in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal. That's a great way for us to strengthen partnerships.""

Gates' pitch comes amid halts to US foreign aid on the advice of US President Donald Trump's donor and budget oversight advisor, Elon Musk — the world's richest man — who bragged of ""feeding USAID to the wood chipper.""

A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet projected that cuts to American spending on PEPFAR — the program to deliver HIV and AIDS relief abroad — could cost the lives of 500,000 children by 2030. The journal Nature suggested a sustained halt to US aid funding could result in some 25 million additional deaths over 15 years.

The Gates Foundation has invested heavily in projects aimed at reducing childhood and maternal deaths; advancing progress on vaccines for infectious disease, such as malaria or HIV; as well as lifting poor populations out of poverty.

The foundation claims that it has contributed to more than 100 innovations that have saved more than 80 million lives, citing partnerships with GAVI and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

More than meets the eye?

Despite his philanthropy, Gates has many critics around the world, increasingly so in Africa. Observers accuse him of trying to expand his economic and political power in the guise of charity. The US journalist Tim Schwab, who wrote The Bill Gates Problem, sees him as a representing philanthrocapitalism, a way of doing philanthropy similarly to how business is done for profit.

A 2022 DW documentary showed how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (as the Gates Foundation used to be called) had become one of the most important promoters of genetic engineering experiments on the African continent, thus inviting criticism that it was playing into the hands of large Western agricultural corporations.

Angolan health expert Domingos Cristovao warns African countries against becoming dependent on private foundations in key areas such as health. They should build ""their own sustainable health structures"" he says, ""without relying on foreign donors.""

Gates says 'rich should do more in philanthropy'

Gates, who made his fortune with the computer software company Microsoft and started the Gates Foundation with his ex-wife, Melinda, has urged other wealthy individuals to spend their money on humanity not just personal possessions.

When recently asked by The New York Times about why he is donating his fortune he first said, ""It makes a big difference to take the money and spend it now versus later,"" pointing to its impact on developments in agriculture and AI.

""What am I going to do?"" he added, ""Just go buy a bunch of boats or something? Go gamble? This money should go back to society in the way that it has the best chance of causing something positive to happen.""

""And I do think good examples influence other people. I think the rich people today should do more philanthropy, and we have some examples of that. And I think the rich people 20 years from now should do more in philanthropy.""

While in Africa, Gates will also meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to talk about AI and health care reform in their respective countries.

Had Adam Kredo but read George Orwell’s essay “Looking back on the Spanish War” before sitting down to write “American Adversaries Meet To 'Coordinate Their Positions' on Iran's Nuclear Program,” in The Washington Free Beacon , he might have recalled the following Orwell insight:

""…Against that …world in which black may be white tomorrow, …there are in reality only two safeguards. One is that however much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing, as it were, behind your back, and you consequently can’t violate it… The other is that so long as some parts of the earth remain unconquered, the liberal tradition can be kept alive. Let Fascism, or possibly even a combination of several Fascisms, conquer the whole world, and those two conditions no longer exist."" (My emphasis)

This was written in 1943, the kernel of Nineteen Eighty-Four already present here. This “combination of several Fascisms” has been a feature of the global landscape in various forms: since before the start of WWI with Arab intellectuals’ admiration for the “Blut und Eissen” Germans; the Bolsheviks making the German proletariat indispensable to the coming Russian Revolution; Kemal Mustafa serving as the role model for both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler; Hajj Amin Al-Husseini’s pilgrimage to Berlin via Ankara and Rome; the Communist International; the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact; the Muslim Brotherhood modelling its organisation (though not its ideology) on the Nazis; the Axis Powers; the USSR/”Democratic Peoples Republics”/national liberation fronts/the Western Left; etc.

Since they are all totalitarian, none of them can abide the existence of the others, but suppress their mutual animosity to make common cause against their mutual enemy, the world free of totalitarian dictatorship. Their mutual animosity and their common cause are in dynamic tension, alternating between dominating and submitting to the other, hence, for example, Hitler invading the Soviet Union despite the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, or even within Communism, the Sino-Soviet Split.

This same mutual animosity/common cause exists in a modified form on a larger scale when their common enemy has overwhelming military power and a reputation for using it. A clear instance of this is was when the US under Donald Trump killed ISIS caliph Abubakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Sunni jihad, in October 2019 and three months later, assassinated IRGC terror mastermind Qassim Soleimani, leader of the Shi’a jihad. Iran was radioactive, pun intended, in that its own allies were reluctant to get too close it for fear of what America might do to them.

The fearsome reputation Trump thus gained amongst all totalitarian regimes went with him into the White House in January 2025, only to immediately be eroded by none other than Donald Trump himself declaring “We want peace” and “We wanna make a deal.” Russia and China could not believe their ears, but were prudent enough to be cautious, after all, Trump and Netanyahu were getting ready to bomb Iran!

And as the months went by, they watched Trump tire of the game of kings and yearn for what he both knows best and does best, making deals. It is astonishing that the shrewd dealmaker extraordinaire could not see that Iran was stringing him along by holding out the carrot of a deal. For as long as they can play Trump, Trump will hold back Netanyahu, “because we’re so close to a deal”. What the US President doesn’t realise is that both Russia and China know exactly what Iran is up to because they do it themselves, all the time. It is how their world works.

Trump could not see Vladimir Putin was playing him for the fool in Ukraine. All that Putin needed to do is “agree to negotiate”. After Iran had tried to assassinate Trump, he started openly talking to them, saying. “They gotta make a deal. They gotta make a deal.” Even an embarrassment like Cyril Ramaphosa was inspired to think he’s got what it takes to hoodwink Trump. How much more so the serious threats like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei, who will now all step on the gas.

Americans cannot see it yet, but it is now up to Israel to save them.

This brings us to Adam Kredo’s article “American Adversaries Meet To 'Coordinate Their Positions' on Iran's Nuclear Program.” The point that Kredo misses is that Donald Trump has so eroded his reputation for tough action—oh yes, he took on the Houthis and instead of wiping them out, he made a deal with them! Similarly, instead of allowing Israel to wipe out Hamas, Trump made a deal with them, too.

The deal is Trump’s Achilles heel, one that readily steps on friends.

Iran, supposedly negotiating a nuclear deal with Trump, just combined with the other two “Fascisms,” Russia and China, to signal the weakness of the US President. “The combination of several Fascisms” now feels itself sufficiently emboldened to meet openly and flaunt that they are strategising on how to protect Iran’s nuclear facilities.

What does Donald Trump have to counter this? “A strong document.” Yeah, right. Not like the flimsy piece of paper Neville Chamberlain held up in triumph because it bore Herr Hitler’s signature. This is exactly what happens when you say to your totalitarian adversaries, “We want peace; we want to make a deal,” and you equate an “agreement” with peace, win-win, everybody’s happy, the height of pointlessness to a totalitarian mind.

All three “Fascisms”, Russia, Iran and China, used the Houthis and Hamas, i.e., the Arabs, as their canary in the coal mine. If they survive Trump, we do x; if Trump, with or without Netanyahu, wipes them out, we do y. To Muslims and communists, agreements are not part of peace, they are part of war.

Donald Trump knows what a bad deal is. The question is whether he knows there is no such thing as a good deal with Iran, Russia or China. Even now this combination of Fascisms is working out how to use Trump’s “strong document” to get closer to absolute victory over Western civilisation, in other words, destroy it utterly.

It is interesting to compare the life of Donald Trump to that of Otto von Bismarck, both great empire builders. Neither man’s early life had prepared him for state-building and both had taken on formidable tasks. The former wants to make America great; the latter pursued the same for Prussia. The defining difference between them was that while Trump is a dealmaker, Bismarck was an alliance-builder. Trump does 180s on a whim. It’s the art of the deal. Bismarck made and broke alliances, for sure, but in a long game extending over decades. The point at which Trump decides to settle has nothing to do with whatever he might have discussed with anyone before he joined the negotiating table. Bismarck had to think of who had what interests before he started negotiating, and who might respond how to whatever he decides to settle on.

To be clear, Bismarck’s statecraft was probably a great deal more manipulative than Trump’s dealmaking, yet while the businessman’s mindset escapes many of the pressures and constraints of politics, he lacks the patient multi-level strategising towards a longterm viable goal. It is telling that Trump is unable to pick up the Abraham Accords where he left off, reduced to quietly asking Muhammad bin Salman to join the Accords as a personal favour to him, at least, that’s the rumour.

It is not necessary for Trump to think beyond the deal, and those who depend on him politically, especially in foreign relations, may find him here today and gone tomorrow. It’s just business. Bismarck ended up entirely redrawing the map of Europe, and orchestrated the drawing of the first colonial map of Africa as a necessary adjunct to making Prussia great, despite the extremely modest colonial possessions in it for Prussia. This is not something a dealmaker could have achieved. Trump might well end up making America great again, but at what cost to his allies?

Something else could additionally be at play to account for Trump’s fickle behaviour. Exactly how many separate deals has the Muslim Brotherhood amassed in America, and how much power does it wield through their cumulative effect, including through its agent, Qatar, and its fifth column within NATO, Turkey?

A different pressure, one not in the public eye, might be bearing down on Trump. When Donald Trump admitted on camera that it was “not appropriate” at this time for Israel to destroy an existential threat hanging over her, Trump’s body language was not that of triumph for having tied down Iran, but of shame. There is more to Donald Trump’s evasion than just evading eye contact.

Mitchell Bard, in an article titled “Et tu, Rubio?” in JNS , provides an alarming list of Trump’s actions “undeniably” detrimental to Israel. These include:

He forced Israel into ceasefires with both Hamas and Hezbollah.

He has, like former President Biden, micromanaged aspects of Israel’s wars with Hezbollah and Hamas, as when he warned Israel not to target infrastructure in Beirut and delay “Operation Gideon’s Chariots” in Gaza.

He imposed a 17% tariff on Israeli imports, effectively punishing one of America’s closest allies.

He eliminated USAID funding for Israel when he dismantled the agency.

He legitimized negotiations with jihadist enemies of Israel and their supporters—the ISIS leader of Syria, the Islamist president of Turkey, the Hamas-sponsoring Qatari emir, and the Iranian mullahs—while offering Israel nothing in return.

He initiated direct talks with Hamas, reversing decades of bipartisan American policy that refused to legitimize the terror group.

We agree with Bard that Donald Trump is effectively doing an Obama on Israel, albeit without Obama’s evil intent. Eventually, Israel will have no choice, but to go it alone in dealing with Iran as she sees fit. Strictly speaking, thus has it ever been. The longer Israel waits, the more Trump will harden against any Israeli action at all. As soon a Trump has his precious deal, Action!—unless, of course, the deal includes the US protecting Iran against Israel, exactly where we were with Obama. It is safer for Israel to assume such is indeed the case. This brings us to the link between, “We must defend ourselves by ourselves,” and George Orwell’s “…so long as some parts of the earth remain unconquered, the liberal tradition can be kept alive.”

To remind the reader of Orwell’s insight brought above: ""…Against that …world in which black may be white tomorrow, …there are in reality only two safeguards. One is that however much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing, as it were, behind your back, and you consequently can’t violate it… The other is that so long as some parts of the earth remain unconquered, the liberal tradition can be kept alive. Let Fascism, or possibly even a combination of several Fascisms, conquer the whole world, and those two conditions no longer exist. (My emphasis)

It is civilisation’s survival imperative that Israel defend herself by herself. Israel’s presumption has to be that there is no one who will defend her or come to her aid. Already we live in a “world in which black may be white tomorrow.”

-The Palestinian Arabs attempt a genocide in Israel; the world accuses Israel of genocide of the Palestinian Arabs.

-Israel sends convoys of food into Gaza; the world accuses Israel of starving the Gazans.

-Israel goes above and beyond the requirements of International Law; the ICC issues arrest warrants for war crimes against Israel’s leaders.

This list of denials by counter-accusation is long and a communist speciality. The point is that just because “however much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing... behind your back, and you consequently can’t violate it,” does not stop the denials. In those parts of the earth already conquered, such as entire generations in most of the free world, those denials become psychological attacks on the people in those parts of the earth that remain unconquered, in this case, Israel.

Only Israel stands between “a combination of several Fascisms conquer[ing] the whole world,” and the obliteration of “those two conditions” by which “the liberal tradition” is preserved. The alternative is “a boot stamping on a human face—forever.” It is an alternative that does not have to come to pass if this unconquered part of the earth recognises her unshakeable allies: everyone that Islam considers “enemies of Allah,” i.e., everyone that Muslims persecute - Christians, Druze, Yazidis, Zoroastrians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc., but especially former Muslims, Israel’s most important and least recognised allies.

Kowtowing to the fickle and appeasing Muslims are not the only ways of avoiding isolation; embracing the steadfast is another.

I had the same understanding of the Pax Americana that has existed since the end of World War II. Although America did not create a geographic and political empire in the way the Romans did, we took it upon ourselves to keep the peace around as much of the world as possible, allowing trade to flourish. The trade certainly benefited us, but it also came at a price, for we funded the free world’s wars against communism, both with blood and treasure.

One would think that enabling large swaths of the world to remain free, and fighting and/or funding their wars, would be enough. However, according to leftists, it’s not enough.

As we’ve long heard, America also has a moral obligation to accept the illegal entry of every person in the world who finds him or herself living in a dysfunctional Third World country—dysfunctional, I might add, through no fault of the American people.

Just the other day, Monica Showalter wrote about the latest anti-Elon Musk narrative: DOGE, by finding wasteful spending, has killed 300,000 people. No, not just people. He’s killed 300,000 children!

As it turned out, there were no instant deaths; only projected ones. And we know this because Brooke Nichol, who holds the title of associate professor of global health at Boston University, set up an “Impact Metrics Dashboard,” which purports to show all the people who will die, thanks to USAID’s closed checkbook.

I’m impressed that Nichols knows with so much certainty that every USAID dollar was and will be well-spent on the claimed health projects. The reality is that most evidence, both hard and anecdotal, says otherwise, with graft and wokism siphoning off huge sums of money, but that’s a subject for another post.

In any event, solely for the sake of this essay, I’m going to accept as true the claims that Nichols’s little dashboard makes. Without our money, she says, tens of millions of people of all ages around the world will die in the next five years from malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhea, malnutrition, pneumonia, neglected tropical diseases, etc.

My question for you, and it’s a serious one, is how great is our obligation to provide healthcare to the world’s poor? Once, I know that this was considered to be something of a moral personal obligation, especially amongst Christians, who donated money for various health-related missionary programs. But do we as a nation bear this obligation that taxpayers must be forced to fund at the point of a gun?

I value human life, I really do. And as a parent, I recognize how vulnerable children are, and don’t even want to think about the horror of losing a child. I am grateful every day that I was able to raise my children in America rather than in an impoverished country.

The brief freeze and rapid partial reinstatement of National Endowment for Democracy (NED) funding in early 2025 helped expose it as a US regime-change tool. Created to rebrand CIA covert operations as “democracy promotion,” the NED channels government funds to opposition groups, meddling in their internal affairs.

Regime change on the US agenda

In 2018, Kenneth Wollack bragged to the US Congress that the NED had given political training to 8,000 young Nicaraguans, many of whom were engaged in a failed attempt to overthrow Nicaragua’s Sandinista government. Wollack was praising the “democracy-promotion” work carried out by NED, of which he is now vice-chair. Carl Gershman, then president of the NED and giving evidence, was asked about Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, who had been re-elected with an increased majority two years prior. He responded: “Time for him to go.”

Seven years later, Trump took office and it looked as if the NED’s future was endangered. On February 12, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Elon Musk froze disbursement of its congressionally approved funds. Its activities stopped and its website went blank. On February 24, Richard Grenell, special envoy to Venezuela, declared that “Donald Trump is someone who does not want to make regime changes.”

Washington’s global regime-change operations were immediately impacted and over 2,000 paid US collaborating organizations temporarily defunded. A Biden-appointed judge warned of “potentially catastrophic harm” to (not in her words) US efforts to overturn foreign governments. The howl from the corporate press was deafening. The Associated Press cried: “‘Beacon of freedom’ dims as US initiatives that promote democracy abroad wither.”

However, the pause lasted barely a month. On March 10, funding was largely reinstated. The NED, which “deeply appreciated” the State Department’s volte face, then made public its current program which, in Latin America and the Caribbean alone, includes over 260 projects costing more than $40 million.

US “soft power”

Created in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan following scandals involving the CIA’s covert funding of foreign interventions, the NED was to shift such operations into a more publicly palatable form under the guise of “democracy promotion.” As Allen Weinstein, NED’s first acting president, infamously admitted in 1991: “A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.” In short, NED functions as a “soft power arm” of US foreign policy.

The NED disingenuously operates as a 501(c)(3) private nonprofit foundation. However, it is nearly 100% funded by annual appropriations from the US Congress and governed mainly by Washington officials or ex-officials. In reality, it is an instrument of the US state—and, arguably, of the so-called deep state. But its quasi-private status shields it from many of the disclosure requirements that typically apply to taxpayer-funded agencies.

Hence we encounter verbal gymnastics such as those in its “Duty of Care and Public Disclosure Policies.” That document loftily proclaims: “NED holds itself to high standards of transparency and accountability.” Under a discussion of its “legacy” (with no mention of its CIA pedigree), the NGO boasts: “Transparency has always been central to NED’s identity.”

But it continues, “…transparency for oversight differs significantly from transparency for public consumption.” In other words, it is transparent to the State Department but not to the public. The latter are only offered what it euphemistically calls a “curated public listing of grants” – highly redacted and lacking in specific details.

NED enjoys a number of advantages by operating in the nether region between an accountable US government agency and a private foundation. It offers plausible deniability: the US government can use it to support groups doing its bidding abroad without direct attribution, giving Washington a defense from accusations of interference in the internal affairs of other countries. It is also more palatable for foreign institutions to partner with what is ostensibly an NGO, rather than with the US government itself.

The NED can also respond quickly if regime-change initiatives are needed in countries on Washington’s enemy list, circumventing the usual governmental budgeting procedures. And, as illustrated during that congressional presentation in 2018 on Nicaragua, NED’s activities are framed as supporting democracy, human rights, and civil society. It cynically invokes universal liberal values while promoting narrow Yankee geopolitical interests. Thus its programs are sold as altruistic rather than imperial, and earn positive media headlines like the one from the AP cited above.

But a look at NED’s work in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba suggests very much the opposite.

Venezuela

Venezuela had passed an NGO Oversight Law in 2024. Like the US’s Foreign Agents Registration Act, but somewhat less restrictive, the law requires certification of NGOs. As even the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) – an inside-the-beltway promoter of US imperialism with a liberal gloss – admits: “Many Venezuelan organizations receiving US support have not been public about being funding recipients.”

The pace of Washington’s efforts in Venezuela temporarily slowed with the funding pause, as US-funded proxies had to focus on their own survival. Venezuelan government officials, cheering the pause, viewed the NED’s interference in their internal affairs as a violation of Venezuelan sovereignty. In contrast, the US-funded leader of the far-right opposition, Maria Corina Machado, begged for international support to make up for the shortfall from Washington.

WOLA bemoaned that the funding freeze allowed the “Maduro government to further delegitimize NGOs” paid by the US. Hundreds of US-funded organizations, they lamented, “now face the grim choice of going underground, relocating abroad, or shutting down operations altogether.”

With the partial reinstatement of funding, now bankrolling at least 39 projects costing $3.4 million, former US senator and present NED board member Mel Martinez praised the NED for its “tremendous presence in Venezuela… supporting the anti-Maduro movement.”

Nicaragua

Leading up to the 2018 coup attempt, the NED had funded 54 projects worth over $4 million. Much of this went to support supposedly “independent” media, in practice little more than propaganda outlets for Nicaragua’s opposition groups. Afterward, the NED-funded online magazine Global Americansrevealed that the NED had “laid “the groundwork for insurrection” in Nicaragua.

One of the main beneficiaries, Confidencial, is owned by the Chamorro family, two of whose members later announced intentions to stand in Nicaragua’s 2021 elections. The family received well over $5 million in US government funding, either from the NED or directly from USAID (now absorbed into the State Department). In 2022, Cristiana Chamorro, who handled much of this funding, was found guilty of money laundering. Her eight-year sentence was commuted to house arrest; after a few months she was given asylum in the US.

Of the 22 Nicaragua-related projects which NED has resumed funding, one third sponsor “independent” media. While the recipients’ names are undisclosed, it is almost certain that this funding is either for outlets like Confidencial (now based in Costa Rica), or else is going direct to leading opponents of the Sandinista government to pay for advertisements currently appearing in Twitter and other social media.

Cuba

In Latin America, Cuba is targeted with the highest level of NED spending – $6.6 million covering 46 projects. One stated objective is to create “a more well-informed, critically minded citizenry,” which appears laughable to anyone who has been to Cuba and talked to ordinary people there – generally much better informed about world affairs than a typical US citizen.

Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno criticized the NED’s destabilizing activities, such as financing 54 anti-Cuba organizations since 2017. He advised the US administration to review “how many in that country [the US] have enriched themselves organizing destabilization and terrorism against Cuba with support from that organization.”

Washington not only restored NED funding for attacks on Cuba but, on May 15, added Cuba to the list of countries that “do not fully cooperate with its anti-terrorist efforts.”

The NED: Covert influence in the name of democracy

Anyone with a basic familiarity with the Washington’s workings is likely to be aware of the NED’s covert role. Yet the corporate media – behaving as State Department stenographers and showing no apparent embarrassment – have degenerated to the point where they regularly portray the secretly funded NED outlets as “independent” media serving the targeted countries.

Case in point: Washington Post columnist Max Boot finds it “sickening” that Trump is “trying [to] end US government support for democracy abroad.” He is concerned because astroturf “democracy promotion groups” cannot exist without the flow of US government dollars. He fears the “immense tragedy” of Trump’s executive order to cut off funding (now partially reinstated) for the US Agency for Global Media, the parent agency of the Voice of America, Radio Marti, and other propaganda outlets.

Behind the moralistic appeals to democracy promotion and free press is a defense of the US imperial project to impose itself on countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. Those sanctioned countries, targeted for regime change, need free access to food, fuel, medicines and funding for development. They don’t need to hear US propaganda beamed to them or generated locally by phonily “independent” media.",2025-06-03 02:45:00+00:00,https://www.activistpost.com/us-reinstates-funding-to-propaganda-outlet-ned/,

Paperwork with the word ""USAID"" was found in the car of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who's accused of allegedly throwing explosives at a group in Boulder, Colorado, peacefully protesting for the release of Hamas' hostages.

The incident happened on Sunday as the pro-Israel group ""Run for Their Lives"" was protesting on Pearl Street. Boulder police said eight people were injured in the alleged terror attack, adding that they initially received reports of a man setting people on fire.

According to an arrest affidavit, law enforcement officials found paperwork with the words ""USAID"" inside Soliman's 2015 silver Toyota Prius. Other paperwork with the words ""Israel"" and ""Palestine"" was also allegedly found inside the Toyota Prius, in addition to a red gas container and rags.

A senior State Department official told Fox News Digital that Soliman isn't a United States Agency for International Development employee.

Soliman allegedly told federal and local law enforcement officials during an interview that he specifically targeted a ""Zionist group"" that gathered in Boulder on June 1 because he wanted to stop them from taking over ""our land,"" which he said is ""Palestine."" Soliman allegedly said he was planning the attack for a year, adding he waited until his daughter graduated.

A newspaper with an article about DOGE would qualify as “paperwork with the word USAID.” Half the country has “paperwork with the word USAID.” The reporter couldn’t be bothered to get more specific info? Did he run an NGO or work for one connected to USAID, or did he just have a subscription to Newsweek mentioning USAID work in Gaza, write a poetic ode to USAID, date someone at USAID, or what?

Was tun, wenn Geld so selbstverständlich wie Luft zum Atmen ist? Der Tech-Milliardär Bill Gates hat für sich eine Antwort gefunden: verschenken. Jetzt ist auch klar, an wen.

Bill Gates darf sich schon länger sicher sein: Eine warme Mahlzeit am Tag kann er sich bis an sein Lebensende leisten. Derzeit belegt der Microsoft-Gründer Platz 13 auf der Liste des Magazins ""Fortune"" der reichsten Menschen des Planeten. 116,5 Milliarden Dollar soll der 69-Jährige angehäuft haben.

Doch, wenn es nach ihm geht (und das tut es), soll eines Tages nicht etwa seine Familie, sondern ein ganzer Kontinent den Großteil seines Vermögens erben.

Bill Gates will fast 200 Milliarden Dollar in Afrika ""investieren""

In den kommenden 20 Jahren will er seine Milliarden für die Verbesserung der Bildungs- und Gesundheitsdienste in Afrika stecken. Durch die ""die Entfaltung des menschlichen Potenzials"" solle ""jedes Land in Afrika auf den Weg zum Wohlstand gebracht werden"", zitiert seine Wohltätigkeitsorganisation, die Gates Foundation, ihn aus einer Rede, die er am Montag in Äthiopiens Hauptstadt Addis Abeba hielt. ""Der Großteil dieser Mittel wird dafür verwendet werden, Sie bei der Bewältigung der Herausforderungen hier in Afrika zu unterstützen"", sagte er vor 12.000 Menschen im Hauptquartier der Afrikanischen Union.

Dass der bekannte Unternehmer seine Milliarden in den kommenden zwei Jahrzehnten fast restlos verschenken will, hatte er bereits Mitte Mai angekündigt – wohin war allerdings bisher unklar. Wenn seine Stiftung 2045 planmäßig ihre Arbeit einstellte, wolle er 99 Prozent seiner bis dahin geschätzten 200 Milliarden Dollar spenden.

Afrika hat mit zurückgehender US-Entwicklungshilfe

Für viele afrikanische Länder könnte Gates Versprechen zu kaum einem besseren Zeitpunkt kommen. Seit US-Präsident Donald Trump die Hilfsgelder seiner Entwicklungsbehörde USAID massiv gekürzt hat, ist untere anderem die Versorgung von Millionen HIV-Patienten unklar.

Gates Geld soll vor allem in die Entwicklung der Gesundheitssysteme fließen. Gleichzeitig rief er junge afrikanische Investoren auf, im Gesundheitssektor stark auf Künstliche Intelligenz zu setzen. Die Gates Foundation gab selbst drei Prioritäten bekannt: die Sterberate von Müttern und Neugeborenen reduzieren, tödliche Infektionskrankheiten bekämpfen und Millionen Afrikaner aus der Armut helfen.

Familie Gates bleibt steinreich

Gates, der Mitte der 70er-Jahre gemeinsam mit Paul Allen Microsoft gegründet hatte, hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren Schritt für Schritt aus der Leitung seines Tech-Imperiums verabschiedet.

Gates hatte erklärt, durch das vom amerikanischen Industriellen 1889 verfasste Essay ""The Gospel of Wealth"" (Das Evangelium des Reichtums) zur Wohltätigkeit inspiriert worden zu sein. Darin heißt es: ""Wer reich stirbt, stirbt in Schande.""

Aber, was auch passiert: Seine Familie geht keineswegs leer aus. Selbst wenn er zu seinem Tod wie angekündigt bereits 99 Prozent seiner Milliarden verschenkt hat, sind die Gates-Nachkommen immer noch Milliardäre.

""Die Leute werden viel über mich sagen, wenn ich sterbe, aber ich bin entschlossen, dass 'er starb, als er reich war' nicht dazu gehören wird"", schrieb er in einem Blogbeitrag Anfang Mai.

Michael Saylor is the high priest of the bitcoin Crusade, and he is unstoppable. He’s like a runaway train, which refuses to stop.

Why the future looks so bright

So the reason why the future looks so bright is manyfold:

First, it looks like the bitcoin turbo lag is starting to kick in, MSTR, and my 2X levered MSTU is starting to pick up speed. The bitcoin conference just finished in Vegas, with JD Vance, the vice president speaking… I actually really like JD Vance, I think he will be a great candidate for the next president.

Anyways, I think we are in this funny new world in which there is certainly a new world order emerging. Everyone is trying to scramble to figure out what’s happening next.

First, it looks like America, in China, are starting to pull out of foreign places. For example in Cambodia, here in Phnom Penh, there has been a mass exodus of American NGO or aid workers, USAID, ￼pulling out. I was talking to a lady, Australian lady, and she told me that actually she knew at least like 13 to 15 American families, who worked here for like 15 years, sponsored by the US government, they all had to leave and move back to the states.

Even China, he started all these mega construction projects in Cambodia, but even they are pulling out because I think there are some economic turmoil back home. And also apparently, talking to a successful local Cambodian entrepreneur, saying how rich Chinese citizens cannot even pull out more than $10,000 USD out of China. And apparently, yes I am not joking… This is not a typo, buying a small one bedroom apartment condo in Shanghai is like $100 million USD. Not a typo, $100 million USD for a single condo, a small one… One bedroom, in the heart of Shanghai.

What’s the issue? Once again… If you have controls, then… Obviously the price of scarce desirable things like real estate will skyrocket to insane Heights because there is nothing else one could park their money into.

Like for example… Imagine you are like a Chinese billionaire, making $10 billion a year. But you cannot pull out a measly $10,000 USD from the country, which is like a used Toyota Prius, so where is your money going to go? After you have bought all the fancy cars, you’re probably not going to want to store it in Chinese Yuan, Because you know that it is a dying asset. Instead, you’re probably going to put it into real estate, or gold. But the problem is also… It is difficult to sneak gold out of a country. Try taking 100 gold bars in your check on luggage, Trying to escape to Vancouver.

I mean if I was a rich mainland Chinese person, ￼ I would try to figure out how I could convert all my wealth into bitcoin. Same thing with any rich international person who is not American.

Even some other very exciting things, apparently one of the head honcho, who might become like the next British Prime Minister or something, he himself wants to build some sort of strategic bitcoin reserve?

Internet, digital, cyber supremacy

So it looks like at this point, people are tired of war. No more Saddam Hussein, no more nuclear holocaust, no more World War III. Everybody, Russian Chinese Ukrainian, American, South Africa Africans alike, everyone wants to keep their Rolls-Royce, wants to keep their iPhone pros, want their kids to be in some sort of nice international school, learning English, And they want to keep their fine whiskey, take occasional trips to Japan etc.

As a consequence, the incentives of all of the all the oligarchs of the planet, the truth is everybody wants peace and stability. Nobody desires physical war, in which guns bombs and humans are killed.

Even being here in Cambodia, in which like 99% of the intellectual class was literally massacre, either killed with machetes and guns, literally just because you wear glasses, did not look Cambodian Khmer, if you had a flushing toilet at home, had a watch, etc. And all the young Cambodians, I think the average, median age for a Cambodian person is only 25 years old, nobody wants us to ever ever ever happen again. Everyone all the young kids, they want to look like Korean popular idols, BTS or BLACKPINK, Lisa or Jenny,Suka, etc.

Everyone desires economic prosperity

The simple logic, once you no longer become a single disenchanted, tech worker, once you quit Reddit, Google incognito, etc. Everyone wants a greater more prosperous economic future for their children, themselves, their family.

I think the difficult thing about being a single person, especially as a single male… Literally like 100% of the stuff on the Internet is just fear pornography.

What does that mean? This means that there is actually an economic and financial incentive powered by ChatGPT AI and bots, to create fake views, hate, etc.

Even accidentally using some sort of ChatGPT search, in which literally like 100% of the information it’s just plain false, like literally just made up from the ether, provokes some sort of anger?

AI is bad.

How to thrive in today’s brave new world?

Whether he actually leaves Washington or not, Democrats need to make sure that the next time they’re in power they hold him accountable for his disastrous tenure.

Before coming to Washington, Musk promised to deliver, via DOGE, at least $1 trillion in government savings. The billionaire delivered only a small fraction of that, and left a legacy, in the words of the New York Times’s Michelle Goldberg, of “disease, starvation, and death.”

A politics of no consequences is having dangerous and far-reaching effects.

As I detail in my recent book, Musk’s far-right politics complement his self-messianic view that only he can solve the problems facing the U.S. As his purchase and subsequent degradation of Twitter showed, this drive is stymied by his poor management and worse ideas. But at DOGE, operating with the backing of the president, he has been unconstrained by more rational actors.

The resulting attack on the federal government left agencies across the administration in chaos. DOGE’s assault on USAID in particular will have deadly ramifications on the world’s least fortunate for years, if not decades. Federal regulators in positions that could affect Musk’s businesses have been defunded, removed or otherwise cowed.

The full extent of the damage is still to be determined. DOGE smashed the walls put in place between agencies to protect the privacy of Americans and made it easier for federal officials to achieve full spectrum dominance of personal information. That information, in turn, is soon to be managed by the data processing and surveillance firm Palantir, a company co-founded by Musk ally Peter Thiel.

This raises a dilemma for Democrats if they retake Congress in 2026 and the White House in 2028: Since Musk continues to hold considerable influence in the executive branch, what should they do about this man’s destructive behavior if they retake power in the future?

The last two times Democrats won the White House, their victories came on the back of popular discontent with the incumbent GOP administration. In both cases, the Democratic base and the general public hoped that the new administration would take some action to hold their predecessors accountable. But that was not the case.

In January of 2009, incoming President Barack Obama rejected calls to investigate Bush administration programs such as domestic eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. “We need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards,” he told George Stephanopoulos just before taking office. And despite entering office just after the 2008 financial crisis, Obama’s administration declined to interrogate big banks’ culpability in the collapse.

Trump’s second administration has struck numerous blows against the rule of law and accountability.

For Biden, the need at the moment of his inauguration for criminal investigation and prosecution of Trump couldn’t have been clearer. After inciting a riot on Jan. 6, 2021, with dark warnings of election fraud and exhortations to a belligerent crowd to “fight like hell,” Trump was impeached — but too late to be removed from office. Biden could have directed the Justice Department to aggressively pursue justice against Trump, but instead appointed a slow-moving attorney general who seemed disinterested in taking decisive action and lost the momentum.

Today, Trump is acting with impunity, confident the law will not apply to him. Bolstered by a Supreme Court that has effectively delivered him carte blanche, the president is tearing the country’s political structures apart and remaking the nation in his far-right image. A politics of no consequences is having dangerous and far-reaching effects.

That’s exactly the attitude the country can’t afford from the opposition party at this pivotal moment in American history. In order to move forward, we’ll need to clean up the past.

Party leaders can jumpstart this new approach to wielding power with how they treat Musk. At the state level, Democratic lawmakers in states like California and New York should immediately begin dig into Musk’s malfeasance and how his companies have taken advantage of lax regulations and loopholes. Even in red states, there are opportunities to push state legislatures in Tennessee, Texas and Florida to at least confront how the billionaire’s business practices are damaging local environments, making people sick and leaving the public worse off than before his arrival.

If Democrats retake the House or Senate, they’ll need to investigate what exactly the billionaire did with DOGE and how his management of it damaged U.S. interests. They should investigate his federal contracts and the extent to which the Trump White House funneled business his way — as may have happened with India and other nations negotiating trade deals with the administration. Televised hearings can put pressure on their colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the White House; once they’re back in power, Democrats should pursue criminal investigations.

In just a few months, Trump’s second administration has struck numerous blows against the rule of law and accountability. Should Democrats regain some measure of political power, they need to be ready to exercise it in the interests of the American people, ensuring that rule breaking and illegal acts are kept in check — and not allowing prior lawlessness to go unpunished. Musk is an easy, and worthy, target to start with. Democrats should use his record as a springboard to regain power and, once they have it, to put the rich and powerful on notice that this time the party intends to serve the public.",2025-06-02 22:11:49+00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-doge-democrats-accountable-trump-administration-rcna210373,

2 junho 2025

Um ""fluxo de vítimas em massa"", muitas com ferimentos de bala ou estilhaços, deu entrada em um hospital de campanha da Cruz Vermelha no sul de Gaza, informou a organização, em meio a relatos conflitantes sobre um incidente próximo a um centro de distribuição de ajuda humanitária em Rafah.

Trinta e uma pessoas foram mortas e mais de 200 foram feridas por Israel, de acordo com o Ministério da Saúde de Gaza, administrado pelo Hamas, e o gabinete de comunicação do governo, que em uma atualização posterior disse que uma pessoa também foi morta perto de um centro de ajuda humanitária distinto na região da Ponte de Wadi Gaza.

Mas as Forças de Defesa de Israel (IDF, na sigla em inglês) afirmaram que ""as conclusões de um inquérito inicial indicam que as IDF não dispararam contra civis"".

Posteriormente, também divulgaram imagens de drones que, segundo a organização, mostravam homens armados e mascarados atirando pedras e disparando contra civis enquanto coletavam ajuda humanitária na cidade vizinha de Khan Younis. A BBC não pôde confirmar independentemente a veracidade das imagens.

A BBC foi contatada por médicos do Hospital Nasser, em Khan Younis, que contaram ter recebido cerca de 200 pessoas com ferimentos causados por balas ou estilhaços.

Um soldado das IDF em Rafah entrou em contato com a BBC para dizer que os soldados israelenses atiraram perto da multidão, mas não contra ela, e que ninguém foi atingido.

Mohammed Ghareeb, jornalista em Rafah, afirmou à BBC que os palestinos haviam se reunido perto do centro de distribuição de ajuda humanitária administrado pela Fundação Humanitária de Gaza (GHF, na sigla em inglês) quando os tanques israelenses se aproximaram e abriram fogo contra a multidão.

A GHF é um grupo de ajuda humanitária controverso apoiado por Israel e pelos Estados Unidos. Mas quem é exatamente a GHF?

Como a GHF planeja fornecer ajuda a Gaza?

O programa da GHF tem sido alvo de críticas e escrutínio.

O grupo, que usa agentes de segurança americanos armados, tem como objetivo substituir a Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) como principal fornecedor de ajuda humanitária para os 2,1 milhões de habitantes em Gaza, onde especialistas alertaram sobre a iminência de fome após um bloqueio israelense de 11 semanas, que foi recentemente flexibilizado.

Pelo mecanismo da GHF, os palestinos devem coletar caixas contendo alimentos e itens básicos de higiene para suas famílias em quatro locais de distribuição no sul e no centro de Gaza.

Os locais vão estar protegidos por prestadores de serviço americanos, com tropas israelenses patrulhando os perímetros. Para ter acesso, os palestinos devem se submeter a controle de identidade e triagem por meio de biometria e reconhecimento facial para verificar envolvimento com o Hamas.

Mas muitos detalhes logísticos ainda não foram explicados.

Por que a ONU, as agências humanitárias e o Hamas são contra esse plano?

A ONU e muitos grupos de ajuda humanitária se recusaram a cooperar com os planos da GHF, que, segundo eles, contradizem os princípios humanitários e parecem ""transformar a ajuda em uma arma"".

Um porta-voz da ONU afirmou que a operação da GHF era uma ""distração do que é realmente necessário"", e pediu a Israel que reabrisse todas as passagens.

A ONU e outras agências de ajuda humanitária insistiram que não vão cooperar com nenhum esquema que não respeite os princípios humanitários fundamentais.

Elas advertiram que o sistema da GHF vai praticamente excluir as pessoas com problemas de mobilidade, incluindo aquelas com ferimentos, deficiências e idosos, forçar mais desalojamento, expor milhares de pessoas a danos, condicionar a ajuda a objetivos políticos e militares, e estabelecer um precedente inaceitável para a prestação de ajuda humanitária no mundo todo.

Jan Egeland, secretário-geral do Conselho Norueguês para Refugiados e ex-chefe humanitário da ONU, descreveu a GHF como ""militarizada, privatizada e politizada"".

""As pessoas por trás dela são militares — ex-agentes da CIA, ex-agentes de segurança. Há uma empresa de segurança que vai trabalhar em estreita colaboração com uma das partes do conflito armado, as Forças de Defesa de Israel"", disse ele à BBC no fim de maio. ""Eles vão ter alguns centros... onde as pessoas serão selecionadas de acordo com as necessidades de um dos lados do conflito — Israel.""

""Não podemos permitir que uma parte do conflito decida onde, como e quem vai receber a ajuda"", acrescentou.

O Hamas advertiu os palestinos a não cooperarem com o sistema da GHF, dizendo que ele ""substituiria a ordem pelo caos, imporia uma política de fome planejada aos civis palestinos, e usaria os alimentos como arma em tempos de guerra"".

A declaração da GHF alega que o Hamas também fez ""ameaças de morte contra grupos de ajuda humanitária que apoiam operações humanitárias nos locais de distribuição segura da GHF, além de esforços para impedir que a população de Gaza tenha acesso à ajuda nos locais"".

Israel afirma que é necessária uma alternativa ao atual sistema de ajuda humanitária para impedir que o Hamas roube a ajuda, o que o grupo nega fazer.

Em um desdobramento que aumentou as suspeitas sobre a GHF, seu diretor, Jake Wood, renunciou ao cargo no fim de maio por discordar dos métodos usados pela organização.

Quem é Jake Wood e por que ele renunciou?

Wood, ex-fuzileiro naval dos EUA, disse que foi procurado para liderar a GHF há dois meses, devido à sua experiência em operações humanitárias. Mas, há uma semana, ele informou que estava deixando o cargo devido ao seu desconforto com o plano apoiado por Israel.

""Como muitas outras pessoas ao redor do mundo, fiquei horrorizado e arrasado com a crise de fome em Gaza e, como líder humanitário, fui compelido a fazer o que podia para ajudar a aliviar o sofrimento"", afirmou ele na declaração em que anunciou a renúncia.

Ele disse que estava ""orgulhoso do trabalho que supervisionei, incluindo o desenvolvimento de um plano pragmático que poderia alimentar pessoas famintas, abordar as preocupações de segurança sobre o desvio, e complementar o trabalho de ONGs de longa data em Gaza"".

Mas, segundo ele, havia ficado ""claro que não é possível implementar esse plano e, ao mesmo tempo, respeitar rigorosamente os princípios humanitários de humanidade, neutralidade, imparcialidade e independência, que não vou abandonar"".

Em resposta, a GHF afirmou que ""não seria dissuadida"" pela renúncia de Wood, e começaria a entregar ajuda na segunda-feira, com o objetivo de alcançar um milhão de palestinos até o fim da semana.

O grupo disse que os críticos ""que se beneficiam do status quo têm se concentrado mais em destruir isso do que em obter ajuda, com medo de que soluções novas e criativas para problemas insolúveis possam realmente dar certo"".

John Acree, ex-gerente da USAID — a agência do governo dos EUA responsável pela administração da ajuda internacional — foi nomeado diretor executivo interino.

Qual é a gravidade da situação no local?

Israel impôs um bloqueio total à ajuda humanitária para Gaza em 2 de março, e retomou sua ofensiva militar duas semanas depois, encerrando um cessar-fogo de dois meses com o Hamas.

O governo israelense disse que as medidas tinham o objetivo de pressionar o grupo armado a libertar os 58 reféns ainda mantidos em Gaza, dos quais acredita-se que 23 estejam vivos.

Em 19 de maio, o Exército israelense lançou uma ofensiva ampliada que, segundo o primeiro-ministro, Benjamin Netanyahu, levaria as tropas a ""assumir o controle de todas as áreas"" de Gaza. O plano, segundo informações, incluiria a remoção completa de civis do norte e o deslocamento forçado para o sul.

Netanyahu também disse que Israel aliviaria temporariamente o bloqueio e permitiria a entrada de uma quantidade ""básica"" de alimentos em Gaza para evitar a fome, após pressão de aliados nos EUA.

Desde então, as autoridades israelenses afirmam ter permitido a entrada em Gaza de pelo menos 665 caminhões de ajuda humanitária, incluindo farinha, comida para bebê e suprimentos médicos.

No entanto, o chefe do Programa Mundial de Alimentos da ONU alertou recentemente que a ajuda era apenas uma ""gota no oceano"" do que era necessário no território para reverter os níveis catastróficos de fome, em meio à escassez significativa de alimentos básicos e à disparada dos preços.

Meio milhão de pessoas correm o risco de passar fome nos próximos meses, de acordo com uma avaliação da Classificação Integrada de Fases da Segurança Alimentar (IPC, na sigla em inglês), apoiada pela ONU.

""El presidente se extralimitó en sus funciones. La ley no confiere una autoridad ilimitada para regular el comercio exterior mediante aranceles"". Eso es lo que dicen los tres jueces de la Corte de Comercio Internacional, con sede en Nueva York, que han tumbado la política arancelaria del presidente de EEUU, Donald Trump, que ya adelanta una dura batalla judicial.

De momento, el Tribunal de Apelaciones ha anulado el fallo temporalmente a petición de la Casa Blanca y, previsiblemente, el caso terminará llegando al Supremo, ampliamente controlado por Trump, ya que se trata del presidente que más magistrados ha nominado del alto tribunal estadounidense.

Si los recursos no prosperan, la sentencia de la Corte de Comercio tendría que aplicarse y no deja lugar a segundas lecturas ni interpretaciones: ""Las órdenes arancelarias impugnadas serán anuladas y se prohibirá permanentemente su aplicación"".

Se trataría, sin duda, del golpe judicial más importante para la Casa Blanca en el segundo mandato de Trump, en la medida en que gran parte de los primeros meses se han centrado en impulsar una ofensiva arancelaria sin precedentes en la historia reciente del país y la promesa de una ""lluvia de miles de millones de dólares"" cobrados a sus hasta ahora grandes socios comerciales para que ""EEUU vuelva a ser rico otra vez"".

Pero ese argumento no lo compra la Corte de Comercio Internacional, al menos, no desde un punto de vista legal. Para saltarse el control del Congreso, Trump necesita demostrar que realmente corre peligro la seguridad nacional de EEUU para poder imponer aranceles a discreción y desatar una guerra comercial que ni siquiera beneficia a la mayor economía del planeta.

Mientras, los abogados de la Casa Blanca trabajan a contrarreloj para que su recurso prospere o, en el peor de los casos, recurrir a otras leyes para intentar justificar la agenda del presidente norteamericano.

Trabajo no les falta y las resoluciones judiciales en su contra se acumulan en tiempo récord y van mucho más allá del ámbito comercial y de los aranceles. Los tribunales estadounidenses tumban las órdenes presidenciales casi con la misma velocidad con la que Trump las firma. Aunque eso al presidente le da igual: ""No estoy 100% seguro"" de tener que cumplir con la Constitución. ""Para eso tengo abogados"".

Y ante la avalancha de recursos, el presidente norteamericano acelera en su plan para tomar el control de los órganos judiciales. Hace unos días, nominó a Emil Bove como juez federal de apelaciones (corte que decidirá sobre los aranceles). Se trata de uno de sus abogados de cabecera y la persona que le defendió en varios de los casos criminales que sentaron a Trump en el banquillo de los acusados.

Más allá de la última decisión de la Corte de Comercio Internacional, los tribunales han paralizado durante las últimas semanas la mayor parte de la polémica agenda política, social y económica de Trump, decididos a poner fin al gran sueño del presidente de ""ser dictador por un día"", tal y como él mismo ha reconocido.

Deportaciones y política migratoria

La promesa electoral de articular la mayor deportación de inmigrantes es una de las que más conflicto está generando en los tribunales. Las órdenes presidenciales que Trump ha ido firmando desde enero fueron las primeras en ser impugnadas ante la Justicia y, por tanto, también representan las primeras derrotas en los juzgados de la Casa Blanca.

Entre los fallos más relevantes, figura el bloqueo de la orden que pretendía eliminar la ciudadanía por nacimiento para hijos de inmigrantes indocumentados y visitantes temporales. Cuatro jueces federales han emitido ya órdenes de restricción preliminares, bloqueando su aplicación por considerarla inconstitucional.

Otra orden exigía prueba de ciudadanía para registrarse para votar, pero también ha sido suspendida por un juez federal, que determinó que el presidente no puede modificar unilateralmente los requisitos electorales establecidos por el Congreso y los respectivos estados donde se celebren comicios.

Los tribunales han revocado y paralizado procesos de deportación, aunque en esta ocasión, incluso con sentencia en firme, es más difícil lograr que se cumplan, sobre todo cuando las deportaciones ya se han materializado.

Trump también puso fin a un programa iniciado por su antecesor, Joe Biden, para conceder permiso de trabajo y de residencia de forma temporal a personas en calidad de refugiados procedentes de lugares con conflictos armados, como Afganistán o Ucrania, así como de algunas regiones de Latinoamérica. Hace una semana, un juez federal decretó que la medida es ilegal porque no cuenta con el visto bueno del Congreso, pero el Supremo revocó el fallo el pasado viernes a la espera de un pronunciamiento en firme.

Agenda 'antiwoke'

Uno de los primeros documentos que firmó Trump nada más jurar el cargo como 47 presidente de EEUU fue la orden ejecutiva titulada Acabar con la discriminación ilegal y restablecer las oportunidades basadas en el mérito, que ponía fin a todas las políticas relacionadas con la diversidad, la equidad o la inclusión en ámbitos como la educación o el mundo corporativo. Obligaba también a las agencias federales a revisar y rescindir todos los contratos con empresas e instituciones que aplicaran algún tipo de programa o política en este sentido.

La orden ejecutiva ha sido impugnada en varios puntos de su redacción y en tribunales diferentes por todo el país. Desde mayo, su aplicación está parcialmente suspendida debido a varios fallos judiciales a favor de los demandantes, que aseguran que infringe la primera enmienda de la Constitución de EEUU, que protege las libertades fundamentales. Otros aspectos siguen en vigor, sobre todo los relacionados con el Departamento de Trabajo (prohibición de aplicar políticas de discriminación positiva). La Casa Blanca ha recurrido y el caso podría llegar en breve al Supremo.

Política exterior y ayuda internacional

El Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental (DOGE, por su siglas en inglés), dirigido hasta la semana pasada por el multimillonario Elon Musk, puso en marcha una agresiva estrategia de recorte de gastos. En total, identificó cerca de 180.000 millones de dólares que el Gobierno podría recortar de presupuestos destinados a causas consideradas por el hombre más rico del mundo como ""abusivas o prescindibles"".

Entre los muchos recortes implementados, se desmanteló Usaid, la agencia federal que se encarga de los programas estadounidenses de ayuda al exterior. Trump, siguiendo el consejo de Musk, puso fin a toda la financiación federal relacionada con estos proyectos. Sin embargo, un juez federal bloqueó la decisión y ha ordenado a la Administración restablecer los fondos previamente aprobados por el Congreso, argumentando que la suspensión carecía de justificación legal y perjudicaba la política exterior de EEUU.

Universidades privadas

La Universidad de Harvard también ha ganado el primer asalto judicial contra la Administración Trump y podrá seguir aceptando estudiantes internacionales hasta que se resuelva el conflicto de forma definitiva en los tribunales.

De momento, una jueza federal ha bloqueado el veto de la Casa Blanca a los estudiantes internacionales de Harvard, que no está dispuesta a claudicar y ha decidido llevar hasta las últimas consecuencias su enfrentamiento con el presidente de EEUU, Donald Trump. La universidad presentó hace unos días una demanda federal contra la Administración Trump para impugnar la decisión del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), que previamente había revocado su certificación para admitir estudiantes internacionales. De momento, el juez ha fallado a favor de la universidad y advierte de que bloqueará intentos futuros, a la espera de que se analice el caso.

También está pendiente el recurso contra la congelación de fondos federales a la universidad por no haber cedido a las demandas de Trump de cambiar alguna de sus políticas internas, en lo que la institución considera una intromisión a su independencia académica. Washington exige cambios en los contenidos que imparte y controles en la contratación de docentes y en los procesos de aceptación de estudiantes no alineados con las políticas más patrióticas de la Casa Blanca.

Ante la férrea defensa que presenta Harvard, Trump también ha anunciado que cancelará todos los contratos del Gobierno con la universidad, decisión que también acabará discutiéndose en los tribunales.

Represalias contra firmas legales

Trump emitió órdenes ejecutivas que sancionaban a bufetes como WilmerHale, Perkins Coie o Jenner & Block, acusándolos de actividades ""antipatrióticas"" por su participación en litigios contra su Administración o investigaciones contra él mismo en su anterior mandato. Los tribunales federales han anulado estas órdenes por considerarlas represalias inconstitucionales que violaban la Primera Enmienda y la separación de poderes. Los jueces han criticado duramente estas acciones, calificándolas de intentos autoritarios para silenciar la disidencia legal.

Educación y reestructuración gubernamental

Una orden ejecutiva que buscaba desmantelar el Departamento de Educación y despedir a más de 1.300 empleados públicos fue bloqueada por un juez federal a finales de mayo. El tribunal determinó que Trump no tiene autoridad para cerrar una agencia federal sin aprobación del Congreso y ordenó la reincorporación de los trabajadores despedidos.

Derechos LGBTQ+

El presidente norteamericano puso fin a la atención médica de afirmación de género para menores de 19 años a través de una orden ejecutiva que ha sido suspendida cautelarmente por dos jueces federales, bloqueando su aplicación hasta que se resuelva el litigio.

Además, Trump también firmó otra orden para prohibir el servicio militar a personas transgénero. Un juez federal bloqueó su implementación, aunque posteriormente el Tribunal Supremo ha dado el visto bueno temporal a su aplicación mientras se estudia el caso a fondo.

Financiación de medios de comunicación públicos

Trump también ha puesto punto y final a la financiación federal para la Radio Nacional Pública (NPR) y el Servicio Público de Radiotelevisión (PBS) de EEUU, ya que no le gusta las coberturas que hacen. El presidente norteamericano considera que ""ninguna de las dos entidades presenta un retrato justo, exacto o imparcial de la actualidad a los ciudadanos que pagan sus impuestos"".

Ambas corporaciones han impugnado judicialmente la decisión, alegando violaciones a la Primera Enmienda. El caso está en curso, y se espera que los tribunales determinen si la orden ejecutiva constituye una represalia política contra medios críticos al Gobierno.",2025-06-02 18:45:11+00:00,https://www.expansion.com/juridico/actualidad-tendencias/2025/06/02/683dd4dce5fdea365a8b4575.html,

A participação de quase três horas do cantor Bono, do U2, no podcast de Joe Rogan gerou críticas raivosas entre os ouvintes do apresentador. Ex-comediante de stand-up comedy e comentarista esportivo de UFC, Rogan apoio Donald Trump em 2024 e foi criticado por promover teorias da conspiração e fake news durante a pandemia de Covid-19. Rogan já recebeu Donald Trump e Elon Musk como convidados e tem entre os seus principais ouvintes apoiadores do atual presidente dos EUA.

Durante a entrevista, Bono criticou o desmantelamento da Agência dos Estados Unidos para o Desenvolvimento Internacional (USAID), citando nominalmente Elon Musk, que na época fazia parte do DOGE, o departamento de eficiência governamental do país. O cantor foi ao programa para promover seu documentário Bono: Stories of Surrender, disponível na AppleTV+.

Bono, que por anos fez campanha por ajuda humanitária no mundo, disse que, segundo um estudo da Universidade de Boston, os cortes poderão causar 300.000 mortes ao redor do mundo. “Há comida apodrecendo em barcos, em armazéns – 50 mil toneladas”, disse Bono. “As pessoas que conheciam os códigos, que eram responsáveis ​​por distribuir essa ajuda, foram demitidas. Isso não é a América, é?”, completou.

Os comentários de Bono causaram uma reação irada nos ouvintes do podcast e também em Elon Musk. Ele chamou Bono de “mentiroso e idiota” e afirmou que “zero pessoas morreram” como resultado do corte do USAID. Musk satirizou ainda Bono ao lembrar de um episódio da animação South Park. “South Park satirizou Bono como o maior babaca do mundo. Eles estavam certo”, escreveu Musk.

Por Max Blumenthal e Wyatt Reed*, no site da FEPAL

Altos legisladores israelenses acusaram seu próprio governo de lavar somas massivas de dinheiro por meio de uma rede obscura de organizações humanitárias e mercenárias nos EUA.

A iniciativa de ajuda instrumentalizada é o pilar central do plano de Israel para realizar uma limpeza étnica no norte de Gaza, forçando a população faminta a se concentrar em centros que lembram campos de concentração.

O esquema de Israel para comandar a distribuição de ajuda em Gaza terminou em caos no dia 27 de maio, quando soldados israelenses teriam aberto fogo contra multidões de palestinos famintos após apenas 8.000 caixas de rações terem sido distribuídas por uma organização obscura chamada Fundação Humanitária de Gaza (GHF, na sigla em inglês).

Fundada em fevereiro deste ano na Suíça sob um véu de mistério, a GHF funciona como um guarda-chuva para uma rede de empresas mercenárias privadas que Israel utiliza para substituir o papel das Nações Unidas na alimentação dos palestinos após levá-los à beira da fome.

Atualmente, o público não tem ideia de quem está financiando essa operação opaca. Um porta-voz da GHF disse ao Washington Post que “a fundação já garantiu US$ 100 milhões de um doador não revelado”.

O político da direita israelense e membro do Knesset Avigdor Lieberman proclamou que o anjo financeiro misterioso da GHF era, de fato, o próprio governo de Israel.

“O dinheiro para ajuda humanitária vem do Mossad e do Ministério da Defesa”, escreveu Lieberman no Twitter/X, reclamando: “Centenas de milhões de dólares às custas dos cidadãos israelenses.”

Apoie o VIOMUNDO R$ 5 R$ 15 R$ 35 Qualquer valor

Yair Lapid, membro do Knesset e líder de fato da oposição leal a Israel, acusou o governo de financiar duas “empresas de fachada”, apontando para a GHF e a empresa mercenária privada Safe Reach Solutions, fundada pelo ex-agente da CIA Phillip Reilly.

Dois ex-funcionários do governo dos EUA disseram ao Middle East Eye, propriedade do Catar, que Reilly “conquistou a confiança do primeiro-ministro israelense Benjamin Netanyahu e de vários empresários israelenses próximos a ele.”

Se verdadeiro, isso significaria que o aparato militar e de inteligência de Israel está, efetivamente, lavando enormes somas de dinheiro por meio de um esquema de ajuda instrumentalizada que forma o pilar do plano de limpeza étnica no norte de Gaza.

Um documento interno vazado da GHF reconheceu que os centros de distribuição de alimentos e complexos residenciais sendo construídos em Gaza poderiam ser percebidos como “’campos de concentração’ com biometria”.

O modelo da GHF parece ser parte integral do plano declarado de Israel de ocupar 75% da Faixa de Gaza, forçando palestinos famintos e sem teto para o que o exército israelense chama de “ilhas humanitárias”, projetadas para “dividir e dominar” o enclave devastado.

Trata-se também de uma tentativa clara de substituir a UNRWA, a agência das Nações Unidas que atende a população refugiada de Gaza desde 1949, e que o Knesset israelense designou como organização terrorista em 2024.

Plano israelense das “ilhas humanitárias” visa abertamente dividir e controlar Gaza impedindo o movimento da população

A criação da GHF pode ser diretamente traçada até o escritório COGAT do governo israelense, que supervisiona o cerco a Gaza, bem como a um empreendedor israelense chamado Liran Tancman, descrito em uma reportagem como “um reservista da unidade 8200 de inteligência de sinais das FDI, que defendeu o uso de sistemas biométricos de identificação fora dos centros de distribuição para avaliar civis palestinos”.

Sem status legal ou mandato formal para operar em Gaza, a GHF atua atualmente com o aval do exército de ocupação israelense. Com o endosso do governo Trump e com mercenários dos EUA operando seus centros de distribuição distópicos, o esquema funciona sob fachada americana.

Apenas um dia antes do lançamento da GHF em Gaza, seu CEO, Jake Wood, renunciou em protesto, condenando a falha da organização em manter os “princípios humanitários de humanidade, neutralidade e imparcialidade.”

Em seguida, o COO da GHF, David Burke, também abandonou o navio. David Kohler, membro suíço do conselho, também renunciou sem explicações.

Após suas saídas, a liderança da entidade obscura passou para John Acree, ex-administrador da USAID, que recentemente acusou o Presidente de dar um “passe livre” para a Rússia em uma postagem confusa no Facebook atacando o “criminoso” Trump por cortar fundos de seu antigo empregador.

Mesmo após o caos no posto de ajuda militarizada da GHF no oeste de Rafah em 27 de maio, uma rede de empresas mercenárias obscuras, incluindo Safe Reach Solutions e UG Solutions, continuou oferecendo cargos altamente remunerados para possíveis soldados de aluguel.

Uma vaga publicada pela UG Solutions buscava “snipers” com “experiência prévia em zonas de combate,” “proficiência máxima com armas” e “habilidades de combate avançadas” capazes de “operar de forma eficaz em ambientes de alta ameaça.” Haveria preferência para “pessoal qualificado em Forças Especiais,” assim como “pessoal com histórico em OSINT/Inteligência.”

O fundador da UG Solutions, Jameson Govoni, se descreve como um “degenerado de Boston” que “entrou no Exército o mais rápido possível para infligir dor àqueles que nos causaram dor.”

Ele também fundou uma empresa chamada Alcohol Armor, que comercializa soluções de recuperação para ressaca supostamente baseadas em sua experiência em ficar bêbado. “No exército, somos de longe os piores bebedores do mundo. Já tive meu estômago bombeado”, gabou-se seu sócio Glenn Devitt.

Phillip Reilly, o ex-agente da CIA normalmente ávido por publicidade e fundador da Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) – parceira da GHF e da UG Solutions – até hoje não falou publicamente sobre suas aparentemente lucrativas atividades em Gaza.

A SRS apareceu pela primeira vez em Gaza em janeiro, quando um grupo de mercenários de meia-idade retratados pela mídia dos EUA como “pais de subúrbio” montaram um posto de controle no Corredor Netzarim, uma área que divide as regiões norte e central de Gaza e que o exército israelense tem usado como base para abusar e massacrar civis.

Um documento da SRS distribuído a possíveis apoiadores (ver abaixo) pedia “parceiros humanitários” para ajudar a transformar o posto de controle em “um ponto de distribuição de ajuda.” Dias depois, a GHF foi fundada em Genebra, Suíça.

Um documento da GHF divulgado à imprensa no início de maio listava uma série de grandes empresas e ex-funcionários do governo dos EUA como membros do conselho, e alardeava parcerias com instituições financeiras como o Goldman Sachs.

O conselho incluía Raisa Sheynberg, ex-funcionária do Departamento do Tesouro que integrou a equipe de políticas públicas do projeto de criptomoeda Libra do Meta, e David Beasley, ex-governador da Carolina do Sul e ex-diretor do Programa Mundial de Alimentos.

O comunicado de imprensa prometia que os líderes da GHF colocariam “a humanidade em primeiro lugar” ao “perseguir abordagens pragmáticas para problemas intratáveis.”

A conexão oculta com o chef Jose Andres

No dia do lançamento desastroso da GHF no sul de Gaza, o chef-celebridade espanhol, fundador da World Central Kitchen e ex-“embaixador culinário” do Departamento de Estado, Jose Andres, criticou a iniciativa, escrevendo no X: “A Gaza Humanitarian Foundation deixou os palestinos sem comida. As pessoas que a criaram são egoístas.”

O principal entre esses “egoístas” seria o ex-CEO da World Central Kitchen, Nate Mook. Como mostrou o jornalista israelense Uri Blau, documentos de incorporação apresentados às autoridades suíças listam Mook como fundador da GHF.

Ele também foi nomeado como membro do conselho no material que a GHF distribuiu à imprensa sobre seu lançamento. Desde a renúncia da liderança da GHF, no entanto, Mook nega qualquer envolvimento formal com a organização, evitando contato com jornalistas.

Andres deve grande parte de sua imagem como herói humanitário global ao veículo de relações públicas de 2022 disfarçado de documentário intitulado humildemente “We Feed People”. O filme foi dirigido pelo figurão de Hollywood Ron Howard e produzido por Mook, que então era CEO da WCK.

De acordo com sua biografia no Instituto McCain (financiado pela indústria de armamentos), onde atua como “Conselheiro Especial para a Ucrânia,” Mook afirma ter trabalhado com Andres desde 2012, “construindo a WCK de um funcionário e menos de US$ 1 milhão por ano para US$ 400 milhões de impacto global em 2022.”

Apesar de sua condenação à GHF, Andres teve um papel inicial e importante no projeto de subverter o sistema de ajuda humanitária em Gaza, afastando-o da ONU e alinhando-o com os objetivos israelenses.

Como relatado pelo The Grayzone, Andres supervisionou o esforço da WCK em 2024 para construir um píer feito de escombros de casas em Gaza, que permitiria o desembarque de ajuda em cozinhas operadas por sua ONG em coordenação com o exército israelense.

Quando a então Ministra dos Direitos Sociais da Espanha, Ione Belarra, acusou Israel de genocídio em Gaza, Andres saiu em defesa do Estado de apartheid, afirmando no Twitter/X que Israel estava apenas “defendendo seus cidadãos,” declarando que Belarra “não merecia ser ministra,” e acusando-a de simpatia com o Hamas.

Enquanto isso, Andres continuou próximo ao Secretário de Estado dos EUA, Antony Blinken, que o nomeou “embaixador culinário” do Departamento de Estado em fevereiro de 2023.

Em setembro de 2024, quase um ano após o cerco genocida israelense a Gaza, Andres foi visto festejando em uma recepção no Metropolitan Museum of Art ao lado de Blinken, do então porta-voz do Conselho de Segurança Nacional John Kirby e do prefeito de Nova York, Eric Adams.

Menos de seis meses haviam se passado desde que o exército israelense, com armamento americano, assassinou sete funcionários da WCK em um ataque duplo direcionado a seu comboio humanitário em 1º de abril de 2024.

Mesmo assim, Andres ainda busca colaboração com autoridades da ocupação israelense, agradecendo aos administradores do cerco do COGAT em 28 de maio passado.

GHF expulsa da Suíça, foge para os EUA

No dia 29 de maio, autoridades suíças anunciaram que a GHF estava violando várias leis que regem fundações registradas no país.

A organização obscura anunciou então que está transferindo suas operações para os EUA, onde provavelmente enfrentará menos escrutínio de uma administração Trump que endossou sua criação.

Embora seu lançamento caótico em Gaza tenha gerado manchetes internacionais, a GHF permanece envolta em mistério, com mercenários mascarados operando suas atividades no local e uma rede de advogados corporativos atuando por trás de empresas de fachada que receberam milhões de dólares de origem desconhecida.

Talvez a única coisa certa sobre essa entidade opaca é que sua presença trará ainda mais sofrimento à população de Gaza sob o disfarce da caridade.

Lytt til saken

FBI sier han hadde planlagt angrepet i ett år.

Egyptiske Mohamed Sabry Soliman (45) hadde med seg minst 14 ubrukte molotovcocktails da han ble pågrepet etter angrepet i Boulder, Colorado søndag. Blant de skadede var en 88 år gammel Holocaust-overlevende.

FBI har nå siktet Soliman for hatkriminalitet.

– Han fortalte politiet at sionister var målet hans, og at han ville gjennomført angrepet igjen, skriver FBI i rettsdokumenter.

FBI-agent Jessica Krueger skriver i en begjæring om varetektsfengsling at Soliman hadde planlagt søndagens angrep i ett år. Han hadde ventet til etter at datteren hans var ferdig på skolen.

Ifølge FBI ankom Soliman åstedet klokken 12:55 lokal tid og ventet på gruppen «Run for Their Lives».

Etter at han ble arrestert, fortalte Soliman politiet at sionister var målet hans og at han ville gjennomført angrepet igjen, skriver FBI. I dokumentet definerer FBI «sionist» som «personer som tror på opprettelsen av en jødisk stat og støtter Israels regjering».

Overskred visum

Soliman kom til USA på turistvisum i august 2022, som utløp i februar 2023, opplyser amerikanske myndigheter til BBC. Han søkte om asyl i september 2022.

Ifølge CBS News har Soliman siden begynnelsen av 2024 jobbet for et selskap kalt Veros Health i Centennial, Colorado – omtrent 45 minutters kjøring fra Boulder. Han jobbet der i mindre enn seks måneder, ifølge nyhetskanalen.

Det hvite hus hevder Soliman oppholdt seg ulovlig i landet etter at visumet hans utløp.

Politisk strid

Angrepet har raskt blitt trukket inn i amerikansk politikk, skriver BBCs Nord-Amerika-korrespondent Anthony Zurcher.

USAs president Donald Trump har lovet at gjerningsmannen vil bli «straffeforfulgt til lovens fulle utstrekning». Han legger skylden på sin forgjenger, Joe Biden, for at Soliman befant seg i landet.

– Mitt hjerte går ut til ofrene for denne forferdelige tragedien og det flotte folket i Boulder, Colorado, skrev Trump.

Foto: Leah Millis / Reuters / NTB

Stephen Miller, som er visestabssjef i Det hvite hus og en av administrasjonens sterkeste talspersoner for streng innvandringskontroll, skrev en melding på X at Soliman fikk arbeidstillatelse av Biden-administrasjonen etter at han hadde overskredet turistvisumet sitt.

– Selvmordsinnvandring må reverseres fullstendig, konkluderte han.

Colorados guvernør Jared Polis fordømte angrepet og sa at hans tanker er med de skadede.

– Når det jødiske samfunnet fortsatt er i sjokk etter de nylige antisemittiske drapene i Washington DC, er det ubegripelig at samfunnet står overfor nok et antisemittisk angrep her i Boulder på kvelden før Shavuot-høytiden, skrev han.

Ropte «Fri Palestina»

Angrepet skjedde søndag ettermiddag lokal tid i en park i Boulder, der en gruppe mennesker var samlet for å delta i et ukentlig arrangement til støtte for israelske gisler som holdes fanget av Hamas i Gaza.

Ifølge politiet kastet Soliman to brennende molotovcocktails mot folkemengden mens han ropte «Fri Palestina!».

Åtte personer i alderen 52 til 88 år ble skadet og sendt til sykehus. Minst én av dem er i kritisk tilstand.

Politiet fant også en ryggsekksprøyte med bensin, og i bilen hans lå det rødt materiale som lignet på fillene som stakk ut av de ubrukte brannbombene, en rød bensinkanne og papirer med ordene «Israel», «Palestina» og «USAID», ifølge rettsdokumenter.",2025-06-02 18:22:24+00:00,https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/Xj0WX7/fbi-mohamed-sabry-soliman-siktet-for-hatkriminalitet,

Así lo constatan los documentos judiciales presentados este lunes y a los que ha tenido acceso Associated Press.

El sospechoso, Mohammed Sabry Soliman, de 45 años, declaró a la policía que llevaba un año planeando el ataque y que eligió como objetivo lo que describió como el “grupo sionista”, según la declaración del FBI. En el ataque, ocho personas resultaron heridas, algunas con quemaduras, cuando el grupo terminaba su manifestación semanal para pedir visibilidad sobre los rehenes que siguen en Gaza. Algunos testigos afirmaron que el hombre gritó “¡Libertad para Palestina!” durante el ataque.

En una declaración jurada, el FBI asegura que Soliman confesó el ataque tras ser detenido el domingo y dijo a los agentes que lo volvería a hacer.

“El atroz ataque de ayer en Boulder, Colorado, NO SERÁ TOLERADO en Estados Unidos”, ha dicho el presidente de EEUU, Donald Trump, que ha culpado a Joe Biden de que el detenido estuviera en suelo estadounidense: “Entró gracias a la ridícula política de fronteras abiertas de Biden, que ha dañado tanto a nuestro país. Debe ser deportado bajo la política de TRUMP. Los actos de terrorismo serán procesados con todo el peso de la ley. Este es otro ejemplo de por qué debemos mantener nuestras fronteras SEGURAS y deportar a los radicales ilegales y antiamericanos de nuestra patria. Mi corazón está con las víctimas de esta terrible tragedia y con el gran pueblo de Boulder, Colorado”.

Está previsto que comparezca ante un tribunal estatal en Boulder este lunes. Soliman, natural de Egipto, podría enfrentarse a una pena de hasta diez años de prisión, aunque no se descarta que se presenten cargos adicionales.

La policía encontró más de una docena de cócteles molotov sin detonar cerca del lugar donde fue arrestado Soliman. Según el FBI, los artefactos estaban compuestos por botellas de cristal —como jarras de vino— llenas de un líquido transparente y con trapos rojos sobresaliendo. En el coche del sospechoso, los agentes hallaron papeles con las palabras “Israel”, “Palestina” y “USAID”, según consta en la declaración jurada.

Soliman declaró a los investigadores que fabricó los cócteles molotov tras ver vídeos en YouTube y comprar los ingredientes por su cuenta. “Afirmó que llevaba un año planeando el ataque y que esperaba a que su hija se graduara para llevarlo a cabo”, señala el documento del FBI.

El grupo atacado ha explicado que se manifestaba para visibilizar la situación de los rehenes israelíes retenidos en Gaza.

Según informó en la red social X la subsecretaria adjunta del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, Soliman residía en Estados Unidos de forma irregular desde que su visado de turista (B2), con el que ingresó en agosto de 2022, expirara en febrero de 2023.

The charging documents recommended charging Saliman for violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 249(a)(1) and (a)(2) known as the Hate Crime Acts:

(a)(1) Offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin.—Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any person—

(a)(2) Offenses involving actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.—

Each charge recommends a maximum of 10 years in prison.

Soliman is an illegal alien from Egypt. He entered America under former President Joe Biden’s administration and received a “B1/B2 nonimmigrant visa with an authorized stay through 2/26/23.”

Then Soliman filed an asylum claim in 2022. Biden’s administration provided him with work authorization.

The authorization expired at the end of March.

FBI Agent Jessica Krueger wrote that she believes there is probable cause to believe that Soliman violated those laws “by throwing Molotov cocktails into a pro-Israel crowd while yelling ‘Free Palestine’ and injuring eight individuals.”

Police arrested Soliman at the scene:

SOLIMAN was placed under arrest and a mirandized interview was conducted by local and federal law enforcement. During the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them. He traveled to Boulder, Colorado in his vehicle with the Molotov cocktails and threw two of the cocktails at individuals participating in a pro-Israel gathering. He also stated that he picked up gas at a gas station on the way to Boulder. He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead. SOLIMAN stated he would do it (conduct an attack) again. He specifically targeted the “Zionist Group” that had gathered in Boulder having learned about the group from an online search. SOLIMAN knew that they planned to meet today, Sunday, June 1 at 1pm. He arrived at approximately 12:55 p.m. and waited for them. Throughout the interview, SOLIMAN stated that he hated the Zionist group and did this because he hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over “our land,” which he explained to be Palestine. He stated that he had been planning the attack for a year and was waiting until after his daughter graduated to conduct the attack.

Krueger also described the video posted on social media with a man identified as a shirtless Soliman “holding what appear to be Molotov cocktails, glass bottles containing clear liquid with a red rag hanging from the top of the bottle.”

The FBI discovered “at least fourteen unlit Molotov cocktails, comprised of glass wine carafe bottles or Ball jars containing clear liquid and red rags hanging out of the bottles” in a black plastic container.

The agents also found “a backpack weed sprayer, potentially containing a flammable substance.”

“The clear liquid in the glass bottles and weed sprayer were determined to be 87 octane gasoline, which was determined to contain xylene based on a field test,” according to Krueger.

A car registered to Soliman had “red material consistent with the rags found in the black plastic container; a red gas container; and paperwork with the words, ‘Israel,’ ‘Palestine,’ and ‘USAID.'”

Salimon faces these state charges:

Murder in the first degree – deliberation with intent

Murder in the first degree – extreme indifference

Crimes against at-risk adults/elderly

1st degree assault – non-family

1st degree assault – heat of passion

Criminal attempt to commit class one and class two felonies

Use of explosives or incendiary devices during felony.

As far as I know, no one has died yet. I’m guessing the murder charge is there for procedural reasons in Colorado.

The attack injured four men and four women, aged 52 to 88. At least one is in critical condition.

Cambiar eso implica mucho más que tachar un ingrediente del plato. Por eso, para muchas personas, dar el salto hacia una alimentación sin carne requiere un punto medio. Un puente. Ese camino lo está recorriendo la infanta Cristina, siguiendo el ejemplo de su madre, la reina emérita Sofía, reduciendo su consumo de carne, pero sin eliminar el pescado. Esa elección, cada vez más común, se conoce como pescetarismo.

Sin carne, pero con pescado. Esta dieta se basa principalmente en alimentos vegetales, pescados y mariscos, pero excluye la carne roja y de ave. Por su parte, algunas personas también optan por incorporar huevos y lácteos, como es el caso de la infanta tal como ha explicado la revista Semana.

Detrás de esta dieta. Este tipo de alimentación combina los antioxidantes propios de una alimentación basada en vegetales con las proteínas completas y ácidos grasos omega-3 del pescado, según Women's Health Mag. Además, la vitamina B12, un nutriente difícil de encontrar en una dieta vegetal estricta, que la pueden cubrir con una solo una ración de pescado.

En un reportaje de Harvard Health, el Dr. Frank Hu ha subrayado que el pescado también aporta vitamina D, hierro, selenio y zinc, todos esenciales para el buen funcionamiento del organismo. A esto se suma la creciente evidencia de que este patrón alimentario está relacionado con un menor riesgo de enfermedades crónicas, como la diabetes tipo 2, la demencia, la depresión o las patologías cardíacas.

No todo es perfecto. Uno de los principales riesgos de empezar con una dieta pescetariana es el consumo excesivo de mercurio, un contaminante presente en pescados grandes y longevos. Por ello, desde Women's Health Mag han recomendado comer pescados y mariscos tipo salmón, sardinas, bacalao y almejas.

¿Pero no hay otra opción? Sí, existe otra modalidad que se llama flexitarismo. Ambas comparten un mismo objetivo de reducir el consumo de carne y apostar por una alimentación más vegetal. Sin embargo, aquí entra la gran diferencia y como se ha observado el pescetarismo es más definido: excluye por completo la carne roja y las aves. En cambio, el flexitarismo es más flexible, ya que no elimina ningún grupo de alimentos, pero limita el consumo de carne de forma voluntaria, según MayoClinic. Es una opción ideal para quienes buscan mejorar su dieta sin imponer restricciones estrictas, y prefieren adaptarla según el contexto o sus hábitos personales.

Una tendencia en crecimiento. Cada vez más figuras públicas adoptan este tipo de alimentación. Desde Harry Styles hasta Victoria Beckham y Danna Paola, la lista de pescetarianos va en aumento. Las razones van desde la salud hasta la sostenibilidad, pasando por la ética y el bienestar animal, tal y como ha recogido la revista Semana.

Lo que comenzó como una elección puntual entre celebridades empieza a reflejarse también en los hábitos de consumo de una parte de la población. El pescetarismo se consolida como una opción intermedia dentro del espectro de dietas que reducen o eliminan la carne, en un contexto de creciente interés por modelos alimentarios más sostenibles y basados en plantas.

The suspect prepared for what he thought could turn into a suicide mission by spending months researching details, including on YouTube to learn how to make Molotov cocktails, officials said.

He ended up using Ball jars and gasoline to fashion them, choosing red rags for fuses, authorities said.

He told authorities after his arrest that he “hated” the group and needed to stop it from taking over “our land,” which he explained meant Palestinian territory, according to court documents.

Soliman found out exactly where and when the participants gathered every Sunday and finally chose this past Sunday afternoon to launch his assault, the feds said.

Before leaving his family’s home in Colorado Springs about an hour and a half from Boulder, Soliman left messages to his wife and children hidden in a desk drawer, authorities said

He “planned on dying,” officials said.

He then took off in his 2015 silver Toyota Prius, buying gas along the way for his incendiary weapons, court documents said.

Soliman, who was in the US illegally after overstaying his visa by more than two years, dressed up as a grounds worker and held a lighter in front of a garden hose filled with 87 octane gasoline, shouting “free Palestine!” as he attempted to set his victims on fire, the complaint said.

He then lobbed a pair of Molotov cocktails, with cops finding 14 more in a plastic container near where he was arrested, officials said.

The suspect allegedly told cops he wanted to kill Jews.

Documents recovered from his Prius allegedly included the words “Israel,” “Palestine” and “USAID.”

Soliman was hit with federal hate-crime charges along with raps involving attempted murder in the attack, which injured 12 people, including one critically.

During his interview with law enforcement, Soliman stated that he wanted to “kill all Zionist people” and that he “wished they were all dead,” the document revealed.

He also said he would launch the attack again if given the opportunity.

Video taken as the attack unfolded showed a bare-chested Soliman brandishing the incendiary devices.

He ended up removing his shirt when it caught fire as he wielded his homemade flamethrower.

The victims were all transported to local hospitals, with one in critical condition. Soliman was also injured and brought to a hospital for treatment after he was taken into custody.

A mugshot later released by the Boulder Police Department shows the deranged man wearing a large bandage over his right ear and appearing to have scorch marks on his face.

The White House called the sickening act of violence “an antisemitic terror attack,” and the FBI said it’s treating the attack as a “targeted act of terrorism.”

6 Mohamed Sabry Soliman was in the US illegally.

Boulder’s woke Police Chief Stephen Redfearn — who promised to emphasize “equitable” policing when he became chief last year — stopped short of calling the incident terrorism Sunday, urging, “Now is not the time to be divisive” in a press conference.

Soliman first entered the US through Los Angeles International Airport on a B2 visa on Aug. 27, 2022, sources told The Post and Fox News.

Such visas are given to people who are supposed to be temporarily visiting the country for such things as tourism and to visit family and friends. Soliman’s visitor’s visa expired in February 2023, sources told The Post.

Meanwhile, he applied for asylum in September 2022, sources said. He also applied for a work visa.

His asylum request was still pending at the time of the attack. His work visa had been granted but expired this past March.

DAVID BROOKS, NEW YORK TIMES: Yes, I'm not sure it was wreckage. There was wreckage if you're at NIH. There are wreckage at certain agencies, but the guy only saved $65 billion out of a multitrillion-dollar budget.

So, as a budget matter, you would not say he had a big effect, but he did manage to destroy NIH and USAID. And the USAID one is the one I haven't gotten over. And so there's folks at Boston University who count, how many people have died because of what DOGE did at USAID? And USAID was a very ill-managed organization. That's true.

But according to the Boston University folks, so far, 55,000 adults have died of AIDS in the four months since Trump was elected, 6,000 children are dead because of what DOGE did. That's just PEPFAR, the HIV. You add them all up, that's 300,000 dead, and we're four months in.

Now, you add, accumulate that over four years, the number of dead grows very high. There are mass murderers in the world, Pol Pot, Mao Tse-Tung, Stalin. We don't have anybody on the list from America. And I don't think it's the same as committing the kind of genocide they did. But by taking away that agency and being at least semi-responsible for the deaths of probably by the end of this hundreds of thousands of millions of people, that's Elon Musk's legacy.

O presidente da American Bar Association, William R. Bay, manifestou-se nas redes sociais da instituição sobre os ataques recentes de Donald Trump contra a associação. A ABA, que funciona como a ordem dos advogados dos Estados Unidos, está sendo atacada por Trump sob as falsas acusações de apoiar causas progressistas e de ter movido uma ação contra o Executivo.

As acusações, que fazem parte de um contexto maior de ataques de Trump à advocacia, estão em um memorando feito pelo vice-procurador-geral do Departamento de Justiça (DOJ), Todd Blanche, distribuído a todos os procuradores federais do país. O documento propõe o rompimento de relações do DOJ com a ABA.

Em seu comunicado, Bay fez um apelo para que os advogados e profissionais do sistema judiciário se posicionem a favor da entidade. “Juntos, somos mais fortes. A luta para preservar a nossa democracia é muito importante para permanecermos em silêncio.”

As acusações do DOJ se referem a um pedido que a ABA protocolou para ingressar como amicus curiae em uma ação que tem como partes instituições ligadas à U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Essas instituições questionaram na Justiça Federal o congelamento de fundos para assistência a outros países. A agência presta serviços, por exemplo, de ajuda humanitária a nações que estão em situação vulnerável.

Bay também já havia criticado algumas ações do governo Trump, como ameaçar juízes de impeachment, atacar escritórios de advocacia que contratam profissionais odiados pelo presidente ou que representam clientes que são adversários do governo, além da perseguição a procuradores federais.

“Tais ações interferem na atuação justa e imparcial das cortes, violam os direitos constitucionais do cidadão a um advogado, ao devido processo e à liberdade de expressão”, disse Bay na ocasião.

A ABA também declarou que se opõe às ordens executivas de Trump que demandam investigações de programas de diversidade e inclusão, principalmente os adotados por suas seccionais. Para a associação, as investigações violam a Primeira Emenda da Constituição, que garante a liberdade de expressão e de associação.",2025-06-02 14:57:08+00:00,https://www.conjur.com.br/2025-jun-02/american-bar-association-pede-apoio-de-advogados-contra-ataques-de-trump/,

With Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax plan, the deficit will increase by $4-5 trillion, so Musk’s chainsaw contributed nothing but demoralization and destruction of the federal workforce. She also summarizes the multiple ways in which Trump is sabotaging the rule of law. She includes footnotes, as usual. Subscribe to her blog to see them.

She writes:

In July 2024, according to an article published today by Kirsten Grind and Megan Twohey in the New York Times, billionaire Elon Musk texted privately about his concerns that government investigations into his businesses would “take me down.” “I can’t be president,” he wrote, “but I can help Trump defeat Biden and I will.”

After appearing on stage with Trump on October 5, Musk texted a person close to him: “I’m feeling more optimistic after tonight. Tomorrow we unleash the anomaly in the matrix.” About an hour later, he added: “This is not something on the chessboard, so they will be quite surprised. “‘Lasers’ from space.”

Musk invested about $290 million in the 2024 election and, when Trump took office, became a fixture in the White House, heading the “Department of Government Efficiency.” It set out to kill government programs by withholding congressionally approved funds, a practice that courts have ruled unconstitutional and Congress expressly prohibited with the 1974 Impoundment Control Act.

Musk vowed that his “Department of Government Efficiency” would cut $2 trillion from the U.S. budget, but he quickly backed off on those numbers. In the end, DOGE claimed savings of $175 billion, but that claim is unverifiable and CNN’s Casey Tolan says it’s probably wrong: less than half of it is backed up with any documentation.

Instead, as CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf reported today, since DOGE cut staffing at the enforcement wing of the Internal Revenue Service, for example, and cut employees at national parks, which also generate revenue, its cuts may well end up costing money. Max Stier, who heads the Partnership for Public Service, suggests DOGE cuts could cost U.S. taxpayers $135 billion because agencies will need to train and hire replacements for the workers DOGE fired. Stier called DOGE’s actions “arson of a public asset.”

Grind and Twohey reported that Musk’s drug consumption during the campaign—they could not speak to his habits in the White House, although he appeared high today at a White House press conference—was “more intense than previously known.” He was a chronic user of ketamine, took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, and traveled with a box that held about 20 pills for daily use. Those in frequent contact with him worried about his frequent drug use, erratic behavior, and mood swings. As a government contractor, Musk should receive random drug tests, but Grind and Twohey say he received advance warning of those tests.

It was never clear that Musk’s role at DOGE was legal, and the White House has tried to maintain that he was only an advisor, despite Trump’s February 19 statement, “I signed an order creating [DOGE] and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.” On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that 14 states can proceed with their lawsuit against billionaire Elon Musk and the “Department of Government Efficiency,” saying the states had adequately supported their argument that “Musk and DOGE’s conduct is ‘unauthorized by any law.’”

Trump posted today on social media: “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way. Elon is terrific!” In a press conference today, Trump reiterated that Musk “is not really leaving.”

Musk’s time at the helm of DOGE might not have saved taxpayer money, but it has changed the world in other ways. Musk has used his time in the government to end investigations into his companies, score government contracts, and get the government to press countries to accept his Starlink communications network as a condition of tariff negotiations. According to John Hyatt of Forbes, Musk’s association with Trump has made him an estimated $170 billion richer.

The implications of DOGE’s actions for Americans are huge. DOGE operatives are now embedded in the U.S. government, where they are mining Americans’ data to create a master database that can sort and find individuals. Former Ohio Democratic Party chair David Pepper called it “a full-scale redirection of the government’s digital nervous system into the hands of an unelected billionaire.”

Today, Sheera Frenkel and Aaron Krolik of the New York Times reported that Musk put billionaire Peter Thiel’s Palantir data analysis firm into place across the government, where it launched its product Foundry to organize, analyze, and merge data. Thiel provided the money behind Vice President J.D. Vance’s political career. Wired and CNN had previously reported how the administration was using this merged data to target undocumented immigrants, and now employees are detailing their concerns with how the administration could use their newly merged information against Americans more generally.

Internationally, Musk’s destruction of the United States Agency for International Development, slashing about 80% of its grants, is killing about 103 people an hour, most of them children. The total so far is about 300,000 people, according to Boston University infectious disease mathematical modeller Dr. Brooke Nichols. Ryan Cooper of The American Prospect reported today that about 1,500 babies a day are born HIV-positive because Musk’s cuts stopped their mothers’ medication.

In the New York Times today, Michelle Goldberg recalls how Musk appeared uninterested in learning what USAID actually did—prevent starvation and provide basic healthcare—and instead called it a “radical-left political psy-op,” and reposted a smear from right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos calling USAID “the most gigantic global terror organization in history.” Goldberg also recalls Musk’s tendency to call people he disdains “NPCs,” or non-player characters, which are characters in role-playing games whose only role is to advance the storyline for the real players.

Aside from DOGE, the focus of Trump’s administration—other than his own cashing in on the presidency—has been on tariffs and immigration. Like the efforts of DOGE, those show a disdain for the law in favor of concentrating power in the executive branch.

During the campaign, Trump fantasized that constructing a high tariff wall around the U.S. would force other countries to fund the national deficit, enabling a Republican Congress to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. In fact, domestic industries and consumers bear the costs of tariffs. Trump’s high tariffs, many of which he imposed by declaring an economic emergency and then using the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), created such havoc in the stock and bond markets that he backed off.

Yesterday, Sayantani Ghosh, David Gaffen, and Arpan Varghese of Reuters reported that although most of the highest tariffs have yet to go into effect, Trump’s trade war has cost companies more than $34 billion in lost sales and higher costs.

Trump has changed tariff policies at least 50 times since he took office, and traders have figured out they can buy stocks cheaply when markets plummet after a dramatic tariff announcement, and sell when Trump changes his mind. This has recently given rise to Trump’s nickname “TACO,” for “Trump Always Chickens Out.”

This moniker has apparently irritated Trump so much he has taken to social media to defend his abrupt dropping of tariffs on China, saying he did it to “save them” from “grave economic danger,” although in fact, China turned to other trading partners to cushion the blow of U.S. tariffs. Trump went on to suggest China did not live up to what he considered its part of the bargain, and he would no longer be “Mr. NICE GUY!”

On Wednesday a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Donald J. Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs based on the IEEPA are illegal. The Constitution gives to Congress, not to the president, the power to levy tariffs. Trump launched a social media rant in which he attacked the judges, insisted that “it is only because of my successful use of Tariffs that many Trillions of Dollars have already begun pouring into the U.S.A. from other Countries,” and said that he could not wait for Congress to handle tariffs because it would take too long—in fact, most of Congress does not approve of the tariffs—and that following the Constitution “would completely destroy Presidential Power.” “The President of the United States must be allowed to protect America against those that are doing it Economic and Financial harm.”

Yesterday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused that ruling until at least June 9, when both parties will have submitted legal arguments about whether the stay should remain in place as the government appeals the ruling that the tariffs are illegal. White House senior counsel for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro, the key proponent of Trump’s trade war, said: “Even if we lose, we’ll do it another way.”

Today Trump said he will double the tariff on steel imports from 25% to 50%.

The other major focus of the administration has been expelling undocumented immigrants from the U.S. During the 2024 campaign, Trump whipped up support by insisting that former President Joe Biden had permitted criminals to walk into the U.S. and terrorize American citizens. Trump vowed to launch the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and often talked of deporting the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., although his numbers have ranged as high as 21 million without explanation.

The administration has hammered on immigration to promote the idea that it is keeping Americans safe. But its first target of arresting at least 1,200 individuals a day has fallen far short. In Trump’s first 100 days, Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it arrested an average of about 660 people a day.

On Wednesday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who along with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is the face of the administration’s immigration policy, told the Fox News Channel that the administration is now aiming for “a minimum of 3,000 arrests…every day.” Administration officials hope to deport a million people in Trump’s first year in office.

CNN reported yesterday that those officials are putting intense pressure on law enforcement agencies to meet that goal. This means that hundreds of FBI agents have been taken off terror threats and espionage cases involving China and Russia to be reassigned to immigration duties. Some FBI offices are offering overtime pay if agents help with “enforcement and removal operations.” Officers from other agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have also been deployed against immigrants in place of their regular duties.

Steven Monacelli of The Barbed Wire noted today that local law enforcement and state troopers have also been diverted to immigration, using a national network of cameras that read license plates. Joseph Cox and Jason Keobler of 404 Media reported yesterday that a Texas sheriff used the same system over the course of a month to look for a woman whom he said had a self-administered abortion, saying her family was worried about her safety.

Their attempt to appear effective has led to very visible arrests and renditions of undocumented migrants to prisons in third countries, especially the notorious CECOT terrorist prison in El Salvador. The administration has deliberately flouted the right of persons in the United States to due process as guaranteed by the Constitution. The administration has met court orders with delay and obfuscation, as well as by attacking judges and the rule of law.

The administration continues to insist those it has arrested are dangerous criminals who must be deported without delay, but more and more reporting says that many of those expelled from the country had no criminal convictions. Today, ProPublica reported that the Trump administration’s own data shows that officials knew that “the vast majority” of the 238 Venezuelans it sent to CECOT had not been convicted of crimes in the U.S. even as it deported them and called them “rapists,” “savages,” “monsters,” and “the worst of the worst.”

ICE has increasingly met quotas by arresting immigrants outside of immigration check-ins and courtrooms: yesterday Dina Arévalo of My San Antonio reported that ICE arrested five immigrants, including three children, outside of an immigration court after a judge had said they were no longer subject to removal proceedings. The officers used zip ties on all five individuals.

At stake is the turn of the United States away from democracy and toward the international right wing. Yesterday the U.S. State Department notified Congress that it intends to use the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to promote “Democracy and Western Values.” On Tuesday a senior advisor for that bureau, Samuel Samson, who graduated from college in 2021, explained that the State Department intends to ally with the European far right to protect “Western civilization” from current democratic governments.

It also plans to turn the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which manages the flow of people into the U.S., into an “Office of Remigration” to “actively facilitate” the “voluntary return of migrants” to other countries and “advance the president’s immigration agenda.”

“Remigration” is a term from the global far right. As Isabela Dias of Mother Jones notes, its proponents call for the “mass expulsion of non–ethnically European immigrants and their descendants, regardless of immigration status or citizenship, and an end to multiculturalism.” Of the congressional report, a person who works closely with the State Department told Marisa Kabas of The Handbasket: “All of it is pretty awful with some pieces that definitely violate existing law and treaties. But institutionalizing neo-Nazi theory as an office in the State Department is the most blatantly horrifying.”

This concept is behind not only the expulsion of undocumented immigrants, but also the purge of foreign scholars and lawful residents. The Supreme Court blessed this purge today when, during the period that litigation is underway, it allowed the administration to end immigration paroles for about 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela admitted under a Biden-era program, instantly making them undocumented and subject to deportation.

The court decided the case on the shadow docket, without briefings or explanation. In a dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote: “[S]omehow, the Court has now apparently determined…that it is in the public’s interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims.”

Jackson added a crucial observation. The court, she wrote, “allows the Government to do what it wants to do regardless [of the consequences], rendering constraints of law irrelevant and unleashing devastation in the process.”

Vor dem Hintergrund massiv gestiegener geopolitischer Spannungen und geschwächter internationaler Organisationen rief Alabali-Radovan bei der Eröffnung der Hamburger Nachhaltigkeitskonferenz am Montag zu verstärkter Zusammenarbeit auf. Sie warnte davor, dass Klimawandel, Konflikte und Hunger Millionen Menschen bedrohten und zur Flucht zwängen. Die Herausforderungen seien so groß wie nie, der Nutzen internationaler Zusammenarbeit werde weltweit aggressiv in Frage gestellt, so Alabali-Radovan.

Die Ministerin nutzte ihren Auftritt in Hamburg für scharfe Kritik an Israel. Was in Gaza zu sehen sei, sei eine „menschengemachte Katastrophe“. Jedes staatliche Handeln unterliege der Verhältnismäßigkeit, es könne kein militärisches Ziel sein, dass Kinder verhungerten. Die israelische Regierung müsse den Zugang für humanitäre Hilfe dauerhaft ermöglichen.

Die Hamburger Nachhaltigkeitskonferenz fand zum zweiten Mal statt; initiiert wurde sie 2024 unter der Ampel-Regierung. Bei der Eröffnung sagte Olaf Scholz (SPD), es solle ein Signal zur Aufholjagd ausgehen in Bezug auf die Ziele der Weltgemeinschaft für eine nachhaltige Entwicklung. Bis 2030 sollten unter anderem die extreme Armut sowie Hunger und Unterernährung verschwinden. Schon länger ist klar, dass die meisten Ziele unerreichbar sind. Zuletzt aber hat sich die Lage in vielen Entwicklungsländern massiv verschlechtert. Es fehlt an Geldern und Perspektiven, nicht zuletzt in Folge der Abwicklung der Hilfsorganisation USAID unter Donald Trump.

Sparkurs und Zölle treffen die Ärmsten

Zu beobachten sei ein massiver Abzug von Geldern in der internationalen Zusammenarbeit zu einer Zeit, in der es mehr denn je davon brauche, sagte der Leiter der UN-Entwicklungsprogramms UNDP, Achim Steiner. In Bezug auf den von den USA losgetretenen Zollkonflikt warnte er, dieser treffe vor allem die Ärmsten. Rebecca Greenspan von der UN-Konferenz für Handel und Entwicklung, UNCTAD, warnte, die 40 am wenigsten entwickelten Staaten der Welt würden durch die von den USA erhobenen Zölle massiv beschädigt, obwohl sie nur einen Bruchteil zum Handelsdefizit Amerikas beitrügen.

Die Nachhaltigkeitskonferenz setze den Attacken gegen die „regelbasierte Ordnung“ etwas entgegen, sagte Alabali-Radovan; in Hamburg träfen sich „die Weltoffenen“. Viele Teilnehmer betonten, wie wichtig es sei, in diesen Zeiten miteinander zu sprechen. Allerdings bleibt offen, welche konkreten Ergebnisse daraus folgen. Verabschiedet wurde am Montag etwa eine Erklärung für eine nachhaltige Nutzung von Künstlicher Intelligenz, dabei handelt es sich allerdings nur um eine Absichtserklärung.",2025-06-02 13:20:40+00:00,https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nachhaltigkeitskonferenz-in-hamburg-110512882.html,

The buzz of Freetown gives way to the hushed calm of this pocket of pristine rainforest reserved for critically endangered western chimpanzees rescued from across Sierra Leone.

The quiet is necessary. These bright primates - closest related to humans in the animal kingdom - are easily disturbed and the ones living in Tacugama are particularly sensitive.

The more than 120 chimpanzees brought here are traumatised survivors of mistreatment, hunting and violent separation from their families in the wild.

They are now facing another existential threat. Illegal encroachment is eating away at the edges of the conservation area. Despite wildlife laws, forest has been cleared to make way for houses being constructed closer and closer to chimp enclosures.

""We've been issuing several warnings over the last year,"" says Tacugama founder Bala Amarasekaran. ""Four months ago - again - we gave a warning. Then we had presidential intervention say that some of this encroachment will be stopped. It started very well for the first month then everything stopped again and we are back at square one. So, we are very tired and very stressed.""

Thirty years ago, Mr Amarasekaran appealed to the government to donate land and partner with him to create a sanctuary for the protection of the abused orphaned chimps he was finding across Freetown. Today, land in the Western Area Forest Reserve is being grabbed right under the government's nose.

""The government has been very good in terms of helping us in every way - however we expect the leadership to be more firm,"" says Mr Amarasekaran.

""When we talk to them, they are all with us. They all want to help. But when it comes to action it looks like some of the departments that have the mandate to institute certain laws and take the necessary law enforcement action are not acting.""

Sanctuary closes its doors to focus on conservation, rehabilitation and research

Tacugama has grown to become Sierra Leone's most popular tourist attraction over the last three decades. But in a stand against the fast-approaching illegal encroachment, the sanctuary has closed its doors to visitors to focus on conservation, rehabilitation and research.

""It is not a tourist attraction - we made it become a tourist attraction. It is supposed to be an orphanage for rescued chimpanzees,"" Mr Amarasekaran says.

""They are used to us and some visitors but they will start to see strangers come and that is where the problems start. They are not comfortable with strangers - don't forget it is the stranger who killed their mother. It is the stranger that wiped out their group.""

'A complex problem'

We asked Sierra Leone's government spokesperson and minister of information and civic education, Chernor Bah, about the illegal encroachment.

""It is a complex problem. You have a city that is growing. People need places to stay and we have not done the best job in terms of enforcing all these limitations,"" he replied. ""Some of our agents seem to have been complicit in allocating and giving people land in places they are not supposed to stay. So, I don't think I can sit here and say we have done enough - there is much more we can do.

""[Tacugama] is probably our most cherished and significant wildlife asset in the country.""

A national symbol for tourism

In 2019, the government designated the western chimpanzee as the national animal and national symbol for tourism. The image of a chimp is now etched in Sierra Leonean passports, a result of Tacugama's advocacy Mr Amarasekaran and his team hope will entrench a love and respect for chimps that will curb the need for intervention.

""We wanted something more - that is how the national animal bill came through,"" says Mr Amarasekaran.

""We thought if the agencies that are mandated to do all the law enforcement are not active and effective, then maybe we need to create a synergy between the people and the animals.""

Chimpanzees hunted for bushmeat

But chimpanzees are still being hunted as bushmeat for food across Sierra Leone and baby chimps are being torn from their families to be kept as illegal pets. Tacugama's latest rescue is only eight months old.

Baby Asana is frail with thinning hair and is being nursed back to health by his chimp mum, Mama P, when we meet him. He was rescued after an informant sent a video of Asana wearing human clothes and being mistreated as an illegal pet in Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city.

""For me as the founder of the sanctuary, I feel defeated,"" says Mr Amarasekaran with Asana being cared for behind him.

""These chimps shouldn't be arriving here if we have done enough work outside - there shouldn't be any killings, there shouldn't be any rescues. That is the time when I can say that I achieved something.""

Research from the Jane Goodall Institute identified that between five and 10 chimpanzees die for every surviving rescued chimpanzee. And with the sanctuary closed, much-needed public advocacy work will take a hard hit.

'Until I came to the sanctuary, I didn't see a chimpanzee'

""I'm really concerned because I only even started to experience chimpanzees when I started working here. I knew that we had chimps here. But until I came to the sanctuary, I didn't see a chimpanzee,"" says 25-year-old Tacugama communications officer, Sidikie Bayoh.

""Now, we are at a situation where we are closed indefinitely but what if this becomes something wherein we can never open the sanctuary again for people to visit? Then you will have all these young Sierra Leoneans never fully understanding what their national animal is.""

The closure also means there will be no revenue from visitors at a time when USAID funding has been halted.

He then shrugs and smiles knowingly, adding: ""We are very resilient - we are like chimpanzees. So, we will manage somehow.""",2025-06-02 12:32:00+00:00,https://news.sky.com/story/famous-chimpanzee-sanctuary-faces-existential-threat-from-illegal-land-grab-13378202,

Sin embargo, si se realiza un análisis de los nombres más utilizados entre la población española, el nombre de Lucía desciende considerablemente hasta la posición número quince. El motivo principal es que la popularidad de este nombre es relativamente reciente, y lo llevan las personas que tienen una edad media de 25 años, siendo el total de personas que lo usan 220.393.

Los tradicionales siguen siendo los líderes en la lista de los más utilizados, entre los hombres se encuentra el de Antonio con un total de 603.004 y entre las mujeres, el nombre compuesto de María Carmen con 624.368. El rango de edad de las personas que tienen estos dos nombres, es de 68.1 años entre ellos y de 58,3 entre ellas. Este dato revela que, incluso siendo actualmente los más populares, en un futuro cercano podrían llegar a desaparecer, debido a un cambio en la sociedad de ahora, que provoca que ya no se escojan estos como primera opción.

A María Carmen le sigue el nombre de María con 551.105 y el de Carmen con 340.920, lo cual refleja claramente, que estos dos han sido por décadas los favoritos entre la ciudadanía.

En la otra cara de la moneda se encuentran los nombres que ya apenas se escuchan y están apunto de desaparecer. Acindino, Frumencio y Basilides son los que más riesgo tienen entre los nombres masculinos y Acracia o Fraternidad entre los femeninos. La edad media de las personas que llevan este nombre es de 85 años, por ello, lo más probable es qué en un par de décadas no haya rastro de ellos en los registros.

There are few more jarring sights in New York City than a Cybertruck. Their sharp corners and general air of menace are at odds with the city’s other, more charming street trash. My friend Ali told me she hates seeing them around. When she spots a Cybertruck, she sticks her arm out and gives the driver an extended thumbs-down as they pass by.

A few years ago, Teslas were a status symbol: sleeker, more expensive, modern-day Priuses with mild sex appeal. Cars that projected, “I want to feel better about polluting the planet, so I’m driving electric.” Without fail, every time I visited Los Angeles pre-2024, beautiful friends with silky blonde hair, Instagram follower counts that ended with a k, and left-leaning politics prompting them to share infographics and GoFundMes with those followers would pick me up for dinner in their Teslas. In the shotgun seat, they’d let me click around on the screen like we were playing a video game. They’d tell me about their charging ports in their garages at home, and they’d mention how nice it was to not shell out money for the city’s preposterous gas prices. I’d picture them on an average Tuesday whipping around, dabbing on lip gloss in the rearview mirror, tossing keys to a valet, one of hundreds in a fleet of glimmering pods shimmying along the 405 like silver salmon swimming upstream.

Teslas were on track to become the it car — an entry point into becoming a modern person with places to be. In 2023, over 1.8 million Teslas were delivered in the U.S., a significant number for a country still heavily reliant on gasoline. In those days, just after his acquisition of Twitter, Musk was mostly understood as a zany tech billionaire who wanted to put us all on Mars. Not great, but not quite as easy to pin down. But throughout 2024, Musk cozied his way up to Donald Trump. Despite previously making his disdain for the president known, Musk joined Trump on stage in October of that year in a black “Make America Great Again” cap, doing that infamous jump to consummate his endorsement. Since then, those who had once relished driving their electric cars have learned that status symbols, like a coveted handbag or shoe du jour, are fickle things.

Beth Braunstein, a 66-year-old L.A.-based Tesla driver who works in drug and alcohol recovery, told me the cars were once so popular that other Angelenos got in her Model Y by accident, thinking it was their own. Now, she can’t wait to get rid of it. “As soon as my lease is up, it’s buh-bye,” she said. Her family started leasing the car two years ago after her son totaled their BMW and anticipates turning it in this December. (Most leases, essentially two- to three-year-long car rentals, offer the option to purchase the car after the agreement ends. Braunstein attempted to end the lease sooner, but said it was “ridiculously expensive.”) Even when she chose the car, she thought Musk was an “asshole,” but went with the Tesla because she was offered a deal.

The deal, writ large, has soured. Musk pledged a quarter of a billion dollars toward Trump and his campaign and appointed himself “First Buddy” as well as an “unpaid special government employee” spearheading the unofficial governing organization, DOGE, or the “Department of Government Efficiency.” In collaboration with the Trump administration, DOGE has caused tens of thousands of federal employees to leave their jobs, cut 80 percent of USAID programs, and gutted DEI programs across the country. Braunstein regrets her decision. “I don’t want to have an association with Elon, and I don’t want to give him any money,” she said. She’s so perturbed by the Musk and Trump crony hour, she’s stopped watching the news to avoid seeing them. “It churns my stomach,” she said.

The overall effect of Musk’s policies and personality has turned Teslas from aspirational to odious. He’s cringe to an astonishing degree — allegedly faking his gaming stats, starting beef publicly with his own daughter, and his evident, unending desire to be thought of as cool. As Rebecca Shaw put it in The Guardian, “I have been prepared for evil, for greed, for cruelty, for injustice — but I did not anticipate that the people in power would also be such huge losers.”

“I used to love valeting my car,” said Dominique, an executive based in Chicago and who works in DEI. She asked for her last name to be omitted out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration. “I wanted to save the planet and buy a responsible car.” Her unease about her car slowly grew along with Musk’s involvement in Trump’s campaign, but hit a peak in March, shortly after the tech CEO wielded a chainsaw onstage at CPAC. One afternoon, leaving a monthly brunch meetup with her close friends, one noticed Dominique’s bright-red Tesla waiting for her. “Oh … that’s your car?” she said, to Dominique. She seemed confused that her friend, whose work is dedicated to advocacy, was driving a MAGA-coded vehicle. “I was like ‘Yes, I know, I know!’” Dominique told me. “I was physically embarrassed and ashamed to get in that car.”

This feeling is resulting in losses for Musk. Tesla’s stock plummeted just after Trump’s inauguration and has failed to fully regain its footing. In March of this year, the company experienced a 23 percent decrease in revenue from the year before and a 65 percent decrease in earnings per share. Several people I know have either sold their Teslas or had family members scramble to sell theirs on account of Musk’s political meddling, and trade-ins are on the rise. “I went to Carvana and Carmax to see what I could get [for my Tesla],” Dominique told me. “Every day, the price was dropping. I was going to be $15,000 to $20,000 upside down. I was like, Oh, gosh, selling it wouldn’t be a smart financial decision.” She feels stuck: lose money, or lose face? At the moment, she plans on keeping the Tesla, but is eagerly test-driving other cars. As for brunch with her friends, she plans on parking around the corner next time.

While there have been actual attacks against cars and dealerships, it’s the everyday, human-to-human interactions that really get to the drivers. Members of the “Tesla Lounge” community on Reddit lament getting yelled at or being flashed printed-out, pointed signs that say “ewww, a tesla.” On TikTok, flipping Teslas and Cybertrucks off is now an everyday practice, practically akin to the “Jeep wave.” Influencers spotted with Cybertrucks, launched in late 2023, popularized through 2024 and nonexempt from the “we didn’t know Musk had bad politics” crop of cars, are catching heat.

Ruby Palmerin, a lifestyle content creator, posted a well-circulated TikTok ceremoniously announcing the unfollowing of one of her favorite influencers. Her crime: purchasing a Cybertruck. “That said a lot about their character. I immediately unfollowed and blocked them. It’s similar to the saying, ‘Why is everything so political?’ It is political,” Palmerin said. “I understand people had Teslas beforehand, and it’s difficult to sell, but getting a Tesla after shows your stance and shows how insensitive you are and out of touch.” Following or even engaging with content creators who own Teslas is now markedly uncool and can be seen a reflection of a consumer’s own politics. For Palmerin, it was better to distance herself from one of her favorite influencers than risk appearing, by the transitive property, a Musk-lover.

Pamela Wurst Ventriti, a liberal content creator so Democrat-pilled that the New York Post alleged she created “fan fiction” about Tim Walz, posted a joint confession and apology to her followers coming out as a Tesla owner. “Some of you guys might unfollow me,” she said. Ventriti then tells the story of how she and her family ended up with a Tesla, including needing to make it to little league, her husband’s commute, and, like Braunstein, being stuck in a lease. She ended with a plea: “Be kind to people on the road with Teslas, okay? We just wanted an affordable electric car!”

As the cars have sunk deeper into shameful, conservative associations today, those in similar boats as Ventriti are putting apologetic or camouflaging stickers on their Teslas. It’s their way of letting people know that their values aren’t those of the chainsaw-wielding, star-jumping Sim and presidential stool pidgeon. Dominique has slapped three stickers on her bumper: “Anti-Elon Tesla Club,” “I Was Just Trying to Save the Planet,” and “Harris-Walz.” Others cover their cars’ logos with black tape or purchase an “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” bumper sticker off Trump’s other billionaire buddy’s website, Amazon. Braunstein has an “oyota” sticker on the back of hers, with the Tesla logo acting as the T, to insinuate the car is a Toyota. “People have honked at me and had me roll down the window and ask me where I got the sticker,” she said.

No sticker, tape, or “oyota” camouflage can obscure the hard truth that the Tesla-as-status-symbol has gone rancid. They’ve gone the way of their trendy forefathers across industries — Dolce & Gabbana, Livestrong bands, ordering Papa John’s — on account of the men who make money from them. In addition to the political loggerheads its old devotees find themselves facing, it’s uncomfortable to share something in common with Musk. The car is no longer associated with minimalism and environmental justice, no longer a signal of sound politics and potential marker of empathy, but the personality, fashion sense, and overall wack mien of the person who brought these cars into the world and most represents them. “I’m very much anti-Elon and everything he stands for and represents — his Nazi hat, the way he views his trans daughter, the way he likes to reproduce with women to have control over them financially, and his idiotic stance and support of Trump,” Palmerin said. All politics aside: A Cybertruck “is so bulky and ugly.”

The Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale announced the planned shift during remarks at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on May 25.

The shift would see a range of digital health systems, currently hosted on US-based infrastructure, moved to local servers. These platforms include Kenya Health Information System (KHIS2), Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMFL), Afya KE, KenyaEMR, Chanjo KE, Damu KE, and Kemsa I-LMIS, all developed and maintained with USAID support. They are central to how Kenya tracks diseases, manages patient treatment, produces vaccines, and keeps rural health clinics running.

Kenya’s primary healthcare system would struggle to function without these platforms. Years of underfunding and systemic corruption have left the country heavily reliant on donor support, particularly from USAID. Cuts to aid under President Trump have exposed millions of Kenyans to gaps in essential health services, from HIV treatment to routine vaccinations.

“The recent challenges have underscored the vulnerabilities in our health data infrastructure,” Duale said. “It’s imperative that we invest in secure, locally managed data systems to ensure continuity and resilience in our healthcare delivery.”

Since March, Kenya’s health officials have reported losing access to data following USAID funding cuts and a subsequent shutdown ordered by the Trump administration.

USAID had committed $2.5 billion to Kenya in its 2020–2025 strategic plan, averaging $471 million in funding each year. An estimated 80% of this budget was earmarked for healthcare initiatives, covering areas such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, and vaccination programs.

In May, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) also reported that Kenya could not access data from the Kenya Health Information System, a crucial tool for disease surveillance and health planning.

Kenyan health officials have also warned that USAID cuts have exposed gaps in maintenance and technology, raising concerns about the country’s capacity to monitor public health and respond to outbreaks effectively.

“With donor funds curtailed, these platforms now suffer from maintenance gaps and technology shortages, severely hindering Kenya’s ability to monitor public health trends and respond promptly to emerging crises,” the Ministry said in April.

With Kenya facing budget constraints, it remains unclear how quickly local systems will be rolled out to handle the transition. In February, the Ministry said USAID funding cuts would cause $ 403.8 million (KES 52 billion) in the country’s health budget.

Many are on the brink of extinction.

They depend on support. In exile, under autocratic rule or during war, there are hardly any opportunities to run media outlets commercially. Meanwhile, these outlets are more important than ever as independent sources of information.

However, the new US government is undermining their role. President Trump’s decision to cut funding to the US Agency for Global Media and USAID threatens the existence of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and its publications and broadcasts. It also weakens dozens of other influential independent media outlets that were supported by US organisations.

Without free press no freedom for Ukraine, Belarus and Russia

Media projects and courageous journalists are a driving force in the fight for democratic freedoms and against authoritarianism, not only in their own countries and regions, but across Europe. Without the reporting, analysis and investigation carried out by independent journalist networks in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, we would find it very difficult to understand what is happening in these countries.

Interesting article? It was made possible by Voxeurop’s community. High-quality reporting and translation comes at a cost. To continue producing independent journalism, we need your support. or Donate

Without this knowledge, we would have no effective tools with which to resist and act against Russian state propaganda and disinformation strategies.

The destruction of independent media poses a serious threat to journalism in these countries. In Russia and Belarus, independent reporting is currently practically banned, with exiled media outlets often being the only source of accurate information.

The consequences of American policies are therefore fundamental and dramatic.

The only media outlets to benefit from the impending extinction of many independent outlets will be the Belarusian and Russian state channels, which will be able to spread their propaganda increasingly widely, both in their own countries and beyond. Citizens in both the East and West will suffer lasting damage to their information position as a result. This destruction cannot be accepted as a fait accompli.

Reliable information and pluralism in Europe's strategic interest

At the initiative of the Czech Republic and seven other European countries, the EU was asked to consider taking over the financing of RFE/RL. Early May, the Swedish government announced that it will provide RFE/RL with 20 million Swedish crowns in 2025. On 21 May, the EU approved an emergency €5.5 million injection for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

While they are a step in the right direction, it should not come at the expense of other news outlets, which also play an important role in factual and analytical reporting on Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other countries in Eastern Europe.

Safeguarding free information spaces in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia would be a significant step towards strengthening democracy and fostering future peace in Europe

We – journalists and editors of international media focusing specifically on Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, the Caucasus, Moldova and Central Asia – therefore wish to appeal to the European Commission, the European Council and individual European states to establish funds to bolster specialised journalism in and about these regions.

Support for this form of journalism could be incorporated into the ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030. After all, in this age of hybrid warfare, defence policy involves more than just weapons and personnel. Reliable information and pluralism are of strategic interest to Europe if the EU is to defend the democratic order. Safeguarding free information spaces in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia would be a significant step towards strengthening democracy and fostering future peace in Europe.

Within our capabilities, we, the initiators of this call, want to contribute to a public discussion on this matter and foster a support network for independent media struggling to survive in the years ahead. If desired, we are also ready to play an advisory and coordinating role.

However, without external assistance, we are powerless. Therefore, we are appealing to the European Commission, the European Council and individual European states to provide effective support for independent media outlets, which can now fill the gaps created by the Trump administration's decisions.",2025-06-02 10:25:35+00:00,https://voxeurop.eu/en/europe-support-independent-journalism-ukraine-belarus-russia/,

With foreign funding drying up, the “independent” news site now faces financial crisis.

Mediazona, the self-styled “independent” Russian outlet which partners with the BBC to track the deaths of Russian troops, requested hundreds of thousands of pounds directly from the British government, according to a tranche of leaked official documents.

Having mainly targeted Russians since its founding in 2014 by members of the Western-backed troupe of provocateurs known as Pussy Riot, Mediazona has largely remained off the radar of news consumers in the West. But that changed with the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Since the first day of the conflict, Mediazona has collaborated with the BBC Russian Service on a project tracking the deaths of Russian servicemen through open source methods. Mediazona describes “the work [as] meticulous and time-consuming,” requiring “relentless efforts of journalists.”

Who or what was footing the bill was left unmentioned in the description of the initiative, which was clearly designed to foment dissent and opposition to the proxy war among Russian citizens. Now, leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone indicate that between 2020 and 2023, Mediazona was in line for vast, secret grants for anti-Kremlin agitation from the British Foreign Office, under the official auspices of London’s opaque “Global Britain Fund.”

From Pussy Riot to Mediazona

Leaked files related to the information warfare effort show London earmarked a myriad of NGOs, rights groups, and news outlets in Russia to receive hundreds of thousands of pounds in order to undermine the Kremlin with propaganda and supposed civil society initiatives. Among the most prominent proposed repeat recipients was Mediazona.

One prospective grant from the Foreign Office would have transferred a whopping £300,000 between 2020 – 2023 to the outlet, which describes itself in the application as “Russia’s leading independent and socially focused media company.”



Boasting that “Mediazona contributes to the discussion of many legal and structural problems haunting Russian society and state, and also reports on foreign events (including in the UK) that have implications for Russians,” the proposal laid out the “key objectives set for Mediazona,” which included “[challenging] the official version of events by providing audiences with high-quality investigative journalism, compelling eye witness accounts and live feeds from the ground.” If approved, Mediazona would also “develop critical thinking amongst young Russians through the proactive use of social media networks and interactive content.”



The applicants bragged that Mediazona’s “prominent status on the Russian-language internet” meant “issues raised through its publications” would “have measurable resonance, stimulating constructive engagement between multiple stakeholder groups including public officials.”

Mediazona would be expected to produce “around 120 news articles per week, at least 18 investigative reports per month and a series of online feeds delivered from crucial events across Russia.” The Foreign Office pledged, “this programming will serve to expose corruption and the abuse of power whilst bringing credible and authentic voices into the public domain.” In addition, the editorial team hoped to “forge new partnerships with key players in the Russian and international media landscape, thereby ensuring powerful multiplier effects.”



Elsewhere, the British Foreign Office received a petition for £150,000 over two years on behalf of Zona Prava, an NGO which was also founded by Pussy Riot. The organization would expose alleged human rights abuses in Russian prisons, via “public events” such as “hot lines, round tables, seminars, information events with the invitation of public figures and government representatives.” Meanwhile, in “close cooperation” with Mediazona, Zona Prava would produce “at least 800 materials in federal and regional media… at least 10 videos” and potentially one or two documentaries.



British intel circumvents ‘foreign agent’ law

The leaked documents make clear that the British were aware that their activities were illegal under Moscow’s Foreign Agent law. A funding application for Equal Rights Trust, a Global Britain Fund recipient charged with lawfare operations referred to cryptically as “targeted strategic litigation” explicitly describes a British government-funded effort to evade the new law. “As part of our current project” being financed by the UK Foreign Office, ERT wrote that it “has undertaken an extensive risk assessment of the Russian context, including commissioning an independent consultant to produce a report on the Foreign Agent Law.” As a result, “ERT is now well-versed” in various “procedures to mitigate the risks of transferring funds to Russia,” which “allowed for the ongoing successful implementation of activities despite the Foreign Agent law.”

These procedures included “diversifying means of transferring of funds, on-going assessment on methods of transfer, clear lines of communication with the recipient on when and how transfers are made, neutral codes and payment reference for bank records, and maximum amounts per transfer and numbers of transfers using the same method.”



ERT concluded that “it is simpler and safer for all concerned to work without a formal partner to distribute funds to project beneficiaries,” and instead “work with a series of informal partners through consultancy agreements.” ERT was said to have “utilised this approach to great success in similar environments.”

It is unknown if the Global Britain projects involving Mediazona went ahead, and, if so, whether they used such “procedures” to launder the money. But the outlet’s long standing public alliance with the British state, via the project mapping Russian war casualties with the BBC’s Russian Service, highlights the outlet’s perceived utility as a conduit for anti-Kremlin agitprop.

Mediazona lashes out at damaging leaks with libelous allegations

If financing did flow to Mediazona under “Global Britain,” it would not have been the first time London covertly supported the group’s activities. In February 2021, leaks reported by The Grayzone revealed how Mediazona had, alongside Meduza, received covert backing from British intelligence in the form of “audience segmentation and targeting support” some years prior. The assistance formed part of a wider clandestine effort to “weaken the Russian state’s influence.” While Mediazona’s top brass issued no official statement or response to the disclosures, a retort of sorts was promptly forthcoming.

Days after this outlet’s reporting appeared, Mediazona published a sensational exclusive, claiming Amnesty International’s decision to rescind Western-backed, imprisoned Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny’s “prisoner of conscience” status resulted from a sinister Kremlin-orchestrated “campaign,” led by “individuals tied” to Russian state broadcaster RT. The supposed culprits were The Grayzone’s Aaron Maté, and a freelance writer and translator known as Katya Kazbek – neither of whom were tied to RT in any way.

Maté’s apparent sin was revealing how Amnesty had revoked Navalny’s status “given the fact that he advocated violence and discrimination and he has not retracted such statements.” For her part, Kazbek stood accused of posting a viral Twitter thread documenting Navalny’s lengthy history of racism, xenophobia, and association with and promotion of Neo-Nazi figures and groups, which he consistently refused to repudiate. She was subsequently doxxed by Bellingcat editor Natalia Antonova, who revealed sensitive private details, including her home address.

Amnesty International issued a statement explicitly denying “external pressure” from any source influenced its decision to remove Navalny from its list of “prisoners of conscience.” Nevertheless, Mediazona’s hatchet job was promptly translated into English by Meduza, where its charges were seized upon by mainstream Navalny endorsers and Western news outlets, including the BBC.

Meduza’s then-investigative editor, Alexey Kovalev, appeared to acknowledge the bogus story was revenge for articles exposing Britain’s clandestine support of both Mediazona and Kovalev’s employer, Meduza. In a 2021 tweet, Kovalev accused the author of this article of having “unleashed a careless conspiracy theory,” insisting that the leaked documents exposing those ties were “fake.” In closing, he sneered: “consider us square.”



But the documents, and recent announcement by both Mediazona and Meduza, indicate that claims of secret Western sponsorship for the supposedly-independent outlets were anything but “fake.”

In a lengthy plea posted across their social media accounts entitled “Mediazona on the brink,” the group groaned that they were “running out of money” and urgently needed 5,000 monthly subscribers just “to stay afloat.” After Western sanctions forced Visa and Mastercard out of Russia, “funding from our readers” dried up, they wrote, explaining that the Ukraine proxy war’s outbreak “collapsed” the outlet’s business model “overnight.”

Mediazona claimed they’d already begun laying off staff as a result of budget cuts, warning if their subscriber target was not reached, layoffs “will have to continue.” Before the war, they claimed, the outlet was funded “almost [emphasis added] entirely” by reader donations. This glaring caveat strongly suggests they had been at least partially backed by government funding – a notion seemingly confirmed in a February 28 Euractiv interview with Nikita Dulnev, director of Mediazona’s Central Asia branch, who directly linked his outlet’s financial woes to the Trump administration’s shutdown of USAID.

Dulnev was described by Euractiv as one of many “media professionals in Eastern European countries” who fear Washington’s “abrupt funding cut” to local propaganda projects “could inflict lasting damage on the region’s media infrastructure.” In the article, Dulnev lamented, “for years, we had some support and didn’t diversify much. That’s why we had to pause our work.” Dulnev’s LinkedIn profile lists him as formerly employed by the “Khodorkovsky network.”

That international anti-Kremlin propaganda group was formed by London-residing exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was released with members of Pussy Riot in December 2013 as a “magnanimous gesture” by Moscow towards the Russian opposition. Since then, Khodorkovsky has openly plotted Vladimir Putin’s downfall, though the full extent of this agitation is unknown.

Pussy Riot cofounders Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova launched Mediazona almost immediately after their release alongside Khodorkovsky. A 2014 press release announcing their outlet’s founding explicitly linked Mediazona’s creation to the lack of “space for anything in [Russian] media that criticizes Putin’s policies.”

It was thus evident from day one that Mediazona was intended to serve as an extension of Pussy Riot’s political activism in Russia, which previously included Tolokonnikova’s participation in a public orgy at a Moscow museum in 2008, and other incendiary, criminal acts that would get perpetrators jailed almost anywhere in the world. The outlet quickly became a dependable megaphone for Western-sponsored opposition figure Alexei Navalny until his February 2024 death.

A February 2025 New York Times report confirmed Meduza had been in receipt of unacknowledged funds from USAID, a traditional US intelligence cutout, amounting to 15% of its annual income. This budgetary shortfall, they claimed, was sufficient to put the outlet’s entire future in jeopardy, and inflict more damage on its operations than previous alleged “cyberattacks, legal threats and even poisonings of its reporters.” The New York Times noted that financing for opposition media outlets from other foreign governments was “tiny in comparison with American funding” cut by the Trump administration.

Moreover, “traditional media supporters” such as the CIA-connected Ford Foundation and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations have “abandoned much of [their] media funding” outright. This abrupt lack of overseas bankrolling for anti-Kremlin propaganda operations was parenthetically acknowledged in Mediazona’s desperate March 31 plea for reader donations, which lamented that “grants from various foundations” are no longer forthcoming “in the current situation.” It appears Mediazona is also a victim of the US-led cessation of foreign funding for ‘independent’ media projects targeting enemy states.

As funding from Western governments dries up, Pussy Riot has launched a page on OnlyFans. The group’s “fetish/kink friendly” official profile on the website, widely used by sex workers, promises paying subscribers “daily exclusive photos and videos,” “one on one chatting,” “custom content and items,” and “exceptional service for all your personal requests.”

At the time of publication, promotional offers on three and six-month subscriptions are offered. It is unknown how many NATO member states, if any, have availed themselves of the opportunity.",2025-06-02 10:00:00+00:00,https://www.activistpost.com/bbcs-independent-russian-partner-begged-uk-govt-for-funds-files-show/,

Last week, the ""worst ultra-billionaire on earth,"" higher than any of his SpaceX rockets ever got, lurched to the end of his rampage through humane governance, leaving in his feckless, malignant wake unparalleled devastation - agencies ravaged, services gutted, a multitude of jobs and the expertise behind them lost, 300,000 people around the world, two-thirds children - 103 an hour - consigned to early death. ""We’ll miss you,” said no one ever. Fuck that guy.

Musk's reign of terror as a moronically named ""Special Government Employee"" - did he get stickers? - heading a made-up ""Department of Breaking Shit You Don’t Understand"" officially, suitably wrapped up in a surreal farewell scene at a gaudily tricked-out Oval Office where, still grovelling, he declared the once-somber, now-trashy landmark site ""finally has the majesty it deserves."" Sporting a black eye, black ""Dogefather"" tshirt and wildly hallucinatory air, he thanked his dark overlord for ""the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending"" while his dementia-ridden boss praised him as ""a friend and adviser,"" with coincidentally deep pockets, whose ""service to America is without comparison in modern history,"" which you can take alotta different ways. ""This isn't the end of DOGE, it's more the beginning,"" said Musk. ""It's a way of life,"" also of needless, barbaric, untimely death.

Trump nodded along sagely before babbling, ""Elon gave an incredible service,"" which isn't a thing. ""He’s done a lot of things,"" he added helpfully. ""He's a very good person."" He's also perhaps the most despised person on the planet, except maybe for Bibi, which is why Trump evidently cut him loose well before mid-terms. ""We have to get a lot of votes,"" he blurted at one point. ""We can't be cutting - we need a lot of support."" Of course now so does Musk's floundering business empire, probably because in his private and public efforts he applied the same toxic move-fast-and-break-things attributes - ignorance, arrogance, entitlement, carelessness, a sociopathic lack of empathy his addled mind deems ""weakness"" - with the same disastrous effects. It's thus unsurprising his short brutal tenure at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has met with ""deservedly vicious reviews.""

""Elon Musk'sLegacy Is Disease, Starvation and Death,"" declared The New York Times. ""Go, Elon, and Never Darken Our Doors Again,"" intoned the appalled American Prospect, which noted, ""It's hard to think of any other unelected official who has done so much harm (in) such a short period of time."" They went on, ""Musk is one of the most malevolent people ever to hold a position of influence in American politics. His actions, without exaggeration, have devastated the health and security of American society and directly caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people all over the world, with millions more to follow given the course that he has set."" The Daily Show's Leslie Jones offered a more succinct and profane, but similarly themed take on the catastrophic debris left behind by the pernicious likes of Musk et al: ""I can't believe America may be ended by these fucking loser incels.""

Many skeptics warn Musk's much-touted departure is in fact a ""fake retreat,"" with his ""mess of half-realized plans"" and over-stated, badly executed ""achievements"" simply taken up by an army of about 50 young, unvetted DOGE tech bros and flunkies who like their boss don't know how things work, aren't interested in learning and don't care how many people they hurt. Embedded by executive order in agencies across the government and digging in ""like an autonomous termite machine,"" they're just as intent on mining data, cutting services, greenlighting corporate abuses and otherwise wreaking havoc. ""Musk's departure obscures but does not actually change the continuity of DOGE's staff and mission to destroy everything that protects the public from the depredations of the most rapacious oligarchs,"" said one oversight expert ""DOGE is still hungry. We've still got to feed the fucking dog.""

Of course Musk failed to achieve anything close to his blithe goal of cutting $2 trillion from an allegedly bloated budget. in what experts call ""arson of a public asset,"" estimates of his actual savings by cutting from all the wrong places range from $100 billion to $2 billion, one-thirty-fifth of 1% of the federal budget, ""otherwise known as budget dust."" Either way, his cuts to vital, profitable agencies like the IRS and National Parks will simultaneously cost taxpayers about $135 billion in lost revenue and rehiring/ re-training costs. A(nother) rich white guy with zero accountability, Musk played the victim, whining about ""the banal evil of bureaucracy"" and becoming ""a bogeyman""; he declined to mention the obscene $170 billion more he's raked in after attacking offices investigating his dodgy businesses, scoring $38 billion in government contracts, and pressing countries to buy Starlink.

Meanwhile, he did incalculable damage. At home, he destroyed thousands of jobs, billions in contracts, mountains of institutional knowledge, especially in science, health care, childhood cancer research. He hobbled Social Security, the National Weather Service, disease mitigation, veterans' services, homelessness programs, the U.S. Institute of Peace, now plagued with rats and roaches. He did the Seig Heil, CPAC Chainsaw, fake savings tracker, White House Tesla mini-mall, cheesehead trying to buy a judge, what-five-things-did-you-do-this-week claptrap. He did lots of drugs - ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD, cocaine, Ambien, Adderall, so much ketamine he's now reportedly incontinent. He famously brought his 5-yrear-old son to the Oval office, where X wiped oblivious boogers on the Resolute Desk, an apt, gross, sublime metaphor for what his heedless father has left us all with.

He also killed many, many people, aka ""pioneered new methods of increasing death tolls in emerging markets."" Of his multiple crimes and acts of malfeasance, Musk's mindless shuttering of USAid, and the carnage it swiftly caused, is by far the worst. Even the backstory is repulsive: His infamous February post, defining a vile legacy, bragging, ""We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper."" He could have “gone to some great parties,"" smirked the white supremacist ghoul, but instead he shredded a global agency that has fed and cared for millions of poor, sick, starving, marginalized people, especially children, around the world, particularly in Africa, thus abruptly cutting off almost 85% of live-saving funding because he breezily denounced it as ""a radical-left political psy-op” - MAGA-ese for keeping alive thousands of at-risk babies starving, caught in war-torn countries, born with HIV.

Just one example: Simply halting PEPFAR, a landmark, George W. Bush-era program that has saved over 26 million lives by giving mothers a ""miracle"" anti-HIV drug that costs less than 12 cents a day, has already killed an estimated 54,500 adults and 5,800 children; about 1,500 babies have been born HIV-positive every day since January 21, and many more will follow. Fact-aversive MAGA denies this: Marco Rubio just told Congress, ""No children are dying on my watch...No one has died because of USAid"" - a claim called ""ludicrous"" by many critics. They include Nicholas Kristof, who wrote of one victim of hundreds of thousands. Evan Anzoo was an orphan born with H.I.V. in South Sudan who America kept alive with antiretroviral HIV drugs for five years; soon after a too-rich, blitzed-out, witless white supremacist blocked access to his medication, Evan died of an opportunistic infection.

In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald said of Tom and Daisy, ""They were careless people...They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness...and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" Now erratic Space Nazi Musk, ""a poisonous human being"" and ""an evil piece of garbage,"" is purportedly, partly moving on while food rots in warehouses in hungry countries around the world and once-manageable diseases rage out of control. ""In government,"" says one bitter advocate, ""it’s much easier to tear things down than it is to build things up."" Still, at DOGE, ""tasked with getting rid of unnecessary bullshit within the government,"" things are looking up. ""We’ve been searching everywhere to find bloated, unnecessary, overrated, overpaid, unwanted, heinous waste to get rid of,"" reportsThe Shovel: ""Turns out he was running the place.""

Unsicherheit und Angst nähmen zu. Es sei dennoch nicht Zeit für Mutlosigkeit.

Veranstalter der Konferenz sind das Bundesentwicklungsministerium, das Entwicklungsprogramm der Vereinten Nationen, eine Stiftung des Hamburger Mäzens Michael Otto und die Stadt Hamburg.

Der Teufel hat hier viele Gestalten: Die Gender-Ideologie. Die Transgender-Bewegung. Feministinnen. Sexualaufklärung. Und natürlich: LGBTQ. Die Redner im Hotel Boma Inn spucken die Buchstaben eher aus, als dass sie sie aussprächen. Und man ist sich einig: Der Teufel kommt aus dem Westen.

Dieser Meinung sind nicht nur die Afrikaner. Gerade steht Ricky Chelette auf der Bühne, ein Baptistenpfarrer aus Texas. Er ist eine Grösse bei der Behandlung von, wie er es nennt, «sexueller Verwirrung». Chelette versucht Homosexuelle zu heilen.

Von der Bühne herab ruft er: «Wir im Westen sind hervorragend darin, unsere Sünden zu exportieren.» Er meint das sarkastisch. «Ich bitte euch um Vergebung.»

Ricky Chelette, Baptistenpfarrer aus Texas. PD

Chelette ist Anfang 60 und zum ersten Mal in Afrika. Er hat eine volle Pastorenstimme, die Säle füllt. Er erzählt von Adam und Eva im Paradies. Wie Eva den Apfel ass und die Sünde in die Welt brachte. «Bis heute versucht der Teufel unsere Leben zu zerstören», sagt der Pfarrer. Indem er Männer in Frauenkleider steckt oder Verhütungsmittel verteilt. «Er kommt auch hierher zu euch.»

Hierher nach Kenya, Afrika, das manche Fundamentalisten als letztes verbliebenes Paradies der traditionellen Werte sehen. Wo Männer noch Männer sind, Frauen Frauen und die Familie intakt.

Globaler Kulturkampf auch in Afrika

Der Anlass von Mitte Mai in Nairobi nennt sich die Panafrikanische Konferenz für Familienwerte. Die Gäste kommen aus zwei Dutzend Ländern. Am Bühnenrand vor Ricky Chelette stecken die Flaggen der Teilnehmerländer: Tansania, Malawi, Kongo-Kinshasa, Nigeria und weitere afrikanische Länder, die USA, Grossbritannien, Frankreich, Polen, die Schweiz.

Es ist keine riesige Konferenz, weniger als 200 Personen sitzen im Saal. Doch sie steht für etwas Grösseres: für den globalen Kulturkampf, der sich auch in Afrika abspielt.

Deshalb schlug die Konferenz schon im Vorfeld Wellen. Kritiker sagten, hier planten religiöse Extremisten, wie sie sexuelle Minderheiten in Afrika weiter marginalisieren könnten. Sie würden angeleitet von Fundamentalisten aus den USA und Europa, die ihre Ideen und Millionen nach Afrika brächten. Gestärkt würden an der Konferenz für Familienwerte nicht Werte, sondern Hass.

Panelthema «LGBT enttarnen»

An der Konferenz selbst klingt es anders. Nicht nach Offensive, sondern nach einer Abwehrschlacht biblischen Ausmasses. Da redet sich zum Beispiel eine kenyanische Aktivistin in Rage. «Ich dachte, nur weisse Leute tun diese seltsamen Dinge, aber neulich rief mich der Rektor einer Mädchenschule zu Hilfe, weil die Mädchen übereinander herfielen. Schulen müssen geschlossen werden wegen Lesbentums. Es ist eine wahre Krise, meine Brüder und Schwestern!»

Schockiertes Aufstöhnen im Publikum. «Oh mein Gott», sagen mehrere. Im Saal sitzen Leute in traditionellen afrikanischen Gewändern, in Anzügen und in Alltagskleidern, viele sind jünger als 30 Jahre. Zwischen ihnen sitzen grauhaarige weisse Männer und ein paar weisse Frauen.

Die Konferenz dauert eine Woche. Die Vorträge und Panels haben Titel wie «Die Familie und die Gefahr des Globalismus», «LGBT enttarnen», «Stärkere Männer, stärkere Familien», «Bedrohung des Lebens: Wie umgehen mit Abtreibung».

Und immer geht es um den verdorbenen Westen, der seine Lasterhaftigkeit nach Afrika exportiert, so wie er einst den Kolonialismus brachte. In einer Pause sagt ein kenyanischer Teilnehmer: «Die Sünde ist wie ein Feuer. Es muss sich immer weiter ausbreiten. In Europa hat es bereits alle Büsche verbrannt. Nun kommt es hierher.»

Die Sünde kommt angeblich in Form westlicher Hilfsorganisationen und Regierungen, die in Afrika HIV-Medikamente, Sexualaufklärung und Toleranz für Homosexuelle verbreiten. Einer der Redner – ein Brite von Christian Voice UK – zählt minutenlang westliche Institutionen auf, die mit ihren Projekten in Afrika einen spirituellen Krieg angezettelt hätten: die Ford Foundation, die deutsche Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung, den American Jewish World Service, den «Globalisten George Soros».

50 Millionen für Afrika

Doch vielleicht ist die Sache komplizierter. Die Kritiker der Konferenz sagen, die Westler brächten nicht die Sünde nach Afrika. Sondern eher die Homophobie und den religiösen Extremismus, der eine Konferenz wie die in Nairobi überhaupt möglich macht. So lief das in der Kolonialzeit, als Missionare gegen alles hetzten, was angeblich wild und unzivilisiert war. So setzt es sich heute fort, wo westliche Fundamentalisten den Takt trommeln an einer panafrikanisch genannten Konferenz.

Die gegenwärtige Welle von Homophobie und ultrakonservativem Furor in Afrika rollte Mitte der nuller Jahre los. Damals kamen vermehrt amerikanische Evangelikale auf den Kontinent. Sie fanden fruchtbaren Boden. Religiöse, konservative Gesellschaften, in denen Familie und Kinder einen Stellenwert haben, den sie im Westen verloren hatten. Dazu in mehr als der Hälfte aller afrikanischen Staaten Gesetze, die homosexuelle Handlungen verboten. Sie waren in der Kolonialzeit von Europäern eingeführt worden. Umgesetzt wurden sie längst nicht mehr; Homosexualität war damals kein Thema, das die Länder gross bewegte.

Homosexualität war in Afrika nicht immer ein so grosses Reizthema wie jetzt. Gläubige einer LGBT-freundlichen Kirchgemeinde in Nairobi. Häufiger ist, dass Kirchen gegen Homosexuelle hetzen. Brian Inganga / AP

Das änderte sich. «Der Kampf gegen Homosexualität wurde zu einer Art Massenpsychose», sagt der belgische Politikwissenschafter Kristof Titeca. Er lehrt an der Universität Antwerpen, wo er die Aktivitäten der religiösen Rechten in Afrika untersucht. Titeca sagt, die amerikanischen Evangelikalen seien so erfolgreich gewesen, weil sich Homophobie mit einer antiwestlichen Pose verbinden lasse: Wehret den dekadenten Einflüssen der früheren Kolonialmächte.

In mehreren Ländern schlugen Parlamentarier Gesetze vor, die lange Gefängnisstrafen für Homosexualität vorsahen. 2012 klagten ugandische Menschenrechtler in den USA gegen den evangelikalen Pastor Scott Lively. Er hatte eng mit ugandischen Politikern zusammengearbeitet, die versuchten, die Todesstrafe für Homosexuelle einzuführen.

Neben Beratung gab es auch westliches Geld. Die Plattform Open Democracy errechnete 2020, dass fundamentalistische christliche Organisationen von 2007 bis 2018 mehr als 50 Millionen Dollar in Afrika ausgaben.

Polnische Organisation für «LGBT-freie Zonen»

Zwei Jahrzehnte nachdem westliche Pastoren und Aktivisten die homophobe Welle lostraten, hat sich diese längst verselbständigt. Das heisst nicht, dass die Fundamentalisten aus den USA und Europa keine Rolle mehr spielen. «Sie stellen Kontakte her, schaffen Netzwerke, bieten nach wie vor Hilfe an bei der Erarbeitung von Gesetzen», sagt der Entwicklungsforscher Titeca. Sie hälfen auch mit, Konferenzen zu organisieren wie jene in Nairobi. Diese haben sich in den vergangenen Jahren gehäuft, sie seien zu einer Art Wanderzirkus geworden.

Die Redner und die Sponsoren sind oft dieselben. So ist vor dem Konferenzsaal in Nairobi eine Plakatwand mit den Logos von einem Dutzend Organisationen aufgestellt. Zu sehen ist etwa das Logo von C-Fam, einer 1997 in Washington gegründeten amerikanischen Organisation, die Abtreibung und Transgenderrechte bekämpft. Oder von Ordo Iuris, einer katholischen Organisation, die in Polen an der Verschärfung des Abtreibungsgesetzes mitgearbeitet hat und sich für «LGBT-freie Zonen» einsetzt.

Die einflussreiche Aktivistin Sharon Slater ist seit über zwei Jahrzehnten in Afrika tätig. PD

Die vielleicht umtriebigste Organisation heisst Family Watch International. Ihre Gründerin, die Mormonin Sharon Slater, hat homo- und transsexuelle Personen als krankheitsanfällig und zur Pädophilie neigend beschrieben. Slater ist seit über zwei Jahrzehnten in Afrika tätig, sie unterhält gute Beziehungen zu Politikern, etwa zur ugandischen First Lady, die auch Bildungsministerin ist. Slater führt Anti-LGBT-Schulungen für afrikanische Politiker durch, in denen diese üben, in internationalen Organisationen zu verhandeln. Die Amerikanerin soll laut Recherchen auch massgeblich bei Anti-LGBT-Gesetzen mitgewirkt haben – zum Beispiel bei einem 2023 in Uganda verabschiedeten, das für bestimmte homosexuelle Handlungen die Todesstrafe vorsieht.

Warner aus dem Westen

Auch an der Konferenz in Nairobi ist Slater an vorderster Front dabei. Im Vorfeld gaben die vielen Amerikaner und Europäer, die an der Konferenz auftreten, zu reden. Ein Journalist postete ein Konferenzplakat auf X, das ausschliesslich weisse Redner zeigte. Ein Shitstorm folgte, Nutzer kommentierten: «Kolonisatoren benutzten einst die Bibel, nun sind es Konferenzen.» Die Organisatoren setzten daraufhin auch dunkelhäutige Köpfe auf das Plakat.

An der Konferenz selber stört sich niemand an den Rednern aus dem Westen. «Sie sind von Gott gesandt, um uns zu warnen», sagt der Kenyaner, der die westlichen Sünden mit einem Feuer verglichen hat, das sich auch in Afrika ausbreite. Einer der Konferenzorganisatoren, Charles Kanjama, ein Anwalt aus Nairobi, sagt: «Das ist keine Einbahnstrasse, sie sagen uns nicht, was wir tun sollen. Wir stärken einander gegenseitig.»

Laut Kristof Titeca, dem belgischen Entwicklungsforscher, gestalten die westlichen Aktivisten die Konferenz aktiv mit. «Sie entwerfen die Agenda», sagt er, sie hülfen mit Geld. Der Organisator Kanjama kontert: «Warum sollten wir kein Geld bekommen? Unsere Gegner bekommen aus dem Westen zehnmal so viel wie wir.»

Auch die First Lady spricht

Unter den Logos der vielen radikalkonservativen Organisationen vor dem Saal fällt eines aus der Reihe: das des kenyanischen Arbeitsministeriums. Es ist Ausdruck davon, wie eng die Beziehungen der religiösen Rechten zur afrikanischen Politik sind, in Kenya noch stärker als anderswo. Präsident William Ruto ist ein Evangelikaler, er lässt in der Präsidentenresidenz Messen lesen und vergiesst dabei gerne Tränen, um seine Frömmigkeit auszudrücken.

Seine Gattin Rachel Ruto hält an der Konferenz ein Grundsatzreferat. Die First Lady ist längst nicht die einzige Regierungsvertreterin an der Konferenz – mehrere Minister treten auf.

Auch der feurigste Vertreter der Anti-LGBT-Agenda in Kenyas Politik ist da. Peter Kaluma tritt an einem Morgen ans Rednerpult, kurz nach dem texanischen Konversionstherapeuten Chelette. Kaluma ist Parlamentarier, er hat 2023 eine Vorlage eingebracht, die dem ugandischen Gesetz stark ähnelt.

Nach der Übermittlung eines offiziellen Grussworts des Vorsitzenden des kenyanischen Parlaments spricht Kaluma über die Themen, die ihm am Herzen liegen: über Intersex-Personen («Wenn man genau hinschaut, kann man sehen, dass auch sie entweder Mann oder Frau und nicht beides gleichzeitig sind»), über HIV («Der Westen will, dass ihr euch ansteckt, damit er euch seine Medikamente verabreichen kann»). Am Ende spricht der Parlamentarier über sein Gesetzesprojekt, die «Vorlage zum Schutz der Familie». «Es geht voran», sagt er und verspricht den Anwesenden einen Besuch im Parlament, damit sie den Parlamentariern ins Gewissen reden können.

Der Messias Trump

Es gibt einen Namen, der an der Konferenz fast so oft fällt wie der von Gott oder dem Teufel: jener des amerikanischen Präsidenten. «Ich war der glücklichste Mensch, als Donald Trump gewählt wurde», sagt Peter Kaluma. «Trump verschafft uns Luft zum Atmen», sagt Charles Kanjama, der Organisator. «Wir müssen das Momentum nutzen», sagt ein südafrikanischer Konferenzredner.

Die Konferenzteilnehmer mögen so tun, als führten sie hier eine Abwehrschlacht gegen die westliche LGBT- und Abtreibungsagenda. Tatsächlich sind sie in der Offensive. Ihr mächtiger Verbündeter im Weissen Haus hat die amerikanische Entwicklungshilfebehörde USAID eingestampft – und damit viele Millionen gestrichen, mit denen die amerikanische Regierung in Afrika über Verhütung aufklärte oder HIV-infizierten Homosexuellen half.

Vor der Konferenz in Nairobi machte das Gerücht die Runde, der amerikanische Aussenminister Marco Rubio könnte teilnehmen. Er kommt nicht, stattdessen werden im Saal Videobotschaften von amerikanischen Republikanern verbreitet. Das Programm listet auch eine ehemalige Trump-Mitarbeiterin und Anti-Abtreibungs-Aktivistin auf.

Doch niemand sorgt für so viel Euphorie wie Donald Trump selber. Immer wieder erwähnen Redner, dass der amerikanische Präsident in einer seiner ersten Amtshandlungen ein Dekret unterzeichnete, das festhält, dass es nur zwei Geschlechter gebe. Mann und Frau.

Die Redner zitieren das, als handle es sich um eine Tat aus der Bibel. Offenbar kommt nicht nur der Teufel aus dem Westen. Sondern auch der Messias.",2025-06-02 03:30:00+00:00,https://www.nzz.ch/international/anti-lgbt-konferenz-in-afrika-christliche-fundamentalisten-warnen-ld.1884628,

４月１日、国連は、パレスチナ自治区ガザで世界食糧計画（ＷＦＰ）が支援するパン店２５軒全てが物資不足から営業を停止したにもかかわらず、イスラエルがガザには長期にわたり十分な食料があると主張したことは「馬鹿げている」と非難した。写真は、食事を待つパレスチナの子どもら。３月９日、ガザ南部のハンユニスで撮影（２０２５年 ロイター/Hatem Khaled）

Elon Musk is leaving DC not with a bang but a whimper…and, it appears, with some new enemies in the White House.

In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS, days after he announced he was departing DOGE, Musk insisted he has never been in lockstep with the Trump administration, despite being President Donald Trump’s self-proclaimed “first buddy.”

“It’s not like I agree with everything the administration does,” Musk said on CBS News’ Sunday Morning. “So it’s like, I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does. But we have differences of opinion. You know, there are things that I don’t entirely agree with.”

“But it’s difficult for me to bring that up in an interview,” Musk continued, “because then it creates a bone of contention. So then, I’m a little stuck in a bind, where I’m like, well, I don’t wanna, you know, speak up against the administration, but I also don’t wanna take responsibility for everything this administration’s doing.”

Less than 24 hours before Elon Musk announced that his time as a Special Government Employee was coming to a close, Musk expressed some “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration in an interview with CBS Sunday Morning correspondent David Pogue.

So what, exactly, didn’t Musk like? DOGE becoming the boogeyman of the administration, for one thing: “DOGE became the whipping boy for everything,” the world’s richest man complained. “If there was some cut, real or imagined, everyone would blame DOGE.” (In fact, poll after poll showed most Americans disliked DOGE, at least in part due to its lack of accountability and its slash-and-burn approach to critical government functions and personnel. That included killing more than two dozen grants administered by the Department of Labor that supported getting more women into fields including construction and manufacturing; dismantling USAID, the international humanitarian aid agency; impeding scientific research; and firing scores of federal workers, just to name a few examples.)

Musk said he was also “disappointed” to see the “massive spending bill,” which was passed by the Republican House last month and is now being debated in the Senate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade—a figure that would essentially render DOGE’s purported government savings of $175 billion pointless. Musk alleged that the bill “undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” adding, “I actually thought that, when this ‘big, beautiful bill’ came along, it’d be like, everything he’s done on DOGE gets wiped out in the first year.”

""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful. But I don't know if it could be both.""

Trump’s allies scrambled to counter Musk’s critiques on the Sunday shows. On NBC’s Meet the Press, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told host Kristen Welker he “sent a long text message to my good friend, Elon Musk, after he made those comments the other day,” adding that Musk and others “are missing…the tremendous and historic level of spending cuts that are also in the same package.” (Those “cuts” include the largest-ever proposed cuts to Medicaid, which could lead to 8 million people losing coverage. The cuts would target women’s health services offered by Planned Parenthood, coverage for abortions in Affordable Care Act plans, and gender-affirming care for all Medicaid patients, including transgender adults.) On CNN’s State of the Union, White House Budget Director Russ Vought claimed: “I love Elon. This bill doesn’t increase the deficit or hurt the debt,” before critiquing the CBO’s estimate.

There have been signs of Musk’s discontent prior to the CBS interview: for example, the time that he went after Peter Navarro, Trump’s top tariff guy, saying, “He ain’t built shit,” as I previously wrote. (In the CBS interview, when asked if Trump’s tariffs would affect his businesses, Musk demurred, replying, “Tariffs always affect things a little bit.”) But Trump seems to think Musk will be back before long: “Elon’s really not leaving,” he told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, as Musk stood nearby with a black eye he claimed his son gave him. “He’s going to be back and forth, I think. I have a feeling.”

But Musk seems more tepid about returning to the White House amid a myriad of business problems, including tanking Tesla sales and setbacks at his aerospace company Space X—not to mention Trump’s withdrawal of Musk ally Jared Isaacman’s nomination to head NASA, as well as leaked allegations about Musk’s drug use. “DOGE is gonna continue, just as a way of life,” he told CBS. “I will have some participation in that, but as I’ve said publicly, my focus has to be on the companies at this point.” Polling suggests that, for most Americans, that’s music to their ears.",2025-06-01 21:09:07+00:00,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/elon-musk-sure-seems-happy-to-be-fleeing-dc/,

Reconciliation at Risk: 50 Years After the Vietnam War

April 30 marked 50 years since the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam war. Vietnam’s closest partners, including China, Cambodia, and Laos, sent representatives to the commemorations held in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. Notably missing from the main parade were representatives from the United States, who were reportedly instructed by Washington not to attend.

The United States’ absence from the events, in addition to recent cuts to programs related to war legacy issues, muddles its relationship with Vietnam. To maintain momentum in the deepening relationship with Vietnam, the United States must prioritize war reconciliation efforts, one of the key pillars of the U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership. War reconciliation has been instrumental in improving the United States’ relationship with Vietnam over the last three decades.

U.S.-Vietnam relations have flourished in recent years. In 2023, the United States and Vietnam elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest level in Vietnam’s diplomatic repertoire. The partnership is a significant upgrade from U.S.-Vietnam relations just a decade ago, when Washington hosted the first ever visit by a Vietnamese Communist Party general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong. This year also marks 30 years since the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations, which Vietnamese deputy prime minister and foreign minister Bui Thanh Son and U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio celebrated via phone call less than a week after President Donald Trump reentered office.

U.S.-Vietnam relations in recent months, however, have been inconsistent. On April 2, Trump placed “reciprocal tariffs” on over 180 countries, assigning a massive 46 percent tariff to goods from Vietnam. Instead of retaliating, General Secretary To Lam approached Trump directly. In what Trump described as a “very productive” phone call, Lam offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero, and Trump accepted an invitation for a working visit to Vietnam. Just one week later, Trump placed a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs, leaving in place a 10 percent tariff on most countries including Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam then held a second round of tariff negotiations from May 19 to 22, led by U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Hong Dien. The negotiations were reportedly positive, and talks will resume in early June.

But later in April, the Trump administration reportedly instructed its senior diplomats in Vietnam not to attend any celebrations tied to the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. This included Ambassador Marc Knapper, the son of a Vietnam war veteran, who had intended to attend anniversary events on April 29 and 30. Knapper’s absence at Vietnam’s anniversary parade was a missed opportunity for the United States to reaffirm its commitment toward war reconciliation efforts. His attendance would have sent a powerful signal. In a partial reversal, the Trump administration at the last minute sent Susan Burns, the U.S. consul general in Ho Chi Minh City, to attend an anniversary reception on April 29, but still allowed no representatives to the main parade.

In recent months, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the attempted closure of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) have disrupted programs dedicated to addressing legacies of war in Vietnam. When the administration on January 24 halted all USAID contracts, workers were in the process of decontaminating the Bien Hoa Airbase of dioxin, a lethal byproduct of Agent Orange. Due to the short notice, pits of contaminated soil were left exposed, initially covered by flimsy tarps that blew away in the wind. U.S. diplomats urged the administration to address the exposed soil due to safety concerns. With Vietnam approaching its rainy season, the tainted soil could have flooded into nearby cities, poisoning food and water supplies. The Trump administration did not respond to these concerns until early March, when it allowed work at Bien Hoa to resume. But the companies in charge of the project, Tetra Tech and Vietnamese construction firm VINA E&C, are reportedly still not receiving promised funds. As a result, the companies have rushed to secure the exposed Bien Hoa site before the rainy season hits at their own expense.

Meanwhile, the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s most visited museum, was meant to unveil a USAID and USIP-backed exhibit highlighting the United States’ reconciliation efforts and positive instances of U.S.-Vietnam cooperation. This exhibit would have marked the first time the U.S. government had direct involvement in how the war is portrayed in Vietnam. The significance of an exhibit showing the United States’ reconciliation efforts in a museum full of “American war crimes” could begin to shift decades of stigmatization and resentment in Vietnam and further promote mutual understanding. Funds for the project remain frozen, and the USAID and USIP officials in charge of the project are no longer allowed to work, leaving it in indefinite hiatus.

Addressing war legacies is critical to maintaining the U.S.-Vietnam relationship. A relationship that began with resentment and hostility has transformed into a mutually beneficial partnership core to U.S. interests. Over the last 50 years, the United States and Vietnam went from enemies to security partners. Vietnam has also played a key role in U.S. friendshoring efforts, receiving $2 million in seed funding via the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act for its semiconductor industry. With all the progress made in recent years, the U.S.-Vietnam relationship still has opportunities for growth. If prioritized, the strength of U.S.-Vietnam relations could be more strategic now than ever.

I was in 8th grade when I saw images on black & white TV showing Americans fleeing Vietnam in 1975, as NVA troops approached Saigon. I saw U.S. troops shove their own helicopters off of ships so they wouldn't fall into North Vietnamese hands. I saw desperate, screaming Vietnamese refugees trying to storm into the U.S. embassy, seeking asylum before Saigon fell to the NVA. I never forgot those TV images. They looked ugly and scary, both for our troops and for the Vietnamese.

Younger Vietnamese are easily the most pro American Asians in that region. Every one I have had the pleasure to meet has been very positive about Americans and being allies and more importantly business partners. My X of a 4 year relationship Twi was born in Da Nang, we meet in University in NYC. We went to visit family a number of times I LOVE Vietnam it’s a spectacular beautiful country. The food is epic win, and they have world class waves for a surfer like me. Plus fishing of all styles, fly, deep sea , bow and spear in fresh and salt waters. Da Nang is a modern city of 1+ million with brand new sky scrapper condos everywhere everywhere it’s on my short list for expat locations once I can convince my wife to sell her two brick and mortar businesses. You can have a 4 bedroom condo in a tower for the equivalent of $600 a month with staff included. The USD is worth 26,000 Dong offshore money is not taxed and it has huge purchasing power in Vietnam. GenX has no beef with Vietnam or the Vietnamese people we simply don’t care that boomers do. Vietnam is very pro business they have favorable taxes for investment and readily give visas for investors. They are CINOs commies in name only. They recognize that capitalism brings wealth and keep the single party system only in name, ordinary people readily own, operate small and large businesses in Vietnam. Investors with a local partner can also run a successful business it’s a market eeconomy more open than the USA it has a lot less regulations and taxes and permits and licences and..and. It’s a myth the USA is a free business economy we are not. Go to Hong Kong, Singapore or Vietnam the differences will make you cringe at the system we have to deal with here. If you have to ask daddy government, daddy can I please have a permit, then a licence, then pay fees to keep that privilege to run your own personal business guess what that’s not freedom.

Adriana Smith sentia fortes dores de cabeça quando decidiu procurar um hospital na Geórgia, nos Estados Unidos, há três meses. Grávida de nove semanas, ela foi medicada e, sem ser submetida a nenhum exame, teve alta. Na manhã seguinte, foi encaminhada à emergência com a respiração ofegante. Dessa vez, o diagnóstico veio: coágulos sanguíneos no cérebro.

Aos 30 anos, Smith teve a morte cerebral decretada pouco após sua internação, mas, mesmo sem autorização da família, seu corpo foi mantido em suporte de vida para permitir o desenvolvimento do feto. O caso chamou a atenção em todo o país e reacendeu o debate sobre os limites éticos e legais das políticas antiaborto promovidas por governos estaduais comandados por republicanos, em meio ao corte de gastos e medidas controvérsias da administração de Donald Trump contra organizações voltadas para a saúde feminina.

Familiares de Smith, incluindo seu filho de 5 anos, ainda a visitam no hospital. Segundo eles, os médicos informaram que não estão autorizados a desligar os dispositivos que a mantém respirando porque a lei estadual proíbe o aborto após a detecção da atividade cardíaca do feto, o que geralmente ocorre por volta da sexta semana de gravidez. A lei foi aprovada em 2019, mas só passou a ser aplicada em 2022, depois da revogação do histórico caso Roe v. Wade, que garantia o direito federal ao aborto nos Estados Unidos. Os legisladores, no entanto, não parecem ter considerado uma situação em que uma mulher grávida esteja legalmente morta, escreveu a especialista em direito reprodutivo Kimberly Mutcherson para o New York Times.

“[É] uma espécie de experimento: permitir que um feto se desenvolva no corpo de uma mulher com morte cerebral. Sabendo do enorme esforço que o corpo de uma gestante precisa fazer para sustentar e nutrir uma gravidez, não é possível saber com certeza os danos que um feto pode sofrer ao permanecer preso em um corpo sem um cérebro funcional”, acrescentou. A preocupação também é citada pela mãe de Smith, Newkirk. Ela disse ter sido informada de que o feto de sua filha apresenta acúmulo de líquido no cérebro, o que faz com que seu neto possa nascer “cego, sem conseguir andar” ou mesmo sem forças para sobreviver.

“Até onde se sabe, é a família [de Smith] quem está pagando por isso, porque nós não temos nenhum sistema que diga que o hospital deve cobrir os custos de manter o corpo dela funcionando”, disse ao GLOBO a democrata Jasmine Clark, deputada estadual da Geórgia. “Isso me preocupa muito porque reforça a ideia de que o governo não vê as mulheres como seres humanos de verdade, especialmente as mulheres grávidas. Parece que, a partir do momento em que você engravida, perde o direito de ser humano e passa a ser apenas uma incubadora. Acho uma forma horrível de enxergar mais da metade da população”.

O assunto é especialmente importante porque os EUA apresentam a maior taxa de mortalidade materna entre todos os países ricos. Os dados mais recentes, de 2023, mostram que o país teve 18,6 mortes para cada 100 mil nascimentos. O número representa uma queda em relação a 2022, quando 22,3 mulheres morreram a cada 100 mil partos, mas o detalhamento dos dados revela uma realidade preocupante: embora os óbitos tenham diminuído, as mortes de mulheres negras aumentaram, saindo de 49,5 em 2022 para 50,3 por 100 mil nascidos em 2023. O grupo foi o único que apresentou um aumento de ocorrências no país, com mais que o triplo do que taxas para mulheres brancas (14,5), hispânicas (12,4) e asiáticas (10,7).

A maior parte dessas mortes (80%) é evitável, segundo dados do Centro de Controle e Prevenção de Doenças (CDC). Especialistas atribuem a taxa excepcional ao fato de que o país não oferece saúde pública universal, nem licença maternidade remunerada, ao contrário de todos os seus pares. Na Noruega, por exemplo — onde nenhuma morte materna foi registrada em 2022 —, são oferecidas 86 semanas de afastamento.

“Nos Estados Unidos, tudo é baseado em seguros de saúde, geralmente vinculados ao emprego. É muito caro conseguir um seguro se você está desempregado”, disse Clark. “Quando uma pessoa engravida, o governo fornece um seguro temporário. Mas isso significa que há muitas mulheres que só começam a ir regularmente ao médico nesse período. Em muitos casos, elas já estavam com a saúde debilitada e não sabiam”.

Novas estratégias

Clark fez parte de uma delegação de parlamentares americanas que veio ao Brasil no último mês em viagem promovida pela Women’s Equality Center e o State Innovation Exchange. O grupo buscou entender as consequências sociais e de longo prazo da criminalização do aborto, traçando paralelos entre os dois países. A agenda ocorreu enquanto a oposição estadual democrata busca se reorganizar para responder aos efeitos do novo governo Trump e preservar os direitos reprodutivos — ao mesmo tempo em que veem a preeminência do tema praticamente desaparecer do cenário político dos EUA.

Diante dos cortes de gastos que desmantelam agências federais, as demissões em massa, os anúncios de tarifas e as políticas de cerco às universidades e aos imigrantes, os democratas hoje têm direcionado seu foco político para outras questões. Embora a maior parte da oposição ainda veja o direito ao aborto como um pilar do partido, ela também considera essencial expandir o discurso para além da pauta, acreditando que o novo governo republicano abriu espaço para outras prioridades. Trump, que no passado já se gabou por seu papel na derrubada do caso Roe v. Wade — ele indicou três juízes que garantiram a decisão —, mal mencionou o tema desde que assumiu seu segundo mandato.

“No Tennessee, por exemplo, temos uma das proibições mais rígidas ao aborto. Sem exceção para estupro, incesto ou para meninas pequenas. É também um dos estados com maior taxa de mortalidade infantil (6,6 a cada 100 mil) e materna (41,1, a maior do país). Ao mesmo tempo, os republicanos têm controle absoluto”, disse a senadora London Lamar ao GLOBO. “Então, ao invés de lutar uma batalha perdida, mudei minha estratégia para levantar a bandeira da saúde materna”.

Investimentos sob ameaça

Mesmo nesse cenário, em abril o Departamento de Saúde e Serviços Humanos (HHS, na sigla em inglês) anunciou que encerraria o financiamento da histórica Iniciativa de Saúde da Mulher (WHI) a partir de setembro. A decisão, que posteriormente foi revertida após a má repercussão, colocava em risco o futuro de um dos maiores estudos sobre saúde feminina no mundo. A iniciativa acompanha a saúde de milhares de mulheres para entender como reduzir os riscos de câncer, doenças cardiovasculares e outras condições pós-menopausa.

Todo o financiamento do projeto soma apenas cerca de US$ 10 milhões por ano — menos da metade do que os contribuintes americanos supostamente gastaram com as viagens de golfe de Trump nos três primeiros meses de seu mandato, segundo a NBC. Dias depois do anúncio do corte, o secretário do HHS, Robert Kennedy Jr., voltou atrás e disse reconhecer que a iniciativa é “essencial para a saúde das mulheres”.

Ainda assim, os efeitos do novo governo serão sentidos por milhares de pessoas no mundo. O movimento de corte de gastos da administração que levou ao cancelamento de mais de 80% dos programas de ajuda externa da Usaid, a principal agência de ajuda do país, deverá impedir que quase 50 milhões de mulheres tenham acesso a métodos contraceptivos —o que, por sua vez, poderá contribuir para o aumento da mortalidade materna global. Ao anunciar a medida, em março, o governo afirmou que os contratos anulados “gastaram dezenas de dólares de maneiras que não serviam” aos interesses dos EUA, embora o valor destinado à agência fosse menos de 1% do orçamento federal anual.

“Há décadas, os Estados Unidos implementaram, como resultado do movimento pelos direitos civis e das lutas e protestos contínuos, ações afirmativas, esforços de diversidade, equidade e inclusão, para garantir algum nível de oportunidade e justiça”, disse Lamar. “Agora não é mais assim. É como se estivéssemos voltando no tempo”.",2025-06-01 21:00:00+00:00,https://www.infomoney.com.br/saude/eua-gravida-mantida-viva-por-lei-antiaborto-gera-debate-sobre-limites-eticos/,

El magnate ha estado cuatro meses al frente del Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental (DOGE), y aunque no haya logrado todos sus objetivos, los estragos de la oficina son todavía incalculables. “La misión DOGE solo se fortalecerá con el tiempo, a medida que se convierta en una forma de vida en todo el Gobierno”, escribió el propio Musk en su anuncio de despedida. Tanto él como Trump y sus adeptos han insistido en la idea de que si se va es porque ha agotado el periodo máximo que puede desempeñarse como empleado especial del Gobierno y, si bien es cierto, no deja de ser parte de un relato interesado. ¿Acaso alguien duda de que, si Elon Musk quisiera seguir, fuera donde fuera, Donald Trump no le buscaría el hueco? El hombre más rico del mundo fue el mayor donante individual en la historia de Estados Unidos y, con las elecciones intermedias a la vista, Trump precisa que siga tirando de billetera. No, Elon Musk se va porque se ha dado cuenta de que presidente solo hay uno, sea su amigo o no, y de que, si continúa desatendiendo a sus empresas, sobre todo Space X y Tesla, quizás lo que se vea recortada sea su inmensa fortuna.

Más allá de las excusas que Musk pueda poner, como su oposición a la Big Beautiful Bill [sic] de Donald Trump, el magnate lleva ya un tiempo deslizando la idea de abandonar la primera línea política. Durante estos meses, la atención sobre su figura aumentaba al mismo ritmo que caían los beneficios de Tesla. De igual modo, la confianza de sus inversores descendía de forma proporcional a los despidos masivos de empleados gubernamentales y la abolición de oficinas impulsados por DOGE. A principios de mayo, de hecho, la junta directiva de Tesla advirtió a Elon Musk de que debería pasar más tiempo en la empresa. Según publicó el Wall Street Journal, incluso iniciaron la búsqueda de un nuevo CEO para la compañía. En diferentes ocasiones, también estos últimos días, el propio Musk se mostraba disgustado por el hecho de que algunas personas decidieran incluso quemar sus vehículos. Y no solo en Estados Unidos, también en Europa, debido a la injerencia del magnate en la política británica o alemana, donde apoyó sin fisuras a la extrema derecha.

Las cosas tampoco le iban (ni van) bien con Space X. Los cohetes Starship, la gran apuesta aeroespacial de Musk, explotaron en los lanzamientos de enero y marzo y terminaron con sus restos en el océano. Hace unos días, ya con la mente alejada del Gobierno, Space X realizó otro lanzamiento. Esta vez, aunque la nave sí consiguió llegar al espacio, no pudo regresar. El cohete sufrió una fuga, empezó a girar sin control y... Se desintegró. Por suerte, todavía son pruebas no tripuladas.

El tercer eje de su conglomerado empresarial, xAI, su empresa de inteligencia artificial, también atraviesa dificultades, más cuando el desarrollo de la competencia no deja de crecer. Recientemente, Musk trató por todos los medios de frenar un acuerdo entre la organización OpenAI (ChatGPT), de Sam Altman, y los Emiratos Árabes Unidos para construir en Abu Dabi uno de los centros de datos de IA más grandes del mundo. Musk llegó a decir que Trump no permitiría dicho acuerdo si no se incluía en el contrato a su propia empresa, xAI. Según contó The New York Times, “Musk se quejó a David Sacks, asesor del presidente en materia de IA, [...] e intentó que su propia empresa se incluyera en el acuerdo, aunque finalmente no fue así”. Para fastidio del magnate, “el acuerdo con OpenAI siguió un plan establecido entre el Gobierno de Trump y los Emiratos Árabes Unidos”.

Musk se va, pero su influencia y su legado, uno de apenas cuatro meses, no. Aunque deje su papel al frente de DOGE, las consecuencias de sus recortes son ingentes. El magnate no solo ha dejado a miles de empleados sin trabajo, sino que muchos de sus recortes pueden incluso terminar aumentando el déficit estadounidense, cuando justamente se opone al presupuesto que acaba de aprobar Trump porque también aumentará la deuda del país. Pero ya no solo es Estados Unidos. Musk fue quien desde el principio abogó por cargarse la agencia de ayuda al desarrollo, USAID, cuya eliminación promete la pobreza, incluso la muerte, a millones de personas.

Además, aunque haya contratos que haya perdido, como el mencionado en Abu Dabi, Musk se ha servido de su papel privilegiado en la Administración de Trump para hacerse con información sensible no solo de millones de ciudadanos de Estados Unidos, sino también y sobre todo de empresas que compiten con las suyas. Por otro lado, DOGE, por ahora, no ha desaparecido. Los acólitos de Musk continúan ocupando las principales agencias gubernamentales estadounidenses. Uno de ellos, y quizás el más importante, es un joven de 19 años apodado Big Balls, quien, según una reciente investigación de Reuters, prestó ayuda a un grupo de ciberdelincuencia “que ejercía acoso cibernético contra una gente del FBI y traficaba datos robados”.

Esta semana, Trump y Musk escenificaron una suerte de despedida para acallar los rumores que dicen que ya no son tan amigos. Y ambos insistieron en que estos primeros cuatro meses de DOGE son solo el comienzo. Musk ha implantado un sistema disparatado de recortes que todavía no conoce fin. “El equipo de DOGE se fortalecerá con el tiempo. Su influencia seguirá creciendo. Es como una especie de budismo. Es como una forma de vida”, dijo Musk. Trump, por su parte, eliminó las dudas con relación al nuevo papel del hombre más rico del mundo. “Elon realmente no se va. Va a estar yendo y viniendo”, aseguró. Puede que su objetivo, de nuevo, sea el de conquistar Marte, pero desde luego Musk no va a dejar de atender lo que suceda en el Gobierno estadounidense. Su fortuna depende de ello.",2025-06-01 18:59:37+00:00,https://www.huffingtonpost.es/global/elon-musk-consecuencias-corto-legado-sonun-incalculables.html,

Bono took a swing at the Trump administration disbanding the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, blaming the cuts for a staggering 300,000 deaths.

The Irish Bono points a finger of shame at the USA for throwing away less of its money:

“What is that? That’s not America, is it?”

Rogan set him straight regarding the corrupt not to mention ideologically deranged institution:

“For sure, it was a money laundering operation. For sure, there was no oversight.”

Bono did not pull the body count out from his rear end but from a comparably unsavory place:

Bono’s 300,000 figure comes not from confirmed deaths, but from a speculative model built by Brooke Nichols, a mathematical health modeler at Boston University, projecting what could happen as a result of the cuts.

According to liberal Experts and their speculative models, Florida is already underwater because of the fictional global warming crisis.

“A lie repeated enough times becomes the truth,” propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels is said to have said. But this no longer holds true, now that the liberal establishment has lost its monopoly on the distribution of information. Thanks to Musk having bought Twitter and transforming it into X and to shows like Rogan’s, the sort of lies Bono likes to tell get debunked.

¡Qué lástima, pero adiós! Me despido de ti y me voy. La frase no es de Elon Musk, está extraída de una conocida canción de la mexicana Julieta Venegas, pero define a la perfección el punto y final a la relación que mantenían el magnate y empresario multimillonario y el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump. Desde el principio, el suyo no pareció que fuera a ser un matrimonio bien avenido. Aunque en 2016, parecían prometérselas muy felices. El republicano lo incluyó como «asesor empresarial» durante su primer mandato, en un equipo en el que estaban presentes también altos ejecutivos de gigantes como Pepsi o Uber y que se presentó en la Torre Trump a bombo y platillo con asistentes de la talla de Tim Cook o Jeff Bezos, directores ejecutivos de Apple y Amazon. Pero en 2017, llegó la primera ruptura. El presidente negacionista del cambio climático retiró al país del acuerdo de París. «No parece tener el tipo de carácter que refleje bien al país», dijo Musk antes de abandonar el consejo consultivo: «El cambio climático es real. Abandonar París no es bueno para Estados Unidos ni para el mundo».

Con el paso del tiempo, y aunque el fundador de Tesla se definía hace una década como «progresista en lo social y conservador en lo fiscal», retomó lo halagos hacia Donald Trump, maximizados en la última campaña electoral estadounidense, en la que inyectó más de 250 millones de dólares al plan «MAGA» (Make America Great Again), el del «único candidato que preservará la democracia en EE.UU.».

Musk al frente de DOGE, las tijeras de Trump

La inyección económica del también dueño de la red social X no cayó en saco roto. Tuvo su lugar privilegiado el pasado enero en la investidura. «Gracias a ustedes el futuro de la civilización está asegurado», dijo a sus 53 años acompañando sus palabras de un gesto tremendamente parecido al saludo nazi. Lo siguiente que hizo el nuevo presidente fue ponerle un despacho. No uno cualquiera. Uno que sirviese para dirigir la gran herramienta gubernamental creada para hacer que la Administración del país ahorrase como nunca antes. La tijera del Departamento de Eficiencia Gubernamental (DOGE) prometió un recorte de 2 billones de dólares. El «empleado especial del gobierno», como lo definió Trump, se ponía manos a la obra porque «el futuro será fantástico a partir de ahora».

En una entrevista conjunta ofrecida a la Fox, altavoz republicano por excelencia, intercambiaron halagos. «Quería a alguien realmente inteligente para trabajar conmigo», fue claro el mandatario dirigiendo una mirada de aprobación hacia Musk, que tampoco se quedó corto de alabanzas: «Yo quiero al presidente. Solo quiero dejar eso claro. Creo que el presidente Trump es un buen hombre». «Pueden llamarlo empleado, asesor, lo que quieran, pero para mí, Elon es un patriota», cerraba el círculo de zalamerías el actual ocupante del Despacho Oval.

La cantante Sheryl Crow vende su Tesla y las protestas llegan a los concesionarios: la ideología de Musk hunde los «swasticars» IAGO GARCÍA

Lejos de los objetivos marcados

Miles de empleados en el sector público fueron a la calle. Se perdieron un total de 260.000 puestos de trabajadores federales, desmantelando oficinas tan sensibles como USAid, hasta entonces líder mundial en ayuda humanitaria o 18F, referente en lo relativo a la mejora de servicios digitales. El desencanto y las protestas entre el funcionariado llegaron a afectar a su marca de coches Tesla, que atraviesa una grave crisis de ventas. En Europa, vende la mitad; y en todo el mundo, sus beneficios cayeron un 70 %. Hasta Donald Trump le compró un vehículo, porque «este hombre ha dedicado su energía y su vida a hacer esto». «Creo que lo han tratado mal un pequeño grupo de personas», posaban los dos ante un flamante Model S, el buque insignia de la firma, el pasado marzo. Por aquel entonces, todo parecía ir sobre ruedas en la pareja: «No hay un mejor equipo. No hay nadie mejor para lo que estamos haciendo».

Sin embargo, el departamento DOGE no ha cumplido las expectativas. Hoy, más de cuatro meses después de su puesta en marcha, el ahorro no llega ni al 9 % de lo prometido, menos de 200.000 millones que han tenido además un coste político elevado. Trump ha perdido votos entre los empleados públicos, mientras que la imagen del magnate, convertido en un experto en aplicar el bisturí con el único objetivo de hacer caja, penaliza sus negocios.

Con los aranceles empezó la ruptura

El principal enemigo de Elon Musk estaba muy cerca. Otro experto en hacer números, pero que no tiene necesidad, como el empresario, de vender mucho en muchos sitios diferentes. Se trata de Peter Navarro, economista de cabecera de Trump, firme defensor de políticas proteccionistas, que considera a China una amenaza existencial para su país y que no quiere saber nada del mercado global y el libre comercio. En el primer mandato del republicano fue consejero principal de Comercio y Fabricación. Y desde enero, a sus 75 años, ostenta un cargo similar liderando la polémica política de aranceles del país en los últimos tiempos. Una alteración de los flujos comerciales y las balanzas de importaciones y exportaciones que no solo afectan a Estados Unidos, sino a antaño aliados como la Unión Europea o Canadá. Los socios son ahora enemigos y los mercados internacionales caen inmersos en un período de incertidumbre que no se sabe hasta dónde llegará.

Peter Navarro, el verdadero artífice de los aranceles de Trump, y sus desencuentros con el «ensamblador de coches» Elon Musk IAGO GARCÍA

«Navarro es un auténtico imbécil», dijo quien monta componentes, en buena parte procedentes de China, en los vehículos eléctricos que produce. Al tiempo, el economista, usaba a Musk, como el ejemplo perfecto de «quien desea componentes [mecánicos] extranjeros baratos para sus coches». Navarro quiere que revitalizar la industria obligando a que las fábricas se instalen localmente como estrategia principal de revitalización económica. «Lo que dice es manifiestamente falso. Tesla es el fabricante de automóviles más verticalmente integrado de Estados Unidos, con el mayor porcentaje de contenido estadounidense. Navarro es más tonto que un saco de ladrillos», llegaba la réplica de Elon, evidenciando el primer gran distanciamiento con el ejecutivo republicano.

La política presupuestaria, la gota que colmó a Musk

Dice el refrán que del amor al odio hay un paso. En este caso, lo que va a provocar el divorcio definitivo es el proyecto presupuestario y fiscal del gobierno norteamericano. Aunque en los papeles presentados por los republicanos en la Cámara de Representantes y aprobados por tan solo un voto de diferencia (215 a 214), se observa una fuerte rebaja de impuestos a los ciudadanos, la ley fiscal no va acompañada de recortes en sanidad o a otras ayudas ciudadanas. Por lo que la norma que Trump adjetiva como la «más importante que se vaya a firmar en la historia de nuestro país», es para los inversores y agencias de calificación una herramienta que no hará más que aumentar la deuda y los problemas de EE.UU. para financiarse.

Entre los díscolos, el hombre más rico del mundo, que suma a los negocios ya mencionados, los satélites Starlink o la agencia espacial SpaceX. «Francamente, me decepcionó ver el enorme proyecto de ley de gastos, que aumenta el déficit presupuestario y socava el trabajo que está realizando el equipo de DOGE», definió Musk en la CBS la «gran y hermosa ley» defendida con ese nombre por los republicanos y que debe ahora recibir el visto bueno del Senado. Pero el multimillonario, ya no estará en el ejecutivo en ese momento.

""It's a tragedy. And what we need right now is an immediate ceasefire, complete, unfettered access, along with the safe fence roads, every gate open, to feed people and stop this catastrophe from happening. If we don't do that, it's going to be a humanitarian catastrophe, as I've said, like none other,"" McCain said Sunday on ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos.""

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began delivering aid this week after an 11-week embargo. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on May 19 that Israel, ""with our American friends,"" was creating a ""system with distribution centers"" that would be ""secured by the IDF, preventing Hamas from reaching the area.""

GHF has been criticized by the United Nations and other aid groups for its distribution methods. Photos and videos out of Gaza show long lines of Palestinians waiting for aid. The United Nations warns that Gaza is approaching a famine.

World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain appears on ABC News' ""This Week"" on June 1, 2025 ABC News

According to the Gaza health ministry, 31 people were killed and 200 injured when Israel opened fire on a GHF aid distribution center located in Rafah. In a statement posted to X, the Israel Defense Forces said, ""At this stage, there are no known casualties from IDF gunfire"" within the site. ""The matter is still under investigation.""

""They don't have nearly enough access points. They don't have nearly enough food going in. And -- and so the -- the feel of desperation, you can see it in the video, is very -- it's very disheartening,"" McCain said. ""I mean, for all of us that do this, you know, this is what we do. We -- we -- we understand what it takes and we understand the complexity of it. But we also understand the grave humanitarian need that -- that is existing now.""

Here are more highlights from McCain's interview:

On the UN's interaction with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation

Stephanopoulos: Have you had any coordination at all this week with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation?

McCain: No, I have not personally. I know that there's been some -- some meetings that have taken place around the -- around the -- Europe, particularly on some of the things. But we have -- we've not seen a plan. We've been a part of some of those meetings. Some of them we have not been. But again, we've seen no plan. And, look, we will work with anybody to feed. This is -- this is the kind of thing that, at this level of desperation, we've got to work together on trying to feed people. So -- so it's not about not willing to work with people. We need the access. We need the Israelis to let us in so we can do our job. And we do it -- we are the best at what we do, I might add. And we're the ones -- we -- we can -- we can not only get in, but we can get in at scale, which is what is most important right now.

On Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying 'that’s a lie that people are dying from USAID cuts

Stephanopoulos: Is it a lie that people have died because of the aid cuts?

McCain: Well, you know, I'm not going to -- going to even pretend to understand what's going on with inside the -- the U.S. government at this particular point.

Joe Rogan, Musk Slam ‘Liar’ and ‘Idiot’ Bono over His Claim USAID Cuts Caused 300,000 Deaths

U2 frontman Bono claimed on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast the Trump administration’s disbandment of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was responsible for some 300,000 associated deaths.

Host Rogan and Elon Musk were quick to disabuse the Irish singer of his mass-casualty claim.

“This will f— you off,” Bono warned, claiming tens of thousands of tons of food are “rotting” in warehouses from Djibouti to Houston because of recent USAID cuts and those running the warehouses have been let go, as FOX News writer Jasmine Baehr reported.

“What is that? That’s not America, is it?”

Rogan responded.

“They’re throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” he said while adding there were aid groups that delivered good work the USAID system has been riddled with corruption and needed to go.

“For sure, it was a money laundering operation. For sure, there was no oversight. … Trillions that are unaccounted for.”

If this were true, Bono is essentially arguing that the US needs to spend $100 million dollars per life saved. That’s a lot of lives lost in America to create that amount of wealth to spend in the third world.

So we send fresh fruits, meats, and vegetables by container ship across thousands of miles to rot before it's distributed. Even USAID wouldn't be dumb enough to send perishables for aid distribution.

The media fawn over this guy (Bono) as if he is some kind of God/Hero and expert when it comes to his favorite lefty causes - demanding the US pay the way for 3rd world countries and “open its wallet.” He usually only talks to lefty media outlets that share his lefty vision lest he be questioned on his expertise, experience and knowledge of the causes he promotes - and thinks we Americans should unquestioningly fund. Good for Joe Rogan. Hope Bono f’s-off (the “f” word being one of Bono’s favorite words) back to Ireland and shuts up.

""Our members are surviving with grace,"" says Justine Adhiambo Obura, the chairperson of No Sex for Fish.

She's talking about a cooperative of 20 women who did the unthinkable. They are fishmongers from the village of Nduru Beach in Kenya who said no to fishermen who demanded: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

With the support of various charities and programs, these women eventually got their own boats — and hired men to fish for them in Lake Victoria. The name of their group is a testament to their success.

But in the year 2025, their survival is precarious. The No Sex for Fish women are coping with the legacy of disastrous floods that have virtually destroyed their village and disrupted the fishing business. And now they're facing new fears about their health.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Eleven of these women are HIV positive. Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S.

But in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted.

A single mom's story

Rebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place.

Their former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees.

While scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

She says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be ""the displacement from my home"" because of the flooding — and earning a living.

Sponsor Message

Now she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy?

""They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,"" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother.

""We are scared of what the future holds,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

So what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid.

But according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them.

It's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity ""to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.""

The source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and ""took a while to restart.""

What's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback.

""The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,"" the source says.

Sponsor Message

The government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit.

So even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs.

""People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,"" the former PEPFAR employee said. ""But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.""

""There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,"" says Oluoch. ""They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.""

In response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that ""PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries.

""All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.""

Erick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government.

""I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,"" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024.

Haunted by a member's death

The women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills.

Rose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Her husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS.

Jack is HIV positive as well. ""I have also been taking my drugs from health center,"" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad.

""I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,"" he says.

Naomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Like most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods.

Sponsor Message

Adding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, ""My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,"" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills.

""It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,"" she says.

Akoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive.

It is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Theresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. ""The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,"" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties.

And it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. ""Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,"" she says. ""The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.""

Cash aid from table banking

Justine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other.

""We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

""Table banking"" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs.

They meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

Alice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need.

But she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. ""The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,"" says Amonde.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

In spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors.

Yet it can be hard to hold on to hope.

""We are living a daily nightmare,"" says Rebbeccah Atieno. ""Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.""

Reacting on X to a clip of the conversation, Elon Musk slammed Bono directly.

“He’s such a liar/idiot,” Musk wrote after others had already called Bono to account for his wild, untested assertion.

FOX News made clear in its report Bono’s 300,000 figure comes not from confirmed deaths, but from a speculative model built by Brooke Nichols, a mathematical health modeler at Boston University, projecting what could happen as a result of the cuts.

Nichols has said the number is a projection, not a direct count, due to the absence of real-time tracking in many affected regions.

“The biggest uncertainties in all of these estimates are: 1) the extent to which countries and organizations have pivoted to mitigate this disaster (likely highly variable),” she wrote in the Washington Post. “And 2) which programs are actually still funded with funding actually flowing — and which aren’t.”",2025-06-01 12:27:53+00:00,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/06/01/joe-rogan-musk-slam-liar-and-idiot-bono-over-his-claim-usaid-cuts-caused-300000-deaths/,

He’s gonna be back and forth.” It’s tempting to treat that statement, which was made by President Donald Trump at a press conference intended to mark Elon Musk’s departure from government, as news. It certainly flies in the face of several news reports about the tech billionaire stepping away from the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency”—his pet cost-cutting and people-killing project—as some kind of retreat. Musk had, after all, come to Washington, D.C., on a mission to remake the federal government in his own image.

So, after slashing the foreign aid that helps ensure that children around the world aren’t born with HIV and firing thousands of federal workers—and destroying his own public image, likely permanently—Musk had come to the end of the road. He could only do so much, after all. His companies needed him, don’t you know. And so, he decided to pack his bags (which were apparently full of drugs) and return to doing whatever it was he did before he spent his days hopping around like an idiot and posting online about “white genocide.” (Those same drugs, I’m guessing.)

It’s convenient framing for everyone. For the press, it tells a story about Musk, who did a lot of consequential things but ultimately failed to come remotely close to his stated goal of cutting $1 trillion from the budget by August. (The actual number is debatable, but it’s unquestionably much, much lower.) For Republicans, it’s an opportunity for a victory lap, celebrating Musk as a visionary who really did change the shape of the government (in that he helped destroy it; Russell Vought will now likely take the baton), while quietly ridding themselves of an albatross. For Democrats, it’s an opportunity to claim a scalp and draw attention to a fissure in Trump’s coalition. There’s only one tiny problem with the emerging narrative: It’s bunk. Elon’s really not leaving. Trump himself said so.

It isn’t just Trump, though. Vice President JD Vance has said more or less the same thing. So has Musk. The real reason that he’s “leaving” (or “quiet quitting”) is that he has spent the last four months as a “special government employee,” a distinction with a 130-day time limit. Were he to continue working in the same capacity, he would be required by federal law to fill out certain financial and ethical disclosures that he is currently exempted from as an SGE. Given his vast fortune (and lack of ethics), Musk does not want to do this and therefore has no choice but to “step back.” It’s undoubtedly true that he has taken more of a backseat in recent weeks, particularly as his popularity has plummeted, but there’s no reason to believe that he’s cutting all ties with Trump. DOGE, meanwhile, is very much still ticking. Musk is, as Trump said, just “gonna be back and forth.”",2025-06-01 10:00:00+00:00,https://newrepublic.com/article/195945/elon-musk-trump-doge-corruption,

Rogan azonban rögtön közbeszólt, és azt mondta, hogy bár vannak valóban hasznos segélyprogramok, a USAID működését szerinte éveken át az átláthatatlanság, pazarlás és korrupció jellemezte. A beszélgetés egy részletét a közösségi médiában is terjesztették, ahol Elon Musk egyetlen mondattal kommentálta Bono kijelentését: „Hazudik vagy ostoba.”

Nem valós a 300 ezres adat

Mint később kiderült, Bono állításának alapja nem hivatalos statisztika volt, hanem egy matematikai előrejelzés. A becslést Brooke Nichols, a Bostoni Egyetem modellezési szakértője készítette, aki maga is hangsúlyozta, hogy a 300 ezer fős szám nem tény, hanem egy lehetséges forgatókönyv, amely számos bizonytalanságot tartalmaz. Nichols szerint az egyik fő kérdés, hogy a helyi országok és szervezetek mennyire tudták pótolni az elmaradt amerikai támogatásokat, illetve hogy mely programokat állították le ténylegesen.

Elon Musk a USAID nagy kritikusa

Elon Musk – aki a Trump-adminisztráció alatt a kormányzati hatékonyság javítását célzó reformok egyik szószólója volt – régóta bírálja a nemzetközi segélyezési rendszert. Az USAID alá tartozó szerződések kilencven százalékát leépítették az elmúlt években, Musk pedig ennek szükségességét az „elszámolás és átláthatóság” hiányával indokolta. A vita kapcsán több ismert kommentátor és közösségi médiaszereplő is megszólalt. Volt, aki úgy fogalmazott:

Egyetértek Elonnal: Bono hazug és idióta.

Mások emlékeztettek rá, hogy maga Bono is elismerte, hogy a szám „nem bizonyított.” A történet újra reflektorfénybe állította az USA nemzetközi segélypolitikáját. A kritikusok szerint a rendszer gyakran szolgált politikai és pénzügyi érdekcsoportokat a valódi humanitárius célok helyett.

Elon Musk'ın ABD Başkanı Donald Trump yönetiminde geçirdiği süre, dünyanın en zengin adamının hükümet harcamalarına balta vurduğu ve bu sırada büyük tartışmalara yol açtığı fırtınalı 129 günün ardından sona erdi.

Güney Afrika doğumlu milyarder, bu haftanın başlarında sahibi olduğu sosyal medya platformu X üzerinden Trump'a Devlet Verimlilik Dairesi'nde (DOGE) geçirdiği süre için teşekkür etti.

REKLAM

Trump ise ""Bu onun son günü ama aslında değil, çünkü o her zaman bizimle olacak ve her zaman yardım edecek"" dedi.

Musk'ın hükümetteki görevi yaklaşık dört ay sürmüş olsa da, DOGE ile yaptığı çalışmalar federal hükümeti altüst etti ve sadece Washington'daki iktidar salonlarında değil, tüm dünyada bir etki yarattı.

BBC Türkçe Musk'ın bıraktığı izlerden bazılarını ele aldı. Federal harcamalara DOGE testeresi Musk, Trump yönetiminde tek bir görevle işe başladı: Hükümet harcamalarını mümkün olduğunca kısmak. Başlangıçta ""en az 2 trilyon dolar"" hedefiyle yola çıktı, daha sonra bu hedef 1 trilyon dolar ve nihayetinde 150 milyar dolar olarak değişti. DOGE bugüne kadar varlık satışları, kira ve hibe iptalleri, ""dolandırıcılık ve uygunsuz ödemelerin silinmesi"", mevzuat tasarrufları ve 2,3 milyon kişilik federal işgücünden 260.000 kişilik bir azaltma kombinasyonu yoluyla 175 milyar dolar tasarruf sağladığını iddia ediyor. REKLAM Ancak BBC'nin bu rakamlar üzerinde yaptığı bir analiz, bazı kanıtların eksik olduğunu ortaya koymuştu. DOGE zaman zaman hem kaosa hem de tartışmalara neden oldu. Bazı örneklerde ise federal yargıçlar toplu işten çıkarmaları durdurdu ve çalışanların görevlerine iade edilmesini emretti. Diğer örneklerde ise yönetim işten çıkarmalar konusunda geri adım atmak zorunda kaldı. Bunlardan biri, Şubat ayında Ulusal Nükleer Güvenlik İdaresi'nde çalışan ve aralarında ABD'nin nükleer cephaneliğiyle ilgili hassas görevlerde bulunanların da yer aldığı yüzlerce federal çalışanın işten çıkarılmasından vazgeçilmesiydi.

Musk'ın kendisi de toplu işten çıkarmaların kaçınılmaz olarak hatalar içereceğini defalarca kabul etti. Şubat ayında, bakanlığının bir yardım programını keserken Mozambik'in bir bölgesini Hamas kontrolündeki Gazze ile karıştırmasının ardından ""Hata yapacağız"" dedi ve ekledi: ""Ancak hatalarımızı düzeltmek için hızlı hareket edeceğiz."" REKLAM Getty Images Elon Musk görev süresi boyunca Kabine toplantılarına katıldı DOGE'un verilere erişim çabaları da tartışma yarattı; özellikle de bakanlığın milyonlarca Amerikalının özel bilgilerini kontrol eden hassas hazine bakanlığı sistemlerine erişim talebi... Anketler, Musk'ın kişisel popülaritesi azalmış olsa bile, hükümet harcamalarındaki kesintilerin birçok Amerikalı arasında popüler olmaya devam ettiğini gösteriyor. Hükümet işleri ve özel işler arasında silikleşen bir çizgi ABD hükümetini müşteri olarak gören şirketlere sahip, seçilmemiş bir ""özel hükümet çalışanı"" olan Musk'ın, Beyaz Saray'daki varlığı da dikkatleri çekmiş ve olası çıkar çatışmalarına ilişkin sorulara yol açtı.

Musk'ın kurumsal imparatorluğu ABD ve yabancı hükümetlerle iş yapan büyük şirketleri içeriyor. Şirketin CEO'suna göre SpaceX'in ABD hükümetiyle 22 milyar dolarlık sözleşmesi var. Bazı Demokratlar da Musk'ı, uydu internet firması Starlink için yurtdışında iş yapmak üzere konumundan faydalanmakla suçladı. REKLAM Trump, zor durumdaki otomobil şirketi Tesla tarafından üretilen araçları Mart ayında Beyaz Saray bahçesinde sergileyerek Musk'ın işlerine yardım etmekle suçlandı. Hem Musk hem de Trump, Musk'ın hükümetle yaptığı çalışmaların çelişkili ya da etik açıdan sorunlu olduğu yönündeki iddiaları ellerinin tersiyle itti. Getty Images Donald Trump ve Elon Musk'ın oğlu X Æ A-12 ABD'yi izole etme tartışması Musk'ın DOGE ile yaptığı çalışmalar dünya çapında en çok ABD Uluslararası Kalkınma Ajansı'nın (USAID) programlarının büyük çoğunluğunun (%80'inden fazlası) altı haftalık bir incelemenin ardından elenmesinden sonra hissedildi.

Finansmanın geri kalanı ise Dışişleri Bakanlığı tarafından üstlenildi. Musk ve DOGE liderliğindeki kesintiler, Trump yönetiminin denizaşırı harcamaları ""Önce Amerika"" yaklaşımıyla daha uyumlu hale getirme çabasının bir parçasıydı. REKLAM Çatışma bölgelerinde kıtlık tespiti, aşılama ve gıda yardımı gibi işlerle görevlendirilen ajansta yapılan kesintiler, savaşın parçaladığı Sudan'daki aşevleri, Taliban'dan kaçan genç Afgan kadınlara verilen burslar ve Hindistan'da transseksüellere yönelik klinikler gibi projeleri hızla etkiledi. USAID aynı zamanda ABD'nin dünya çapındaki ""yumuşak gücünün"" önemli bir aracıydı ve bazı muhalifler USAID'in ortadan kaldırılmasını ABD'nin küresel sahnedeki etkisinin azalmasının bir işareti olarak görüyordu. Komplo teorileri ve yalan haberler Musk ve Trump, yıllardır muhalifleri tarafından asılsız komplo teorileri yaymakla suçlanırken, Musk'ın Beyaz Saray'daki varlığı, yanlış bilginin ABD hükümetinin en üst düzeylerindeki söylemlerine nasıl sızdığını açıkça ortaya koydu. Örneğin Musk, ABD altın rezervlerinin Kentucky'deki Fort Knox'tan sessizce çalındığına dair asılsız bir internet teorisini yaydı.

Bir noktada, altının güvence altına alındığından emin olmak için oraya bir ziyareti canlı yayınlama fikrini ortaya attı. Yakın zamanda Musk, Güney Afrika'nın beyaz nüfusunun kendi ülkelerinde ""soykırımla"" karşı karşıya olduğu yönünde yaygın bir şekilde çürütülmüş söylentiler yaydı. REKLAM Bu söylentiler Mayıs ayının başlarında Oval Ofis'e kadar ulaştı: ABD ile Güney Afrika arasındaki gerginliği yatıştırmayı amaçlayan bir toplantı, Trump'ın Güney Afrika Devlet Başkanı Cyril Ramaphosa'ya beyaz Afrikalılara karşı işlenen suçların kanıtı olduğunu söylediği video ve makaleleri sunmasının ardından sert bir şekilde değişti. Trump ekibi içinde ayrışmalar Musk'ın hükümetteki çalışmaları, kamuoyuna verilen birlik mesajlarına rağmen ""Trump 2.0"" yönetimi içinde gerginlikler olduğunu da gösterdi. Trump, Musk ve DOGE'un çalışmalarını alenen (ve defalarca) desteklemiş olsa da, Musk'ın görev süresi, kesintilerin kendi kurumlarını etkilediğini düşünen kabine üyeleriyle arasında yaşanan gerginlik haberleriyle geçti.",2025-06-01 08:30:57+00:00,https://www.haberturk.com/elon-musk-in-beyaz-saray-gunleri-bitti-trump-in-ekibinde-neler-basardi-3795795,

Durante décadas, el ... país ha dependido de la cooperación internacional para intentar sostener un mínimo de estabilidad institucional. Usaid, con sus programas de asistencia humanitaria y desarrollo, fue una de las pocas estructuras constantes en ese escenario volátil. Su retirada ha dejado al descubierto una realidad que nunca terminó de construirse.

Más que un actor externo, Usaid funcionaba como una estructura paralela de atención a crisis prolongadas. La RDC no es un país en pos-conflicto. Es un país en conflicto perpetuo, fragmentado por dinámicas locales de poder, economías ilícitas y luchas por los recursos. En ese contexto, los programas de Usaid cumplían una doble función: mitigar el impacto inmediato de las crisis humanitarias y establecer condiciones mínimas para resistir el colapso. Esa estructura, articulada a través de decenas de ONG locales e internacionales, era una red viva de contención social. Su desmontaje ha implicado el deterioro progresivo de esa red: clínicas móviles abandonadas, programas nutricionales detenidos, escuelas informales cerradas, redes sanitarias que colapsan frente a brotes epidémicos que se repiten cíclicamente.

La financiación internacional, incluida la de Usaid, permitía mantener este servicio. La retirada de apoyo ha dejado a muchas comunidades sin cobertura sanitaria básica Álvaro Ybarra

En regiones como Kivu del Norte y Kivu del Sur, donde el conflicto ha dejado millones de desplazados y la violencia sexual se utiliza sistemáticamente como arma de guerra, la presencia de Usaid fue durante años una de las pocas garantías de asistencia mínima. Numerosos programas ofrecían atención integral a mujeres y niñas sobrevivientes de violación: atención médica de urgencia, apoyo psicológico, rutas de protección, acceso a justicia local. Con su desaparición, muchas sobrevivientes han vuelto a quedar atrapadas en el silencio, sin recursos, sin protección y sin alternativas.

A ello se suma la desaparición de programas clave de salud materno-infantil en regiones remotas, donde dar a luz siempre fue un acto de riesgo. Las brigadas sanitarias apoyadas por Usaid permitían, al menos, reducir los índices de mortalidad en partos precarios, formar parteras tradicionales, garantizar kits básicos de higiene y seguimiento prenatal. Sin ese apoyo, aumentan las muertes evitables, tanto de madres como de recién nacidos, en zonas donde lo más básico —agua limpia, vacunas, atención primaria— ya era una excepción.

En paralelo, el desplazamiento forzado continúa sin tregua. Se estima que más de seis millones de personas viven fuera de sus hogares, muchas en asentamientos informales, sin acceso a servicios. Usaid sostenía programas de emergencia en campamentos, distribución de alimentos, educación básica, refugios temporales y acompañamiento legal. Su retirada ha dejado a comunidades enteras a merced de redes improvisadas de solidaridad o bajo el control directo de grupos armados.

La fragilidad institucional congoleña convierte cualquier crisis en una amenaza sistémica. Epidemias como el ébola, el cólera o el sarampión, que requerían intervenciones quirúrgicas y coordinadas, eran contenidas en parte por la capacidad logística y técnica de la cooperación estadounidense. La retirada de ese soporte ha obligado a muchos actores locales a improvisar con recursos insuficientes, provocando un retroceso en indicadores de salud pública que ya eran alarmantes.

Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional Qué es Usaid Usaid (United States Agency for International Developement) fue el programa de ayuda humanitaria más grande del mundo. Esta red estadounidense, financiada con 40.000 millones de dólares anuales provenientes de fondos públicos, se ha encargado de colaborar en cientos de países a lo largo de 64 años, hasta su desmantelamiento prácticamente total en febrero de 2025. Su misión se puede resumir en la promoción del desarrollo económico y social, el impulso a los valores democráticos y la respuesta a crisis humantiaras. Entre sus labores más reconocidas, la lucha contra epidemias de sida y ébola en África, la reconstrucción de Afganistán o su iniciativa 'Feed the future' contra el hambre y la pobreza en los cinco continentes.

Some commenters even said they were skipping the episode entirely — adding a layer of humor to the fact that Rogan spent part of the conversation advocating for all viewpoints to be allowed participation in the marketplace of ideas. No surprise, these listeners are not buying what Bono’s selling.

During a three-hour interview on The Joe Rogan Experience, which is streaming service Spotify’s top podcast, Bono talked about his role in encouraging former US president George W Bush to increase overseas aid spending, particularly on antiretroviral drugs intended to combat Aids.

He said a broad coalition of support for the aid spending was built and it greatly benefited the US’s image overseas. Now, he said, “all of that was torn down without a heads-up, without any notice, because people thought foreign aid was like 10 per cent of the budget or 20 per cent and it was doing things that it shouldn’t have been doing”.

“I’m sure there was some waste ... but I can tell you as a person who saw what the United States was doing around the world, I saw America display itself at its finest,” he said.

“I remember being in the Oval Office with president Bush and we had these antiretroviral drugs. I said, paint them red, white and blue, Mr President, because these are the best advertisements for America there’ll ever be.”

Irish singer Bono appeared as a guest on the Joe Rogan Experience to discuss his new book and his passion for shaking down wealthy foreign governments to give valuable taxpayer dollars to poorer nations. During their discussion, Bono uttered this whopper about what DOGE did in slashing one of the worst government agencies of all: USAID.

“It’s not proven, but surveillance suggests 300,000 people have already died from this cut-off, this hard cut of USAID,” Bono alleged. “So, there’s food rotting in boats and warehouses…This will f**k you off.”

“No American will be happy. There is 50,000 tons of food that are stored in Djibouti, South Africa, Dubai, and wait for it, Houston, Texas that is rotting,” he added. “Because the people who know the codes at the warehouses are fired, they’re gone.”

There is absolutely no evidence that these needed USAID cuts are responsible for any deaths in the world. But Bono has never been one to care about the truth.

Thankfully, Rogan disagreed with Bono’s garbage. Instead, he calmly countered with the cold, hard truth.

“There have been a lot of organizations that have done a tremendous amount of good all throughout the world,” Rogan countered. “Also, for sure, it was a money-laundering operation.”

“For sure, there was no oversight, for sure, billions of dollars were missing,” he continued. “In fact, trillions that are unaccounted for were sent off to (who knows) where, because there are no receipts.”

A medicine stock-out is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “any time when, at a defined moment in a given inventory, a needed medicine item is not in stock and orders or prescriptions cannot be filled.” The WHO has published a set of indicators for use in optimising the management of pharmaceutical stocks, in order to avoid stock-outs and the related but separate problem of overstocking. There is some evidence that use of the WHO’s indicators can help avoid these problems.

Drug shortages—causes and solutions The operational definition of a drug shortage that my colleagues and I published two years ago12 included a range of methods for avoiding or dealing with shortages, tailored to the individual causes. The causes of drug shortages are complex, and there are many possible solutions. When they can be predicted it may be possible to mitigate them. For example, if a manufacturer plans to cease production for any reason, an advertised lead-in time will give the opportunity for a replacement to be made available, by obtaining or synthesising new stocks of the drug itself or instead by making available a suitable substitute, such as a me-too product or a biosimilar. When a shortage is not predicted other solutions may be required, and everyone in the supply chain is involved in anticipating and managing shortages, with responsibilities for preventing them or at least trying to mitigate their effects. This includes manufacturers and suppliers, particularly of generic formulations, pharmacists, prescribers, patients, and governments. Many solutions have been proposed and are listed in our previous review.2

Drug stock-outs—causes A drug stock-out denotes the complete absence of a medicine from the shelves of any outlet that would be expected to stock it, typically a pharmacy. It has been variously defined as an inability of a pharmacy to deliver a drug to a patient, zero usable stock, complete absence of a medicine in stock, no “medicine facility shelf,” and absence of a medicine at a health facility level. Although a stock-out need not imply a general shortage, there are difficulties in defining exactly when one turns into the other. And although the term “shortage” is often used to describe a deficiency throughout a single country, some have also described what they have called national stock-outs. To the extent that drug stock-outs, however defined, can be caused by factors that also cause shortages, the same solutions will apply. However, most stock-outs are caused not by the factors that cause more general shortages, but by a range of other factors, generally related to poor management at a local level.3 Problems include local funding difficulties, difficulty in procurement and transport, insufficient or poorly trained staff, and poor data management, including inaccurate tracking of the use of products, insufficient control of replenishment, and poor inventory management. Parallel trade, in which goods are bought cheaply in one place to be sold at a profit elsewhere, has also occasionally been blamed.

Drug stock-outs—monitoring and evaluation In order to prevent stock-outs and assess the performance of medicines procurement and supply systems, specifically related to the treatment of HIV infection, tuberculosis, and malaria, the WHO has published a document describing indicators for doing so.4 The recommendations are also intended to prevent the related but separate problem of overstocking. In the document a stock-out is defined as “any time when, at a defined moment in a given inventory, a needed medicine item is not in stock and orders or prescriptions cannot be filled.” The document does not specify the extent to which the medicine is not available, for example, in a single outlet, such as a hospital or community pharmacy, or in many outlets, but the document describes 12 core indicators for use in monitoring national procurement and supply management systems, and it therefore elevates stock-outs to the level of national shortages in countries in which such systems exist. However, I see no reason why the six early warning indicators described in the document could not also be applied to any single outlet or coordinated group of outlets in which the necessary data on procurement and supply are collected and stored and available for analysis. The other six guidelines are applicable only to national systems. In addition to the six early warning indicators outlined in the document, designed to prevent stock-outs and overstocking, there are six performance indicators for measuring and assessing the performance of the system. Each indicator is associated with a target, which, if not met, should trigger corrective actions. This implies undertaking regular monitoring and evaluation of information that is routinely collected and stored. In national schemes this also implies that such information can be analysed centrally. The document defines monitoring in this context as “routine, timely tracking of the performance of continuous record-keeping, reporting or surveillance systems.” And it defines evaluation as “episodic assessment of progress towards a programme’s targets.” For some of the 12 indicators the target is 100%; for others it is either 0% or at least less than 1%; and in one case, a ratio involving price, it is less than 1, i.e. the cost to the system should be no greater than the international reference standard. Indicator 12 has three subsets with targets of either 0% or 100% and one subset relating to duration of stock-outs, the target for which is zero. Almost all of the targets are extreme, for example “100%” without qualification, implying little or no tolerance on either side of the target. One target is “As close as possible to 100%” and another is “As close as possible to 0 [days].” One cannot deny that perfection is highly desirable, even if it is unlikely to be attainable. The corrective actions to be taken if a target is not met are specified for each indicator.

The indicators The 12 indicators are numbered 1 to 12, but here I list first the six early warning indicators and then the others. The document is long and not always easy to read. I have therefore simplified the descriptions of the indicators that it gives. Six early warning indicators 3: The amounts of products actually received during a defined period compared with the total planned for the same period (target 100%). 4: The amounts used compared with the total available, ignoring buffer stock (target 100%). 6A: The percentage of orders delivered in full and on time (target 100%). 8: The percentage of treatment sites that received all orders in full and on time during a defined period (target 100%). 9: The percentage of treatment sites that submitted complete inventory control reports on time during a defined period (target 100%). 11: The percentage of treatment sites that placed orders during a defined period while the stock in hand of one or more items was below minimum (target 0%). Performance indicators 1: The percentage of items received or planned to be received that are in the national standard treatment guidelines (target 100%). 2A: The percentage of patients receiving antiretroviral and antituberculosis treatments in line with national standard treatment guidelines (target 100%). 2B: The percentage of patients starting treatment with antiretroviral drugs consistent with first-line regimens in national standard treatment guidelines (target 100%). 5: The ratio between the median cost of products procured and the international median reference value (target ≤1). 6B1: The percentage of orders to be cleared from the port of entry that were cleared before the deadline (target 100%). 6B2: The average number of days between arrival at and clearance from the port of entry. 7: The percentage of product batches tested in the past year that met national and international quality control standards (target 100%). 10: The percentage of the amounts of each product lost per total available for use in the past year (target <1%) 12: The percentage of treatment sites that had a stock-out of one or more required medicines during a defined period (target 0%) If this target is not reached: 12A1: The percentage of available items at each treatment site (target 100%) 12A2: The average percentage of items available at all treatment sites 12B: The percentage of treatment sites that had a stock-out of a particular product during a defined period (target 0%) 12C1: The average duration of stock-outs at each treatment site during a defined period (target 0 days) 12C2: The average duration of stock-outs at all treatment sites during a defined period.

Studies using the indicators When the six early warning indicators were used to assess a drug management system nationwide in Nigeria in 2012 in the prevention of stock-outs and overstocking of antituberculosis drugs, they were found to be useful in avoiding stock-outs that affected patient management.5 In one study covid-19 increased the frequency of stock-outs6 and in another study of 10 hospitals and 12 health centres inventory management was poor and stock-outs were common.7 Although in both studies the WHO indicators were used as a basis for studying the problem, in addition to national guidelines and the Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool (LIAT) of the USAID Deliver Project,8 there was no indication that the institutions studied were using the WHO’s indicators to inform stock control.

A final comment Stock-outs are not limited to medicines outlets. They apply to any outlet purveying goods of any sort. The problem of stock-outs in general is therefore well known, and several websites contain information about their causes and possible solutions. The lists of solutions typically include such items as improving demand forecasting, keeping customers informed, developing strong relationships with suppliers, automating inventory management and using software with automated alerts, auditing stock regularly, and maintaining a buffer stock. However, solutions that may be helpful in maintaining satisfactory stocks of other items may not necessarily be applicable to pharmaceutical products. Hence the need for specific guidance. If the Nigerian result cited above is anything to go by, the WHO’s early warning indicators commend themselves to all pharmacies, wherever they are, as a way of avoiding or at least reducing the risk of drug stock-outs and preventing overstocking. According to Google Scholar, the WHO’s document has been cited only 14 times. Unsurprisingly, given the intention of the guidance, the countries of origin of the first authors on 10 of the papers were in Africa (three in Ethiopia and one each in Nigeria and Sudan) and Asia (four in Indonesia and one in Thailand). Two came from the USA, one using data from Cameroon, Namibia, and Swaziland and one from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Two papers came from the WHO. I don’t know how widely the indicators are used globally. Perhaps they should be used more often.

The U2 frontman and humanitarian joined Rogan on The Joe Rogan Experience this week and the pair debated some of Trump’s drastic spending cuts, including effectively shuttering USAID. Bono, a musician and activist, referenced a report suggesting that humanitarian programs being cut through USAID have led to 300,000 deaths around the world.

He appeared to be referencing a study from Boston University infectious disease mathematical modeler Brooke Nichols, who argued that most of those deaths would be children.

Bono said:

It’s not proven, but there’s surveillance enough to suggest 300,000 people have already died from just this cut off, this hard cut of USAID. So there’s food rotting in boats, in warehouses. There is, this will fuck you off, this will not, you will not be happy, no American will, but there is, I think it’s 50,000 tons of food that are stored in Djibouti, South Africa, Dubai, and wait for it, Houston, Texas. And that is rotting rather than going to Gaza, rather than to Sudan, because the people who know the codes for the warehouse are fired, they’re gone. And so this, I don’t know, I just, what do you think, what is that? That’s not America, is it?

Rogan said the Trump administration is “throwing the baby out with the bath water,” but he argued USAID’s distribution of funds was not closely watched enough.

“The problem is, for sure, there have been a lot of organizations that do tremendous good all throughout the world. Also for sure it was a money laundering operation. For sure there was no oversight. For sure billions of dollars are missing,” he said.

Rogan did admit that Trump’s USAID cuts were too hasty, chalking it up to the administration trying to do as much they can before the midterms.

The podcaster explained:

The whole thing is there’s a lot of fraud, a lot of money laundering, but also, we help the world. And when you’re talking about making wells for people in the Congo to get fresh water, when you talk about food and medicine to places that don’t have access, like, no way that should have been cut out. And that should’ve been clear before they make these radical cuts. Like, there’s got to be a way to keep aid and not have fraud. And you can’t say we’re gonna kill everything so that there’s no fraud. But then you’re killing all the good and you’re doing it without letting anybody know it’s gonna happen.

Bono argued that the United States’ humanitarian efforts are necessary and what the rest of the world looks to them for.

“I mean If it’s big government or whatever, people wanna shrink, I get the instinct, but this, the life-saving part, it’s like the little finger of the giant,” he said.

DOGE’s crack team of mostly young techies shined a light on surreal instances of fraud and waste— from the literal mine where all federal government employee resignations are processed by hand to millions of dollars in fake unemployment claims filed with birth dates 15 years in the future.

But for all of the fanfare, outrage, and outright hysteria over DOGE’s supposedly drastic measures, the department’s actual power was limited to mostly cancelling grants and contracts, which put a major cap on how much in savings could actually be realized.

Much of the discretionary spending it lined up for the chopping block was approved by Congress, and Congress alone can decide its fate.

Republicans can make sure that DOGE’s efforts aren’t fruitless, and should, as quickly as possible.

First, pass the $9.4 billion “rescissions package” that the White House plans to deliver to the House on Tuesday, which will claw back $8.3 billion in foreign aid from the African Development Foundation and the US Agency for International Development.

USAID, which Team Trump has near-totally dismantled, absolutely deserves such a slash: It bankrolled a mess of beyond-parody projects, like sending terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki to college and improving LGBT workplace inclusion in Serbia.

The package will also yank $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees PBS and NPR.

NPR and PBS long ago abandoned their role as nonpartisan public resources; both should have to rely on the non-government funding they insist dwarfs what the feds now provide.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has promised to bring the package to the floor pronto and get it passed; the Senate should follow suit.

But $9.4 billion is barely a drop in the bucket of the $1.9 trillion deficit, and far below the $175 billion in savings that DOGE touts on its website — a figure that represents more than $1,000 per US taxpayer if Congress can keep following up.

That means the recessions package can only be the start: The next round of federal budgeting must aim to translate the majority of the DOGE savings into law, over the screams of special interests and other feeders at the federal trough, Democratic distortions amplified by the lefty media, and the fears of weaker-willed Republicans.

Once agencies get used to their bloated budgets, wrenching money (no matter how ill-spent) back is an exercise in teeth-pulling; expect a lot of kicking and screaming.

Though Musk won’t be as hands-on at DOGE, the department’s work isn’t over; much of the team he hired will stick around, battling the fund-sucking bureaucracy.

Some DOGE employees have been embedded into permanent roles at other agencies to keep on cutting waste, such as Jeremy Lewin at the State Department, and Stephanie Holmes and Tyler Hassen at the Interior.

Musk didn’t hit the (always unlikely) $2 trillion-in-savings goal he had on Day 1 of DOGE, but the effort drew crucial attention to Uncle Sam’s incomparable talent for misspending taxpayer money.

The cat is out of the bag; as voters long suspected, the feds are taking way more money than they need.

During the episode, Bono confronted Rogan — a friend of the now-outgoing DOGE head Elon Musk — about a study that warned that 300,000 people worldwide might die from the cuts at USAID, which distributes food, clean water, and medical supplies to over 120 countries.

“There’s food rotting in boats and warehouses,” Bono said on The Joe Rogan Experience. “There is 50,000 tons of food. The people who knew the codes — who were responsible for distributing that aid — were fired. That’s not America, is it?

“To destroy, to vandalize, it felt like with glee, that these life support systems were being pulled out of the walls,” Bono continued, “[One aide worker said], ‘We don’t have the funds, we have to choose which child to pull off the IVs.’ It just seems to me, I don’t know if ‘evil’ is too strong a word, but what we know about pure evil is that it rejoices in the deaths, in the squandering of human life — particularly children. It actually rejoices in it. And whether it’s incompetence, whether it’s unintended consequences, it’s not too late for people.”

Rogan responded by calling the imperfect, somewhat mismanaged USAID and with its “trillion” dollar losses a “money-laundering operation” with “no oversight, no receipts.” The singer pushed back, reiterating both the necessity of USAID and America’s role and responsibility in providing aid amid the Trump administration’s isolationist lean.

“I just want to remind Americans of the size of their country, and I’m not talking about the geography,” Bono said. “The size of the idea, it’s just an extraordinary thing. It’s an idea big enough to fit the whole world, and when it becomes an island rather than a continent … when it shrinks, America seems to stop being America.”

Rogan acquiesced in part, “We help the world, and when you’re talking about making wells for people in the Congo to get fresh water, when you’re talking about food and medicine to places that don’t have access, no way that should have been cut out. And that should have been clear before they make these radical cuts.

The podcast host added, “The ironic thing is, even though Elon Musk has proposed all these things and the DOGE committee has proposed all these things, they’ve made no cuts in terms of the budget … They’ve cut nothing.”

Unemployed, I spent a week in April digging a small pond in our back yard. At the time, it was a distraction. Now it is… actually, a different sort of distraction.



Because although it’s not a very big pond — about 3 meters by 2, maximum depth about 70 cm — it has very quickly and suddenly filled up with life. The first water skater appeared literally on day one. Now there are about a dozen of them. We’ve also picked up water beetles, a couple of aquatic snails, some little swimming shrimp-like things, and several of these guys:







Ichthyosaura alpestris, “fish-lizard of the Alps”, aka the Alpine Newt.



But how did they get there?



In brief: your Alpine Newt will spend nine months of the year on land, slithering around in the leaf mold in forests and brushy meadows, gobbling up insects and other small invertebrates. But in early summer, they look for water, because they need water to breed. So there were probably some around in our yard and in the vacant lots nearby. And when suddenly we added our little pond to the local ecosystem, well, we basically set up a singles bar for newts.



They’re cool little guys. They’re about 10 cm or 4 inches long — about as long as your middle finger, say — and they mostly hang out at the bottom of the pond. But every 5 or 10 minutes they’ll swim up to the surface in a very leisurely sort of way, take a gulp of air, and then swim back down. There are at least four of them, but sometimes we’ll only see one, or none. We assume that’s because they’re out hunting, returning to the pond to rest.



(And to get it on, presumably. But apparently they only do that around dawn. Dawn in northern Bavaria in May comes at 5 AM. There are things that will get me out of bed at 5 AM, but hoping to catch newts in flagrante doesn’t quite qualify.)



Anyway. Remember my post a couple of months back about the blue-ringed octopus? Well, it turns out the newt shares a trick with that pretty little mollusc: they both have tetrodotoxin. Unlike the lovely but lethal blue-ring, the newt only produces a modest amount. If you ate one, your mouth would go numb, and then you’d probably have nausea, maybe muscle spasms, and perhaps some difficulty breathing for a while, but you wouldn’t die. A smaller predator like a bird or a raccoon would have it worse, but still probably wouldn’t die. But it would (presumably) be a nasty enough experience that the predator wouldn’t much care to repeat it.



Which is why the newts look the way they do. Their backs and sides are a mottled grey-green, great natural camouflage. But their throats and bellies are bright orange. So camouflage is their first line of defense; they’re not toxic enough to advertise openly, like an Amazonian poison frog or such. But if threatened or cornered, they may raise their heads to display their bright orange undersides: warning! I taste nasty and will make you sick!



— And how does the newt get the tetrodotoxin? This is one of those things where you can’t just read wikipedia. You have to search for papers, like people did in medieval times.







[Melnikova and Magarlinov, ibid. The green bits are probably safe to eat.]



Turns out the newt, like the octopus, gets its tetrodotoxin from symbiotic bacteria. They live mostly in glands in the newt’s skin — that’s the cutout at lower left — but also in the ovaries, which is why the ovaries are bright red. Makes sense, right? The newt wants to pass the bacteria on to its children, and the bacteria want to be passed.



What’s interesting is that the newt is toxic, but it’s not very toxic. Presumably that’s because supporting all these bacteria carries a metabolic cost. So, becoming more toxic still — evolving into a newt version of the blue-ringed octopus — isn’t worth the trouble.



(There are a couple of newt species in North America that have done this, becoming much more toxic, to the point where they could seriously injure or kill an adult human. We think we know why, and it’s because of reasons that are beyond the scope of this short blog post. That said, American readers please attend: don’t lick newts.)



So, Elon Musk destroys USAID -> I’m unemployed, dig a pond -> newts hooking up -> tetrodotoxin. And that’s our set of unexpected connections for this week.

A parlamenti honlap üvegzseb oldalán közzétett megbízásra nem vonatkoznak a közbeszerzési törvény szabályai, tehát ezért a munkáért nem kellett versenyezni.

A cikk szerint a Fidesz parlamenti képviselőcsoportja nagyon elégedett lehet a szolgáltatással, hiszen 2021 óta következetesen ezt a céggel bízzák meg online hirdetéssel. Pedig – mint a Magyar Hang megjegyzi – az RTDCOM Kft.-nek lényegében nincs szakmai múltja a hirdetői piacon, a kormánypárti szerződéseket leszámítva. Sőt, honlapjuk sincs. A kétszemélyes mikrocég a 77 éves Poysl Ferenc vállalkozása, a kft.-t pedig egy kőbányai családi házba jegyezték be.

A HVG korábban írt már egy másik, hasonló összértékű szerződésről, azt is idén tavasszal, a Fidesz-frakció nevében kötötte Kocsisa Máté. Egy 230 milliós és egy másik, 270 milliós szerződésről van szó, tehát összesen félmilliárd forint értékben rendeltek „audiovizuális médiaszolgáltatás(ok)ra szánt műsorszám előállítást” a TV Com Kft.-től. A cég ügyvezetője Kálomista Márton, a NER egyik kedvenc kurzusfilmese, az ElkXrtuk producere, Kálomista Gábor fia.

Félmilliárdért bízta meg a Fidesz-frakció videókészítéssel a Kálomista Gábor fia által vezetett céget A Fidesz már el is kezdte szórni a nemrég jelentősen megemelt, a parlamenti frakciók által elkölthető közpénzkeretét. Két friss szerződéssel 500 millió forintért bízta meg a kurzusfilmes Kálomista Gábor fia által vezetett műsorgyártó céget videók készítésével.

Később az is kiderült, hogy mit takar a TV Com-os két szerződés: az összesen félmilliárdért rendelt alkotások közül az egyik propagandafilm „a USAID-botrányként ismert nemzetközi politikai és médiakorrupciós hálózat magyarországi szálairól” szól majd, míg a másiknak „az európai migrációs válság 10 éves története” lesz a témája.

The San Francisco-based US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 opinion Friday declined to let the Trump administration proceed with its staffing cuts, following a pause by a federal judge earlier this month to its reductions in force (RIFs) efforts overseen by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

At issue was Trump’s Feb. 13 executive order demanding the “large-scale reductions in force” to federal agencies, which prompted a coalition of unions, non-profits and local governments to sue.

“The Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the President’s supervisory powers under the Constitution,” wrote Circuit Judge William Fletcher, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.

“The President enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies,” he added. “But even that power is not unlimited.”

The majority opinion, joined by Biden-appointed Circuit Judge Lucy Koh, also noted “cuts of up to 50%” of Department of Energy staff, the elimination of AmeriCorps volunteer youth programs and the layoffs of thousands of other probationary employees in the government.

Circuit Judge Consuelo Maria Callahan in a dissenting opinion charged that the plaintiffs were “bypassing the comprehensive administrative scheme that Congress has enacted to handle federal sector labor and employment disputes.”

“The district court nevertheless entertained Plaintiffs’ claims and concluded that the Executive’s actions likely violate separation of powers — without making any finding that any agency’s RIF is likely to violate any statute,” wrote Callahan, an appointee of former President George W. Bush.

“The court then entered a sweeping preliminary injunction that strips the Executive of control over its own personnel,” she disputed the lower court ruling, noting the Trump administration was likely to succeed in the case.

The Trump administration had previously asked the US Supreme Court to intervene and allow the federal workforce restructuring initiated by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget — but the high court has yet to take up the case.

US District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco granted a temporary restraining order on the restructuring for 14 days, ruling May 9 that Trump officials had made the move without congressional authorization.

“The Court here is not considering the potential loss of income of one individual employee, but the widespread termination of salaries and benefits for individuals, families, and communities,” Illston wrote.

On May 22, the California judge extended that to a preliminary injunction, initiating the appeal to the federal circuit court.

“A single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields fired back in a statement.

“The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch — singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda.”

Fotoğraf altı yazısı, Donald Trump ve Elon Musk arasındaki gerginlik büyüyor.

31 Mayıs 2025 Güncelleme 11 Haziran 2025

Dünyanın en zengin insanı Elon Musk, ABD Başkanı Donald Trump'ı hedef alan bazı paylaşımlarından pişman olduğunu söyledi.

Musk atışma sırasında yaptığı X paylaşımlarından bazılarını sildi.

53 yaşındaki Musk, bazı paylaşımlarının ""çok ileri gittiğini"" de söyledi ancak bunların hangileri olduğunu açıklamadı.

Musk, sildiği paylaşımlardan birinde, Trump'ın görevden alınmasına destek veriyordu.

Musk bu paylaşımlardan birinde Trump'ın azledilmesi ve yeni başkanın Başkan Yardımcısı JD Vance olması gerektiğini de savunmuştu.

İkili arasındaki söz düellosu, Trump'ın 500 milyar dolarlık harcama tasarısı ile başladı.

Musk, Trump'ın savunduğu paketin bütçe açığını çok artıracağını savunmuş ve paket için ""iğrenç"" ifadeleri kullanmıştı.

ABD Başkanı Donald Trump ve Musk arasındaki gerilim, 5 Haziran'da karşılıklı sert açıklamalarla söz düellosuna dönüştü.

Trump ve Musk hem birbirlerini tehdit etti hem de hakaret içeren sözler söyledi.

Musk, Trump'ın isminin Jeffrey Epstein belgelerinde olduğunu iddia etti.

Cezaevinde intihar eden Epstein, reşit olmayan kız çocuklarının da bulunduğu çok sayıda kişiye cinsel tacizde bulunmak ve seks amaçlı insan kaçakçılığı yapmakla suçlanıyordu.

Demokratlar üstü kapalı iddialara yanıt talep etti.

Atışmadan bir hafta sonra Musk'a yakın kaynaklar, iş adamının Trump ile arasını düzeltmek istediğini aktarıyor.

İkili arasındaki atışmanın bu noktaya varmasıyla, dünyanın en zengin insanı Elon Musk'ın sahibi olduğu elektrikli araç devi Tesla'nın hisseleri bir günde yüzde 14 değer kaybetmişti.

11 Haziran itibariyle Tesla'nın değeri yeniden 1 trilyon doların üzerine çıktı.

Trump ne diyor?

6 Haziran Cuma günü Trump, CNN'e yaptığı açıklamada, ""Elon'u düşünmüyorum bile. Bir sorunu var. Zavallı adamın gerçekten bir sorunu var"" dedi.

Daha önce ABC News'e verdiği demeçte ise Musk'tan ""aklını kaçırmış bir adam"" diye söz etmişti.

Fox News de, politika muhabiri Bret Baier'e konuşan Trump'ın ""Elon tamamen aklını kaçırmış"" dediğini aktardı.

'Ben olmasam kazanamazdı'

Musk seçim kampanyasında Trump'a büyük maddi destek vermiş, yaklaşık 250 milyon dolar harcamıştı.

Musk yaptığı paylaşımlardan birinde, ""Ben olmasam kazanamazdı"" ifadesini de kullandı.

Trump ikinci kez ABD Başkanı seçilip 20 Ocak'ta görevi devralmasının ardından Musk'ı yeni oluşturduğu Hükümet Verimliliği Departmanı'nın (DOGE) başına getirmişti.

Seçim zaferinin sembol isimlerinden olan Musk, Trump'ın danışmanlığı görevini Mayıs ayı içinde bıraktı.

Musk, Trump'ı hedef aldığı paylaşımlardan birinde, başkanı nankörlükle de suçladı, desteği olmadan seçimleri kazanamayacağını da söyledi.

Kaynak, Reuters Fotoğraf altı yazısı, Geçmişte çok iyi arkadaş olan Elon Musk ve Donald Trump arasındaki gerginlik daha da artacağa benziyor

'Epstein dosyaları' iddiası nasıl gündeme geldi?

Trump atışma sırasında, Musk'ın Amerikan hükümetiyle imzaladığı tüm sözleşmeleri iptal edebileceğini duyurdu.

Bu anlaşmalar arasında NASA - SpaceX de yer alıyordu.

Musk bunun üzerine Trump'a yönelik eleştirilerini daha da artırdı.

Musk, Trump'ın, kamuoyunda Epstein dosyaları olarak bilinen ve kız çocuklarına cinsel istismar ağı oluşturma suçlamalarıyla yargılanırken hapiste ölü bulunan milyarder Jeffrey Epstein dosyalarında adının geçtiğini iddia etti.

""Gerçekten büyük bombayı bırakma zamanı geldi"" diyen Musk, Epstein dosyalarının kamuoyuna açıklanmamasının nedeninin de bu olduğunu öne sürdü.

Amerikan Federal Soruşturma Bürosu (FBI), Musk'ın Trump'ın adının Epstein dosyalarında geçtiğine yönelik iddiaları hakkında yorum yapmayacağını açıkladı.

Ancak görünürdeki bu uyum yaklaşık 48 saat sürdü. Musk, hafta sonu Trump'ın sözde ""büyük, güzel"" harcama tasarısını sert şekilde eleştirmeye başladı, hatta yasa tasarısı için ""iğrenç"" ifadesini kullandı.

Bugün Başkan Trump'ın ilk kez şahsen Musk'a yanıt verdiğini gördük. Trump, Beyaz Saray'da konuşurken Musk'ın kendisini ""çok büyük hayal kırıklığına uğrattığını"" söyledi.

Trump, insanların kendi yörüngesinden çıktıklarında genellikle düşmanca tavırlar sergilediklerini ve ""Trump Delilik Sendromu""na kurban gittiklerini iddia etti.

Musk bunun üzerine kendi platformu olan X'te Başkan Trump'a sert şekilde yüklendi. Onu nankörlükle suçladı ve kendisinin desteği olmadan seçimi kazanamayacağını öne sürdü.

Biden váratlan bejelentése épp aközben került a címlapokra, hogy két újságíró, Jake Tapper és Alex Thompson az újonnan megjelent, Eredendő bűn című kötetét népszerűsíti, mely részletes képet ad arról, hogy miképp igyekezett elkendőzni a demokrata vezetésű Fehér Ház a most 82 éves Biden szellemi és egészségügyi állapotromlását. De nemcsak a kormányzat végrehajtói ága bővelkedik a matuzsálemekben: ha a törvényhozást nézzük, idén már a harmadik hivatalban lévő demokrata alsóházi képviselő hunyt el – ezen pedig akár Trump adócsökkentési törvényének megakadályozása is múlhatott, amely csak egyetlen vokssal csúszott át az alsóházon. Így kiváltképp az ellenzékbe és identitásválságba került Demokrata Párt köreiben indult el a zúgolódás a generációváltás szükségességéről, jóllehet az átlagos republikánus sem sokkal fiatalabb. Bár az évtizedek alatt megszilárdult gerontokrácia megszüntetése nem megy egyik napról a másikra.

A képviselőházi demokraták nyilvánosan hadakoznak a legidősebb törvényhozóik miatt (The Wall Street Journal).

Néhány közelmúltbeli szalagcím az amerikai sajtóból, és mindegyik a belpolitika „nyugdíjasklubbá” változásáról szól. Az elmúlt években bejárták a világot azok a felvételek, amelyeken Mitch McConnell, a republikánusok előző szenátusi frakcióvezetője többször is lefagyott az újságírók előtt, vagy a néhai Dianne Feinstein demokrata szenátor összezavarodik vagy kerekesszékkel tolják be a Capitolium épületébe. De bőven elég visszagondolni a tavalyi elnökválasztásra: ha Joe Biden nem kényszerült volna visszalépésre – elsősorban az életkorából fakadó aggályok miatt –, potenciális második ciklusa végére, 2029-re a 87. évét taposta volna. Ám a végül győzedelmeskedő Donald Trump így is a valaha volt legidősebb elnökként tette le az esküt idén januárban, mandátuma lejárta előtt pedig már 82 gyertyát fog elfújni a születésnapi tortáján.

Az amerikai politikusok – kiváltképp az elnökök – egészségügyi állapota az utóbbi hetekben ismét reflektorfénybe került, hiszen több kötet is megjelent a 2024-es kampány hátteréről, illetve arról, hogy Biden belső köre hogyan igyekezte „menedzselni” az idősödő elnök állapotát. Alex Thompson, az Eredendő bűn (Original Sin) egyik szerzője és az Axios riportere már 2023 áprilisában beszámolt arról, hogy Biden legtöbb programját kizárólag hétköznap délelőtt 10 és délután 4 óra közé időzítették a lecsökkent munkabírása miatt. Thompson később arról is írt, hogy Biden tanácsadói mindent megtettek azért, hogy a lehető legkevesebb kellemetlen szituációba keveredjen az idős elnök, aki egy 2023-as esése után gyakran viselt teniszcipőt, hogy kisebb eséllyel botoljon fel; kísérettel sétált a helikopteréhez a Fehér Ház déli gyepén, hogy elfedjék a legyengült járását; és az elnöki gépre való felszálláshoz is rövidebb lépcsősort használt a biztonság kedvéért.

A több mint 200 demokrata párti bennfentessel készített interjú alapján összeállított könyvből, melyet Thompson Jake Tapperrel, a CNN műsorvezetőjével közösen írt, arra is fény derült, hogy miközben a Fehér Ház azt bizonygatta, hogy Biden egészséges, mint a makk, a félrebeszélése nem az idősödés jele, a bakijairól készült egyes videók pedig „olcsó hamisítványok”,

az elnök tanácsadói a színfalak mögött szót ejtettek arról, hogy újraválasztása esetén Bidennek kerekesszékre lehet majd szüksége – főleg, ha még egyszer megbotlana, és további sérüléseket szenvedne a gerince.

Mint kiderült, az is megesett, hogy Biden saját tanácsadóit vagy George Clooney-t nem ismerte fel, vagy szólította rossz néven. Ez persze csak a jéghegy csúcsa, a könyv rengeteg kérdést felvet arról, hogy a „jobb és rosszabb napokkal bíró” Bidennek, akit kabinettagjai elől is valósággal dugdostak 2023 után, mekkora rálátása volt valójában az adminisztráció döntéseire és működésére. No meg arra is keresi a választ, hogy bizonyos szereplők mekkora felelősséggel bírtak az állapota elkendőzésében – legyen szó a fehér házi tanácsadókról, a pártról és egyes politikusokról, a médiáról, a Biden családról és végső soron magáról az elnökről –, és a legyengülése dacára miért akart még négy évet szolgálni.

A korábbi first lady, Jill Biden a The View című magazinműsorban úgy reagált minderre a férje oldalán, hogy

azok, akik ezeket a könyveket írták, nem voltak velünk a Fehér Házban, és nem látták, milyen keményen dolgozott Joe minden egyes nap.

De persze ott van a 2024-es vereség kérdése is. A Thompsonéknak megszólaló David Plouffe, Barack Obama és Kamala Harris egyik kampánystratégája például teljes mértékben Bidenre fogta ezt, mondván, az okozta Harris alulmaradását, hogy az elnök túl későn szállt ki a versenyből.

Teljesen kib---ott velünk

- mondta a tanácsadó a 82 éves politikusról.

Mindennek a közepébe a volt elnök közelmúltbeli rákdiagnózisa csak olaj volt a tűzre,

már ami az eltussolásról szóló találgatásokat illeti. Jóllehet az amerikai nyilvánosság túlnyomó része együttérzését fejezte ki Biden felé, több szakember a meglepettségét fejezte ki azzal kapcsolatban, hogy nem észlelték az áttétes daganatot hamarabb – hiszen a mindenkori elnököt rendszeresen kivizsgálja a Fehér Ház orvosa.

Nem az elmúlt 100-200 napban alakult ki. […] Valószínűleg már az elnöksége kezdetén, 2021-ben is megvolt neki. Nem hiszem, hogy ezt bárki is vitatná

– nyilatkozta a liberális oldalhoz húzó MSNBC-nek Dr. Zeke Emanuel, aki Biden koronavírus-járványügyi tanácsában is részt vett. Emanuel hozzátette: „vagy nem tesztelték, vagy tesztelték, de nem számoltak be róla. És mi, a köznyilvánosság nem kaptuk meg az információt.”

Biden szóvivőjének ezután kiadott közleménye szerint a politikust 2014 óta nem szűrték prosztataspecifikus-antigénre. Az éppen regnáló elnök egészsége körüli vélt vagy valós titkolózás azonban nem demokrata sajátosság. Ahogy Alex Thompson is megemlítette egy interjúban,

bár nem tudtunk sokat Joe Biden egészségéről, Donald Trumpéról még kevesebb információt tudunk.

De nemcsak az elnököket elnézve, a Kongresszusra pillantva is egyértelmű, hogy mindkét párt sorai között ülnek magukat többé-kevésbé jól tartó szépkorúak. A 2023 és 2025 közötti, 118. volt tekinthető az Egyesült Államok harmadik „legöregebb” Kongresszusának, ekkor rekordot döntött az alsóház tagjainak 58,9 éves, a felsőháznak pedig a 65,3 éves medián életkora.

Az amerikai gerontokráciát 2022-ben külön cikksorozatban körüljáró Business Insider ábráján egyértelműen látható, ahogy a ’80-as évektől kezdődően kilő a 70 év feletti politikusok részaránya a Kongresszusban, ami korábban sosem látott szintre emelkedett. Ezzel párhuzamosan növekedett a Capitolium épületében serénykedő törvényhozók medián életkora is, ami három évtized leforgása alatt nőtt 50-ről több mint 60 évre.

this is a direct consequence of policy, not a coincidence pic.twitter.com/hB4lr0B4Vz — Walter (Hickey) May 21, 2025

Az Economist szerint az Egyesült Államok törvényhozóinak körülbelül 45%-a volt 60 év feletti tavaly nyáron, ami az OECD-országok közül a legmagasabb arány. A 38 tagállam átlaga egyébként mindössze 19%, Dánia, Belgium és Kolumbia parlamentjei a „legfiatalabbak”. Ennek ellenére a Pew Research Center számításai szerint az előző kétéves ciklushoz képest mostanra kissé fiatalodott a washingtoni törvényhozás: a képviselőház tagjainak medián életkora jelenleg 57,5 év, míg a felsőház esetében ez most 64,7 év. (Előbbi esetén a választhatósághoz szükséges minimum életkor 25, utóbbinál 30 év.)

Ami pártok közötti életkorkülönbséget illeti, az alsóházi demokraták átlagéletkora 57,6, míg a republikánusoké 57,5 év, azaz lényegében nincs eltérés. Ám a szenátusban a demokraták átlagéletkora 66 év, ami valamivel magasabb, mint a republikánusoké (64,5 év).

Thats down from 57.9 at the start of the 118th Congress (2023-25), 58.9 in the 117th Congress (2021-23), 58.0 in the 116th (2019-21) and 58.4 in the 115th (2017-19). pic.twitter.com/ovmJD246c9 — Pew (Research) January 21, 2025

Miközben igyekeznek talpra állni a tavalyi csalódás után, a demokraták idősödő politikusaira mégis extra figyelem hárul: az átlagéletkor tekintetében valóban nem feltűnő a különbség a két párt között,

ugyanakkor szembetűnő, hogy a képviselőház 15 legidősebb, 80 év feletti tagja között csak három republikánus található, a többi mind demokrata.

Many people are saying https://t.co/LwL4Ttj4Sj — Eli (McKown-Dawson) May 21, 2025

Ráadásul 2022 óta kizárólag demokrata képviselők, összesen nyolcan haltak meg úgy, hogy még hivatalban voltak, közülük hárman idén.

A 70 éves Sylvester Turner és a 77 éves Raúl Grijalva márciusban, míg a 75 éves Gerry Connolly egy hete hunyt el. 2005 óta 24 demokrata képviselő vagy szenátor halt meg hivatali ideje alatt, a republikánusok közül feleannyian.

A tavalyi év talán egyik legabszurdabb washingtoni sztorija szintén egy idős képviselőt érintett, aki történetesen a republikánus padsorokban ült. A Texas 12-es körzetét hosszú ideje, 1997 óta szolgáló Kay Granger 2023 októberében jelentette be, hogy nem indul újra, rá fél évvel pedig átadta a költségvetési bizottság elnöki tisztségét is. Bár szóltak arról pletykák, hogy demenciával küzdhet, a nívós poszt feladásához nem fűzött indoklást – noha a mandátumát megtartotta. A most 82 éves Granger 2024 júliusában adta le az utolsó szavazatát, ezt követően pedig gyakorlatilag felszívódott. Ez feltűnt egy helyi riporternek, és miután teljesen kiürítve találta a képviselő irodáját, és asszisztenseinek is hűlt helyét találta, végül tavaly decemberben nyert megerősítést:

a papíron még aktív képviselő addigra már csaknem fél éve egy idősek otthonában élt, ahol memóriazavarral küzdőket is ápolnak.

Választói azóta sem kaptak konkrét választ arra, hogy mindezt miért titkolták el, és Granger miért nem mondott le inkább.

Meg kell mászni a szamárlétrát

Visszatérve a demokratákra, a személyes szintű részvétnyilvánítás után politikai szempontból azért váltottak ki belső feszültséget a halálukig hivatalban maradó kollégák, mert az említett Gerry Connolly egy nappal azelőtt halt meg, hogy a képviselőház szavazott volna Donald Trump költségvetési csomagjáról, melyet a republikánus zászlóvivő „egyetlen nagy, gyönyörű törvényjavaslatnak” keresztelt. A tervezet meghosszabbítaná az elnök 2017-es adócsökkentéseit, de visszavágná az élelmiszer-segélyekre és a legszegényebbek állami egészségbiztosítására fordított kiadásokat. Mivel csupán egyetlen egy vokson múlt a tervezet elfogadása,

ha a demokraták nem vesztettek volna el ennyi képviselőt az év eleje óta, akár le is tudták volna szavazni azt,

de ehelyett 215-214 arányban átment az alsóházon. Egyesek arra is felhívták a figyelmet, hogy ennek fényében a demokraták még ha meg is szerezték volna a képviselőházi többséget 2024-ben, az elhunyt öreg párttársaik miatt meglehet, hogy pár hónap leforgása alatt elköszönhettek volna attól.

És nem ez volt az első alkalom, hogy a néhai virginiai képviselő a generációváltásról szóló vita kereszttüzébe került. Az idei ciklus kezdete előtt ugyanis Connolly mellett a nála 40 évvel fiatalabb Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is elindult az alsóház felügyeleti bizottságának rangidős címéért. Az AOC-ként is ismert, népszerű New York-i demokrata a párt balszárnyának talán legkiemelkedőbb alakja, és elsősorban óriási követőbázisára, kommunikációs képességére és kollégáit is kisegítő, összegyűjtött adományaival kampányolt a pozícióért, mely keretében kamerák előtti meghallgatásokon kérhette volna számon a Trump-adminisztráció tagjait.

A frakción belüli szavazást azonban a most 85 éves korábbi házelnök, Nancy Pelosi által is támogatott Connolly nyerte,

aki főleg sok éves tapasztalatát és Virginia demokraták felé billentésében betöltött szerepét hangsúlyozta.

Ő volt az, aki hosszú ideje várt a rangidős posztra

– kommentálta egy demokrata Connolly megválasztását decemberben.

Már ekkoriban köztudott volt, hogy Connollynál nyelőcsőrákot diagnosztizáltak egy hónappal azelőtt, de akkor úgy tűnt, a daganat jól reagált a kezelésre. Április végén azonban a virginiai politikus közölte, betegsége miatt pár hónap után le kell mondania a bizottsági szerepéről, és ez lesz az utolsó kongresszusi ciklusa. Connolly visszavonulása után a szóvivője elmondta, több száz vizsgálatot indított a bizottságban, és büszke teljesítményére. Gerry Connolly május 21-én hunyt el.

Az viszont kétségtelen, hogy a rákkal küzdő Connolly nem igazán verekedte be magát az újságcímlapokra a megszólalásaival vagy interjúival, miközben

a demokrata szavazók rendkívül elégedetlenek azzal, ahogy pártjuk a Trump-adminisztráció lépéseire reagált.

Tízből nyolc demokrata szimpatizáns szerint nagyon fontos lenne, hogy keményen szembeszegüljenek, ha nem értenek egyet Donald Trump politikájával, de a válaszadók csupán negyede vélekedett úgy, hogy politikusaik jól végzik ezen feladatukat. Arról nem is beszélve, hogy a tavaly kudarcot vallott párt megítélése történelmi mélységbe zuhant. A generációváltás mellett kiálló fiatalabb politikusok ezáltal inkább azt hangsúlyozzák, hogy egyes párttársaik nem hajlandók vagy nem képesek hatékonyan felvenni a kesztyűt Trumppal, míg ők igen.

Ez a különbségtétel lényegesnek mondható, hiszen valóban látni olyan demokratákhoz köthető matuzsálemeket, akiket nehéz lenne semmittevéssel vádolni: hozhatjuk példaként a 83 éves Bernie Sanderst, aki a „Harc az oligarchia ellen” nevű kampánykörút keretében járja az országot a potenciális örökösének tartott AOC-vel, de a kendőzetlen szókimondásáról híres Maxine Waters is a 86-ot tapossa, és 2013 óta a pénzügyi szolgáltatási bizottság elsőszámú demokratája.

Mi lehet a megoldás?

A Demokrata Nemzeti Bizottság (DNC) újonnan megválasztott 25 éves alelnökének, David Hoggnak volt egy ötlete, hogy miképp lehetne javítani a párt imidzsén, és fiatal politikusokat az előtérbe helyezni – de ez finoman szólva sem aratott sikert a párton belül. A Hogg által alapított külső kampányszervezet, mely a „Vezetők, akiket megérdemlünk” (Leaders We Deserve) névre hallgat, április közepén bejelentette, 20 millió dollárt fog összegyűjteni fiatal, progresszív előválasztási kihívók támogatására, hogy elinduljanak olyan, biztos demokrata körzeteket képviselő párttársai ellen, akik „elaludtak a volánnál”.

A szenioritásra alapuló politikai kultúránk egy arra vonatkozó mércét hozott létre, hogy ki érdemli meg, hogy itt legyen. Olyan emberekre van szükségünk, akik életkortól függetlenül azért vannak itt, hogy harcoljanak

- jelentette ki Hogg, aki a 2018-as parklandi iskolai lövöldözés túlélőjeként kezdett aktivizmusba. Hogg és egy másik alelnök pozíciója azóta veszélybe került, a megválasztásukat ugyanis procedurális mulasztásokra hivatkozva érvényteleníthetik. Erről júniusban dönt a DNC.

A bejelentés, miszerint a párt egyik vezető tisztviselője – akinek elviekben semlegesnek kellene lennie – hivatalban lévő demokraták ellen pénzelhet előválasztási kampányokat, óriási port kavart, és Ken Martin, a DNC elnöke is rossz szemmel nézte. Nancy Pelosi egykori második emberét, a potenciális célpontnak tekinthető, 85 éves Jim Clyburnt is felháborította Hogg kezdeményezése.

Mit akarnak? Hogy feladjam az életemet?

- csattant fel Clyburn, ami talán összefoglalja az évtizedek óta hatalomban lévő politikusok alapvető hozzáállását a kérdéshez. A dél-karolinai képviselő 2022-ben Pelosival együtt lemondott a vezetői posztjáról, de mandátumát nem adta fel, és egyelőre nem tervez visszavonulni. A páros Biden tavalyi visszaléptetésekor is tanúbizonyságot tett a máig kitartó jelentős befolyásáról.

Hogg ellentmondásos terve mellett egyébként felmerült ötletként, hogy a republikánusokhoz hasonlóan a demokraták is három ciklusra korlátozzák a kongresszusi bizottságok vezetőinek mandátumát, ezzel is megakadályozva, hogy egyeseket évtizedekig ne lehessen „kirobbantani” onnan.

Az elnökséghez hasonlóan az általános kongresszusi mandátumkorlátozás szintén évtizedek óta napirenden az Egyesült Államokban, de rendre megrekedt a javaslat fázisában. Az idén (sokadjára) szintén nyújtottak be erről alkotmánymódosító tervezetet, miszerint

a szenátorokat kettő hatéves, míg az alsóházi képviselőket hat kétéves mandátumra korlátoznák, összesen 12-12 évre.

Az elfogadáshoz azonban kétharmados többségre lenne szükség, ami legutóbb, 1997-ben sem jöt össze. A Pew Research Center alapján az amerikaiak 79%-a támogatja a választott tisztviselők mandátumának korlátozását, míg az egész életre kinevezett legfelsőbb bírók esetén háromnegyedük – utóbbiak esetén egyébként Joe Biden 18 éves szolgálati idő bevezetését vetette fel tavaly, így kétévente jelölnének új főbírákat, minden elnök kettő-kettőt.

A legtöbb elemzés azonban az amerikai politikai rendszer strukturális problémáit hangsúlyozza ki, amikor a washingtoni gerontokrácia megszüntetéséról esik szó. A Vox cikke például kiemeli, hogy a választhatósági életkor egyszerű maximálása valószínűleg nem hozna hathatós változást. Bár az amerikaiak várható élettartama valóban növekedik, az aggastyánok hatalomban maradásának oka inkább annak róható fel, hogy

a kongresszusi választásokon egyre kisebb a verseny:

az országos politikai megosztottság tetőfokára hágásával egyre több választó hűen leszavaz pártja jelöltjére, bárki is legyen az, és csökken a szavazólapukat „megosztók” aránya. Ezenkívül a körzethatárok gyakoribbá váló pártpolitikai célú manipulálása (gerrymandering) szintén aláássa a versenyt. Emellett egyértelműen az inkumbens jelöltek javára lejt a pálya, főleg a dollármilliókat megmozgató adománygyűjtés terén – ezáltal szinte lehetetlen, hogy egy kevésbé ismert párton belüli kihívó fel tudja venni a versenyt egy befolyásos kapcsolatokkal bíró inkumbenssel.

Azaz ha egy kongresszusi képviselőt egyszer megválasztanak egy nem túl billegő körzetben, kis túlzással kijelenthető, hogy ha kedve tartja, élete végéig hivatalban maradhat.

Úgy érződött, hogy könnyebb volt bekerülni a Kongresszusba, mint azt otthagyni. A saját sajtóközleményeink és a körülöttünk lévő emberek meggyőznek minket arról, hogy pótolhatatlanok vagyunk

Elegük lett abból, hogy a liberális, globalista elit az illegális migránsok emberi jogait a biztonság és a polgárok érdekei, a genderidentitást pedig a biológia elé helyezi, miközben Ukrajnában háborúval akarja elérni a békét, a demokráciát pedig az ellenvélemények elhallgattatásával kívánja védeni.

Felidézte, hogy 2024-ben számos választást tartottak a világban. Az európai parlamenti választás eredményeként a Patrióták szövetsége lett Európában a harmadik legerősebb, majd tavaly a francia és az osztrák, idén a német és a portugál választások is a patrióta erők előretörését hozták. Az Egyesült Királyságban ugyan a Munkáspárt aratott érdemtelenül is győzelmet, népszerűségük azonban mára összeomlott – jegyezte meg.

A régi elit reakciója minderre az, hogy megpróbálják semmibe venni szavazók tízmillióit, elutasítják azt az alkalmazkodást a világ változásaihoz, amelyet az európai polgárok követelnek.

Mégis, más konzervatív erőkkel összefogva az Európai Parlamentben lehetséges elérni a változást

Les médias outre-Atlantique ne sont pas du même avis.","Ce nest quun au revoir. Elon Musk, lhomme le plus riche du monde, nest plus conseiller spécial du président américain Donald Trump. Une conférence de presse commune dans le bureau Ovale, vendredi 30 … [+4665 chars]",,"Ce n’est qu’un au revoir. Elon Musk, l’homme le plus riche du monde, n’est plus conseiller spécial du président américain Donald Trump. Une conférence de presse commune dans le bureau Ovale, vendredi 30 mai, a marqué la fin de l’inédite aventure gouvernementale du multimilliardaire, qui a assuré vouloir rester ""l’ami et le conseiller"" du président américain.

Donald Trump a toutefois offert un laissez-passer à Elon Musk, symbolisé par une vraie clé en or de ""24 carats"", déclarant : ""Elon ne partira pas vraiment"". ""Il va faire des allers-retours, je pense, j’ai le sentiment que [Doge est] son ​​bébé"". Outre-Atlantique, la presse américaine s’est largement fait écho de ce départ, alors qu’Elon Musk s’est attelé pendant quatre mois à couper dans les dépenses publiques à travers le Département de l’efficacité gouvernementale (Doge). ""Pour reprendre le jargon de SpaceX (l’entreprise de fabrication d’engins spatiaux de Musk, NDLR), il semblerait que la carrière d’Elon Musk en tant que coprésident de Donald Trump ait connu un 'démantèlement rapide et imprévu'"", ironise la chaîne MSNBC. Sa mission était toutefois conçue comme temporaire depuis le début, son statut d'""employé spécial du gouvernement"" étant limité à 130 jours.

""Pas à la hauteur des prédictions""

Mise en scène oblige à l’ère Trump, Elon Musk était posté debout à côté du président américain, assis pendant près d’une heure. Tout de noir vêtu, le multimilliardaire portait une casquette frappée de l’acronyme ""Doge"", en référence au département qu’il a dirigé, ""qui a réalisé de vastes réductions des coûts qui n’ont pas été à la hauteur de ses prédictions"", souligne The Wall Street Journal. Elon Musk arborait par ailleurs un t-shirt ""The Dogefather"". ""L’homme le plus riche du monde avait promis de réduire les dépenses fédérales de 2 000 milliards de dollars. Mais, selon les calculs approximatifs de son propre site web, il n’a réussi à les réduire que de 175 milliards de dollars. Il n’a pratiquement rien fait"", précise MSNBC, qui tacle un ""échec cuisant"".

Si certains de ces efforts ont été annulés par les tribunaux, Elon Musk a quand même réussi à supprimer des dizaines de milliers d’emplois gouvernementaux, et à réduire la taille de l’Agence américaine pour le développement international (USAID) et celle d’autres ministères — des efforts dont les républicains avaient longtemps parlé, mais qu’ils n’avaient pas pris en compte, indique The Wall Street Journal. ""Il est clair que Musk a causé des dommages réels et substantiels qui seront difficiles à réparer"", insiste encore la chaîne MSNBC.

Un homme d’affaires affaibli

Elon Musk avait annoncé fin avril se mettre en retrait pour s’occuper davantage de ses entreprises, notamment Tesla, dont les ventes ont chuté au fur et à mesure que son patron devenait l’une des personnalités les plus clivantes du monde. Le tourbillon de quatre mois d’Elon Musk s’invitant dans des réunions, les affrontements avec des responsables du cabinet de la Maison-Blanche et le maniement de scies, littérales comme métaphoriques, à Washington ont laissé ses entreprises dans une situation financière affaiblie, commente The Washington Post.

Lorsque Elon Musk est revenu dans le bureau Ovale vendredi, mettant fin à son mandat d'""employé spécial du gouvernement"", sa stature politique, sa réputation et sa fortune personnelle avaient radicalement changé, consent Politico. The Wall Street Journal dresse également le constat d’un homme d’affaires affaibli, écrivant : ""Musk retourne à son empire d’affaires meurtri et avec sa propre réputation ayant souffert"".

Comme très souvent lors de la signature des projets de loi dans le bureau Ovale, l’adieu d’Elon Musk s’est rapidement déplacé vers des sujets sans rapport. Le président Donald Trump a ainsi déclaré que le plafond de la dette était ""catastrophique"" pour le pays et devait être éliminé, disant qu’il ""examinerait les faits"". Elon Musk a par ailleurs balayé les informations du New York Times sur sa consommation de drogues, mais sans y répondre sur le fond. Le journal affirme que pendant la campagne électorale, l’entrepreneur consommait d’importantes quantités de kétamine, un anesthésiant aux effets stimulants, mais aussi de l’ecstasy, des champignons hallucinogènes et des médicaments. Plus tard, quand un journaliste a demandé à Donald Trump s’il était ""au courant de l’usage régulier de drogues par Elon Musk"", le président américain a répondu : ""Je ne l’étais pas"". Avant d’ajouter : ""Je pense qu’Elon est un type fantastique"".

Reste que le républicain semble être le dernier allié de l'intéressé, alors que de nombreux articles de la presse américaine ont révélé que les membres de l’administration ne le supportaient pas, tout comme les Américains, qui selon un sondage publié le 30 mai désapprouvent l’action du milliardaire à 54 %.

«Поскольку Грузия является кандидатом (на вступление в ЕС.— “Ъ”), этот факт используется для давления на нее»,— пояснил господин Кавелашвили в интервью испанской газете El Mundo. Он добавил, что после закулисной просьбы об участии европейские страны стали «провоцировать здесь (в Грузии.— “Ъ”) процессы».

Грузинский президент уточнил, что, отказавшись от поддержки территориальной целостности страны, Евросоюз начал применять двойные стандарты. Речь идет о неправительственных организациях (НПО), которые финансировались Агентством США по международному развитию (USAID) и обладали в Грузии значительными ресурсами. «Через них началось давление. В Грузии у нас была информация о том, что поступают огромные деньги»,— заключил Михаил Кавелашвили.

Ранее служба госбезопасности Грузии сообщала о подготовке насильственной смены власти в стране в 2024 году. По данным ведомства, переворот планировал совершить круг лиц, включая грузинских наемников с Украины. Предлогом для этого, как утверждается, должны были стать закон об иноагентах и обвинения в фальсификации парламентских выборов. Согласно отчету службы, группировка получала иностранное финансирование и управлялась НПО.

Not surprisingly, the crowd-pleasing bits of DOGE agency-wrecking, like the claim that the USAID, particularly its regime change operating, were being shuttered, proved to be abjectly false. As Brian Berletic pointed out, Secretary of State reassured both the House and Senate early on that those operations would be moved into the Department of State. Further corroboration came via the restoration of nearly all National Endowment for Democracy funding.

But the whackage that harms the lives of ordinary Americans continues apace, and with unseemly enthusiasm. Cruelty towards the poors and destruction of the pillars of American leadership in the sciences and academia is the order of the day. This is Pol Pottery without the killing fields.

Critics of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency cautioned Friday against undue elation or complacency over Elon Musk stepping down as de facto DOGE chief, warning that officials at the contentious agency are pressing ahead with U.S. President Donald Trump’s mission of eviscerating key agencies and the ability of the federal government to properly function.

With Musk’s official departure from DOGE this week—returning to the private sector to run his beleaguered business empire—most of the agency’s leadership and rank-and-file staff remain in place. As the Revolving Door Project (RDP) noted Friday, key DOGE officials “maintain extensive ties to Musk’s corporate empire, with many of them having come to DOGE directly from one of Musk’s companies.”

According to RDP research, “at least 46 former or current DOGE members have substantial and direct ties to Elon Musk.”

“DOGE isn’t going anywhere, according to the Trump administration’s own officials,” RDP said. The watchdog group warned specifically about Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought, who they said “seems to be the new boss in town.”

The visions of the two men, said RDP, “have been aligned from the start. Musk endorsed Vought’s view of the unconstitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act and said that DOGE would work ‘closely with [OMB].'”

Vought co-authored the policy portion of Project 2025, a far-right blueprint for gutting the government and expanding executive power.

“There is no daylight between Elon Musk and Russ Vought on the aim of greenlighting corporate abuse, as anyone can see from their joint destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,” RDP executive director Jeff Hauser said Friday. “DOGE’s Musk-tied staffers have already burrowed into the government, and having a new boss who has coordinated extensively with Musk isn’t likely to change their actual actions much at all.”

“Musk’s departure obscures but does not actually change the continuity of DOGE’s staff and mission to destroy everything that protects the public from the depredations of the most rapacious oligarchs,” Hauser added.

Another watchdog, Accountable.US, noted Friday that Vought “has a nearly 20-year record working on Republican efforts to cut Social Security and Medicare—including overseeing numerous Trump budget proposals.”

“It’s proof that DOGE’s extreme agenda, which is causing ordinary families to fall behind, is full steam ahead as Trump and his allies in Congress push forward deep cuts to Americans’ essential benefits,” the group continued. “Last week, congressional Republicans advanced the largest cuts to Medicaid and [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] in history, which would result in 14 million Americans losing health coverage, 3 million households without food assistance, and an increased burden for millions with higher education and energy costs. All while adding over $4 trillion to the deficit.”

“Americans deserve real government reforms to cut red tape, eliminate waste, and ensure taxpayers are able to access the services they pay for,” Accountable.US added. “That was never DOGE’s goal. Instead Trump and Musk tried to gutMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, to line their own pockets and those of their billionaire friends with tax cuts, and the administration is only just getting started.”

As one staffer at the DOGE-beset National Institutes of Health told Politico, “DOGE is still hungry. We’ve still got to feed the fucking dog.”

Trump and Musk are on an unconstitutional rampage, aiming for virtually every corner of the federal government. These two right-wing billionaires are targeting nurses, scientists, teachers, daycare providers, judges, veterans, air traffic controllers, and nuclear safety inspectors. No one is safe. The food stamps program, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are next.

It’s an unprecedented disaster and a five-alarm fire, but there will be a reckoning. The people did not vote for this. The American people do not want this dystopian hellscape that hides behind claims of “efficiency.” Still, in reality, it is all a giveaway to corporate interests and the libertarian dreams of far-right oligarchs like Musk.",2025-05-31 10:07:45+00:00,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/05/musk-might-be-gone-but-watchdogs-warn-trump-doge-carnage-will-continue.html,

Except there he was in the Oval Office on Friday, in a press availability alongside President Donald Trump. Sporting a black eye — given to him by his 5-year-old, he said — Musk grumbled about his time in the nation’s capital. “We became essentially the DOGE bogeyman,” Musk said. “It just became a bit ridiculous.”

That complaint echoed similar comments in his media tour preceding that appearance, as Musk whined about his DOGE stint not turning out quite as triumphantly as he had hoped. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything.” Not only that, “People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That’s really uncool.”

Musk didn’t know how things worked, wasn’t interested in learning and didn’t care how many people he would hurt.

In other words, his noble effort at reform was undone by the deep state, and all he got for it was a heap of criticism and slumping sales for his car company. Won’t somebody pity the billionaire?

Musk has teams of acolytes around him who will no doubt be eager to reassure him that if some people in Washington don’t adore him, that just means they didn’t deserve him in the first place. But in truth, Musk’s feelings are irrelevant; what matters is the chaos he brought to the federal government that serves all of us, and the deaths he is at least partly responsible for around the world. The malignancy that is his Department of Government Efficiency project lives on, not only in the cadre of incompetents he has left behind in Washington, but in the spirit of gleeful destruction ever more firmly incorporated into Republican ideology.

Musk’s time in Washington was characterized by a toxic combination of ignorance, arrogance and malevolence. He didn’t know how things worked, wasn’t interested in learning and didn’t care how many people he would hurt. All of it stemmed from his belief that not only is government incapable of doing anything right, almost everything it tries to do isn’t worth doing anyway. So if he had an impression that an agency was bad — say, the U.S. Agency for International Development — what would be the point of learning its goals and methods? Just shut the whole thing down.

The demise of USAID is one of the most horrific legacies of Musk’s time in Washington. The abrupt cutoff of food aid to vulnerable people around the world “has destabilized some of the most fragile locations in the world and thrown refugee camps further into unrest,” according to internal State Department documents obtained by ProPublica. The withdrawal of medical assistance — especially through PEPFAR, the spectacularly successful U.S. program that fights the spread of HIV in Africa — is already leading directly to people’s deaths, almost certainly by the thousands. Some studies have concluded that hundreds of thousands of people either have died or will die because the U.S. government, at Musk’s urging, has all but shut down its foreign humanitarian efforts.

The experience of USAID was repeated in agency after agency, often at Musk’s whims or to serve Musk’s interest. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which used to protect Americans from financial scams, could cause problems for Musk’s plans to add payment services to his social media platform X. But now CFPB staff have been sent home, and the agency has essentially ceased to function.

Even if Musk and some his top lieutenants are gone, their underlings are still in the federal government.

We saw a pattern repeated over and over: Musk’s DOGE staffers would descend on a government office, demand access to critical systems and start destroying programs they didn’t bother to understand. Officials who stood up to them were fired. Contracts were canceled, offices were closed, and people who relied on services were abandoned.

That damage can’t easily be undone, and even if Musk and some his top lieutenants are gone, their underlings are still in the federal government. And while the shock of what DOGE was doing may have been appalling to most of us, to Republicans in both the executive branch and Congress, it was thrilling (though Republicans on Capitol Hill have been less thrilled about formalizing DOGE’s cuts into law). They’ve now assimilated Musk’s ethos as their own: break everything you can see, fire as many committed employees as possible, don’t worry about consequences to people’s lives, and if what you’re doing is illegal, well, maybe the courts will sort that out later.

And no, Musk was never going to cut $2 trillion from the budget; the fact that he thought he could just showed how clueless he was. But his contempt for the government and the public servants who work in it was obvious from the outset. He wanted indiscriminate destruction, and he got it.

Now he claims to be peeved that the Republican megabill doesn’t reduce the deficit, as though that was ever something the GOP cared about. If he’s really concerned, perhaps he should use some of his billions to lobby for tax increases on the wealthy.

For all his complaints, Musk is getting most of what he really wanted. His time in the government coincided with the Trump administration shutting down many investigations Musk faced over his labor and environmental practices. The administration is also moving to direct billions of dollars in funding meant for rural broadband to his satellite company, and Trump’s new idea for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system looks like a contracting gravy train with Musk’s companies in the front car.

So why isn’t Musk happy? The answer isn’t that he didn’t succeed, because in most ways he did. What upsets him is this: He didn’t just want to lay waste to the government and enrich himself. He wanted to do that and then have us thank him for it.

Tell that to a mother watching her child die from malnourishment, or a skilled park ranger who got fired from their dream job, or someone in tornado alley who can’t get updated weather forecasts, or AIDS patients who no longer have lifesaving medication. I’m sure they’ll be very sympathetic.",2025-05-31 10:00:00+00:00,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-leaves-doge-trump-legacy-rcna209823,

When Mr Trump took office earlier this year, DOGE, led by Mr Musk, was set up to cut wasteful spending in the US government.

The Trump administration has moved to cut funding to government foreign aid agency USAID and other global initiatives, including the United States President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR), which has saved more than 25 million lives since it was established in 2003.

During an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Bono told host Joe Rogan of how the world’s relationship with the US seems to be changing, and revealed he is in contact with US secretary of state Marco Rubio.

“I think America's more vulnerable now than it's ever been. It feels like America's fallen out of love with the rest of the world. I don't think the world wants to fall out of love with America,” he said

He then cited a report estimating 300,000 people have already died as a result of cuts made to USAID funding and said food intended for foreign aid is being left to rot because the workers who had access to it have been fired.

""There's food rotting in boats, in warehouses. There is - this will f**k you off - you will not be happy, no American will, but there is, I think it's 50,000 tonnes of food that are stored in Djibouti, South Africa, Dubai and - wait for it - Houston, Texas.

""And that is rotting rather than going to Gaza, rather than going to Sudan, because the people who know the codes for the warehouse are fired, they're gone. What is that? That's not America, is it?""

Mr Rogan agreed there ""have been organisations that do tremendous good all throughout the world"" but added there was ""a money laundering operation"" with no oversight that saw billions or trillions of dollars of US public money go missing.

The levels of waste, abuse and fraud in the US government claimed by Mr Trump and Mr Musk have been disputed by fact checkers in the American and international media.

Mr Musk has responded to the claims made by Bono in a post on his social media platform X: “He’s such a liar/idiot. Zero people have died!” he wrote.

During his conversation with Mr Rogan, Bono said a Christian aid organisation working with malnourished children is being forced to “choose which child to pull off the IVs” because of funding cuts.

""It just seems to me like a kind of, I don’t know if evil is a strong word, too strong a word, but what we know about pure evil is it rejoices in the deaths, the squandering of human life, particularly children’s.

""It actually rejoices in it and whether it’s incompetence, whether it’s unintended consequences, it’s not too late for people.”

Bono said he is contact with Mr Rubio, who does not agree people are dying as a result of cuts to funding.

""I have conversations with Marco Rubio. He’s convinced people aren’t dying yet. I don’t know who’s telling him, or not telling him, rather. But his instincts are correct.”

He said Mr Rubio used to wear an armband for the One Campaign, the organisation co-founded by Bono in 2004 for providing aid in Africa.

A pesar de varias rondas de encuentros mediados por Omán, hasta el momento no ha habido resultados concretos que puedan apuntar a una limitación del desarrollo nuclear iraní, ni al fin de las sanciones económicas implementadas por EU y diversas naciones de Occidente. En ese escenario flota la amenaza de un ataque militar de Israel contra su acérrimo enemigo de Teherán, aun cuando el presidente Trump se opone, al menos por ahora, a ello.

Irán constituye a nivel global un desafío, ya que sus objetivos derivan de un régimen cuya naturaleza teocrática lo impulsa a la expansión del imperio de su doctrina religiosa basada en la interpretación islámica chiita a la que se apega. En esa empresa de carácter mesiánico casi todo es válido, incluso la utilización de métodos abiertamente terroristas contra quienes son vistos como un obstáculo para el avance de su misión sagrada.

Dentro de ese proyecto de expansión, le ha sido importante al régimen de los ayatolas contar con aliados temporales capaces de brindarle alivio ante las sanciones que lo agobian cada vez más, lo mismo que puntos geográficos de apoyo para conseguir presencia e influencia en regiones de las que está alejado físicamente pero que le pueden servir de puentes para instrumentar la exportación de su revolución islamista. Así es como ha tejido nexos importantes de carácter económico y militar en América Latina con gobiernos de países como Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua y Bolivia, con quienes tiene en común el perfil autocrático y represivo, además de coincidir en su intensa hostilidad contra EU, vigente desde aquel lejano 1979 cuando se fundó la República Islámica tras el derrocamiento del régimen del sha Reza Pahlevi.

En la actualidad, la mira del gobierno iraní también se está dirigiendo al continente africano. Sobre todo en estos últimos tiempos en que países de Occidente que habían estado presentes en África por décadas decidieron abandonarlo debido a consideraciones políticas diversas. Francia y EU han emprendido una retirada de la región que está siendo aprovechada por Rusia, China e Irán. Es así como el mes pasado Irán recibió a 700 hombres de negocios de 38 naciones africanas, como parte de la tercera Conferencia Irán-África, a la que también asistieron los embajadores africanos destacados en Teherán. El ambiente de la reunión reflejó intenciones serias de profundizar todo tipo de relaciones.

Y es que Irán está trabajando arduamente para expandir su presencia en el Cuerno de África, lo mismo que en la región norafricana y en el Sahel. Para ello cuenta con nexos con poblaciones chiitas locales en África Occidental. Sudáfrica, Zimbabue, Tanzania y Kenia se han vuelto sus socios en una diversidad de áreas, al tiempo que Etiopía, que vive desde hace tiempo una guerra civil, le compra a Teherán drones UAV, similares a los vendidos a Rusia para su guerra contra Ucrania.

En contraste, EU se aleja cada vez más del continente africano, el cual se ve ahora amenazado por crisis severas en temas como el de la salud, en vista de la decisión de Trump de recortar casi totalmente los fondos que tradicionalmente se enviaban a través de los programas de USAID. El África subsahariana ha sido la segunda región del mundo en cuanto al monto de ayuda recibida a través de ese organismo (12.7 billones de dólares en 2024). De ahí el cálculo hecho por los Centros de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de África de que aproximadamente 4 millones de personas pueden morir a causa de enfermedades tratables debido a la falta de recursos. Por dar tan sólo otro ejemplo más, el recorte a los fondos para los programas de VIH/sida en Sudáfrica puede implicar 500 mil muertes durante la próxima década.

Trump firmó esa orden ejecutiva bajo la justificación de que el mundo ha estado abusando de la generosidad de las arcas estadunidenses. Al parecer no se da cuenta de que sus decisiones están desembocando no sólo en la incubación de monumentales tragedias humanitarias, sino que están poniéndole en bandeja de plata a regímenes, como el iraní, la posibilidad de ocupar el vacío. Por un lado, presume de la inteligencia de sus políticas para contener las ambiciones de expansión iraní, y por el otro, al parecer sin siquiera percatarse, está abriendo la puerta a que, de manera sutil o no tan sutil, los intereses del islam radical chiita, propios de Irán, se adueñen de la cancha.",2025-05-31 08:53:00+00:00,https://www.excelsior.com.mx/opinion/esther-shabot/africa-sale-eu-entra-iran/1718950,

Αυτό αποκαλύπτει σε αποκλειστικό ρεπορτάζ της η Wall Street Journal. Η απορία αυτή, σύμφωνα με αξιωματούχους της κυβέρνησης που μίλησαν στην εφημερίδα, αντικατοπτρίζει τις εκρήξεις σκεπτικισμού και απογοήτευσης που επικρατούσαν στον Λευκό Οίκο κατά τη διάρκεια της ταραχώδους τετράμηνης θητείας του Μασκ στη δημόσια διοίκηση.

Από τη Μέση Ανατολή ως τις συνεδριάσεις του υπουργικού συμβουλίου και το Οβάλ Γραφείο, η ένταση ξεχείλιζε — και δεν ήταν μόνο οι προστριβές. Ήταν και τα εμπόδια: δικαστικές προσφυγές, γραφειοκρατικές καθυστερήσεις, και μια αίσθηση γενικής εξάντλησης.

Ο Τραμπ συνεχίζει να τρέφει προσωπική συμπάθεια για τον Μασκ — δείπνησαν μαζί την προηγούμενη εβδομάδα — και του οργάνωσε αποχαιρετιστήρια συνάντηση την Παρασκευή στο Οβάλ Γραφείο, όπου αντάλλαξαν φιλοφρονήσεις.

«Ο Έλον δεν φεύγει πραγματικά», είπε ο Τραμπ. «Θα πηγαινοέρχεται.»

50% ιδιοφυΐα, 50% παιδί

«Ο Μασκ είναι 50% ιδιοφυΐα, 50% παιδί», φέρεται να έχει πει ο Τραμπ σε συνεργάτες του. Άλλες φορές τον αποκαλεί «90% ιδιοφυΐα, 10% παιδί». Οι δυο τους είχαν ατελείωτες, εκκεντρικές συζητήσεις στα δείπνα του Μαρ-α-Λάγκο, αλλά συχνά ο Μασκ μπέρδευε τον πρόεδρο με το ιδιόρρυθμο χιούμορ του.

Πλέον, ο Μασκ τελείωσε με το DOGE — την υπηρεσία που ισχυρίζεται ότι εξοικονόμησε 170 δισ. δολάρια με επιθετικές περικοπές. Πέτυχε όντως όσα υποσχέθηκε;

Οι υποστηρικτές του λένε πως ναι: μείωσε τη διεθνή βοήθεια, έκοψε θέσεις εργασίας, άσκησε πίεση για αλλαγές που άλλοι δεν τολμούσαν.

Όμως ο τρόπος με τον οποίο έφυγε — μέσω ανάρτησης στα social media, χωρίς να έχει ενημερώσει ακριβώς πότε — ενόχλησε τον Λευκό Οίκο. Παρότι ο Τραμπ γνώριζε ότι έρχεται η αποχώρηση, δεν ήξερε το ακριβές χρονοδιάγραμμα.

Έκρηξη από το πουθενά: Η σύγκρουση για τον Όλτμαν

Το τελευταίο ξέσπασμα έγινε 11.000 χιλιόμετρα μακριά από την Ουάσιγκτον. Ο Μασκ εξοργίστηκε με συμφωνία που παρουσίασε ο ανταγωνιστής του, Σαμ Όλτμαν της OpenAI, κατά τη διάρκεια προεδρικής επίσκεψης στο εξωτερικό. Διαμαρτυρήθηκε σε τρεις αξιωματούχους, οι οποίοι εμπλοκήραν και τον Τραμπ. Τελικά, η ανακοίνωση καθυστέρησε μια εβδομάδα και ο Όλτμαν αποσύρθηκε από την κοινή εμφάνιση με τον πρόεδρο.

Στο μεταξύ, ο ίδιος ο Μασκ δεχόταν πίεση: οι πωλήσεις της Tesla κατέρρευσαν, τα κέρδη υποχώρησαν 71% στο πρώτο τρίμηνο και μια ρουκέτα της SpaceX εξερράγη.

«Πρέπει να τραβήξω τη φωτιά από πάνω μου και τις εταιρείες μου», φέρεται να είπε σε αξιωματούχους.

Σε υπουργικό συμβούλιο, ο Μασκ σηκώθηκε και ξέσπασε: «Δεν έχετε ιδέα τι ζημιά προκαλείται στα αυτοκίνητά μου και πόσο δύσκολη είναι η κατάσταση», είπε — παγώνοντας την αίθουσα. Η υπουργός Δικαιοσύνης Παμ Μπόντι του απάντησε πως θα συλλάβει «όποιον εγκληματία βρει».

Ο Μασκ διαβεβαίωσε ότι θα συνεχίσει να στηρίζει πολιτικά τον Τραμπ, αλλά οι συνεργάτες του προέδρου παρατηρούν πως η επιταγή των 100 εκατ. που είχε υποσχεθεί στο πολιτικό PAC του Τραμπ… δεν έχει φτάσει.

Αντιθέτως, κατηγορούσε αρκετούς στον Λευκό Οίκο ότι δεν έχουν την ίδια αποφασιστικότητα να αλλάξουν την Ουάσιγκτον όπως εκείνος.

Αναστάτωση, αλαζονεία και το «βαρύ χέρι» του Μασκ

Από τις πρώτες ημέρες, ο Μασκ κινούνταν εκτός πλαισίου: έδινε εντολές για απολύσεις, ζητούσε ευαίσθητα δεδομένα χωρίς να ενημερώσει τον Λευκό Οίκο, συγκρούστηκε με την επικεφαλής προσωπικού Σούζι Γουάιλς και επέμενε ότι το DOGE δεν έπρεπε να δέχεται έλεγχο για τις προσλήψεις του.

Ο Τραμπ επενέβη, ζητώντας από τη Γουάιλς να τον εποπτεύει στενότερα. Σταδιακά, ο Μασκ συμφώνησε να συναντιούνται τακτικά.

Όμως οι εντάσεις δεν υποχώρησαν. Όταν αποκάλεσε τον γερουσιαστή Τοντ Γιανγκ «πιόνι του βαθέος κράτους», ο Τραμπ εξοργίστηκε: οι συνεργάτες του είχαν πείσει τον Γιανγκ να υποστηρίξει την Τουλσί Γκάμπαρντ για επικεφαλής των μυστικών υπηρεσιών. Ο αντιπρόεδρος Τζέι-Ντι Βανς κάλεσε τον Μασκ για να «μαζέψει» την ανάρτηση — και εκείνος την κατέβασε. Αλλά η ζημιά είχε γίνει.

Ο Λευκός Οίκος απογοητεύτηκε και με την ανάμειξη του Μασκ στις εκλογές για το Ανώτατο Δικαστήριο του Γουισκόνσιν. Ο εκλεκτός του, Μπραντ Σίμελ, θεωρούνταν ακατάλληλος. Ο Τραμπ έκανε ακόμη και town hall μαζί του, αλλά μετά είπε στους συμβούλους του: «Τελείωσα με αυτόν». Ο Σίμελ ηττήθηκε πανηγυρικά.

«Πιο ηλίθιος κι από σακί τούβλα»: Ο Μασκ και οι υπουργοί

Η συμπεριφορά του Μασκ προς υπουργούς προκαλούσε αμηχανία. Αποκάλεσε δημόσια τον Πίτερ Ναβάρο «ηλίθιο» και «πιο χαζό κι από σακί τούβλα». Οι αξιωματούχοι έλεγαν πως ο Τραμπ έμεινε έκπληκτος με την επιθετικότητα του Μασκ σε υπουργικό συμβούλιο.

Η δε στενή του συνεργάτις, Κέιτι Μίλερ, είχε γίνει κόκκινο πανί: «μιλούσε εκ μέρους του Μασκ για τα πάντα», λένε συνεργάτες του προέδρου. Ο Μασκ έκανε στενή παρέα με το ζεύγος Στίβεν και Κέιτι Μίλερ.

Ο ΥΠΕΞ Μάρκο Ρούμπιο απαίτησε να έχει τον έλεγχο της USAID μετά από ξαφνικές περικοπές. Ο υπουργός Μεταφορών Σον Ντάφι συγκρούστηκε με τον Μασκ για τους ελεγκτές εναέριας κυκλοφορίας.

«Απελευθέρωση» με δασμούς και διαρροές

Ο Μασκ εξοργίστηκε με τους νέους δασμούς του Τραμπ για την «Ημέρα Απελευθέρωσης». Κάλεσε επιχειρηματίες και αξιωματούχους να παρέμβουν στον πρόεδρο και χαρακτήρισε τους δασμούς «καταστροφή». Ο Τραμπ δεν άλλαξε γνώμη.

Έγινε έξαλλος όταν έμαθε πως ο Μασκ είχε ενημέρωση στο Πεντάγωνο για την Κίνα, θεωρώντας πως υπήρχε σύγκρουση συμφερόντων λόγω των συμβολαίων του με τη SpaceX.

Ο Μασκ συνέχισε να κάνει περικοπές σε υπουργεία — ακόμα και στην Υγεία — και να επιτίθεται στον νέο φορολογικό νόμο. Ο Τραμπ δεν ενόχλησε τόσο, αλλά οι συνεργάτες του αγανάκτησαν.

Το τέλος: λιγότερες εμφανίσεις, ένα μελανιασμένο μάτι και μια δήλωση

Στο τέλος, ο Μασκ επισκεπτόταν τον Λευκό Οίκο αραιά. Από καθημερινές παρουσίες, είχε μειώσει τις εμφανίσεις σε τρεις φορές την εβδομάδα — κι αυτές, προς το τέλος, σχεδόν εξαφανίστηκαν.

Την Παρασκευή, στο Οβάλ Γραφείο, στάθηκε δίπλα στον Τραμπ, με τα χέρια σταυρωμένα και έναν μελανιασμένο κύκλο κάτω από το μάτι.

Bár a világ leggazdagabb emberének Washingtonból való távozása már hetek óta lógott a levegőben, mégis egy ellentmondásos korszak lezárásának tekinthetjük azt, a kormányzati hatékonysági hivatal (DOGE) okozta felfordulás ugyanis Donald Trump második elnökségének egyik legmeghatározóbb emléke lesz – még úgy is, hogy a DOGE hivatalosan folytatja a munkát. Az amerikai sajtóban számos indokról olvashatunk, hogy miért döntött a Tesla-vezér végül a távozás mellett, ám talán az a legjelentősebb mind közül, hogy Musknak szembesülnie kellett a ténnyel, miszerint a túlontúl nagyravágyó és drasztikus ígéreteit nem fogja tudni egy karikacsapásra megvalósítani, és az üzleti világban szerzett tapasztalatát mégsem olyan könnyű politikai, illetve kormányzati sikerekre váltani.

Ahogy a kormány különleges alkalmazottjaként tervezett időm a végéhez közeledik, szeretném megköszönni Donald Trump elnök úrnak a lehetőséget, hogy csökkenthettem a pazarló kiadásokat. A DOGE küldetése csak erősödni fog idővel, ahogy az életvitelszerűvé válik az egész kormányzatban

- jelentette be Elon Musk az általa tulajdonolt X közösségi platformon magyar idő szerint csütörtök hajnalban. A Reutersszel a Fehér Ház egyik tisztviselője akkor azt közölte, a milliárdos különösebb pompát vagy nyilvános elbúcsúzást mellőző ""leszerelése"" azonnal kezdetét veszi, amiről Donald Trumppal sem egyeztetett hivatalosan. A tisztviselő szerint a dél-afrikai születésű üzletember távozásáról ""vezetői szinten"" döntöttek.

As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government. @realDonaldTrump — Elon (Musk) May 29, 2025

(Musk közben pénteken az Ovális Irodában nyilatkozott a sajtó munkatársainak, ahol Trump kijelentette, a techmogul ""nem távozik valójában"", és nem hivatalos tanácsadóként továbbra is segíteni fogja.)

A világ leggazdagabb embere finoman szólva is viharos pár hónapot tudhat maga mögött.

Musk a Trump ellen Pennsylvaniában megkísérelt merénylet után állt be nyilvánosan a republikánus zászlóvivő mögé, októberben pedig a merénylet helyszínén állt – mi több, ugrott – színpadra az elnökjelölt melletti lelkesedését kifejezve, akinek a kampányát körülbelül 288 millió dollárral tolta meg, ezzel pedig Amerika elsőszámú egyéni donorává lépett elő. Musk már Trump beiktatásának napján ellentmondásba keveredett, miután beszédekor egy olyan gesztust tett, amelyet kritikusai náci karlendítésként értelmeztek. Musk propagandának nevezte a vádat. Hasonlóan emlékezetes és vitatott pillanat volt, amikor a Fehér Ház felhajtója átmenetileg Tesla-autókereskedéssé változott, és az amerikai elnök ajánlott elektromos járműveket megvételre.

Trump kezdetben tanácsadó testületként hozta létre a kormányzati hatékonysági hivatalt (Department of Government Efficiency; DOGE), mely élére Musk mellett Vivek Ramaswamyt üzletembert és volt elnökjelölt-aspiránst nevezte ki. Utóbbi azonban még a munka megkezdése előtt kiszállt, állítólag a Muskkal kialakult személyes ellentétek miatt. Musk február 20-én még egy piros láncfűrészt is átvehetett Javier Milei argentin elnöktől a CPAC színpadán.

Többe került az egész, mint amennyit spóroltak?

Musk tizenéves mérnököket is tartalmazó csapata rögvest munkához látott a ""gyorsan lépj, és törj össze dolgokat"" elv jegyében. Rengeteg kormányzati hivatalba és azok szervereibe behatoltak, több ügynökséget – köztük a Pénzügyi Fogyasztóvédelmi Irodát (CFPB), a Voice of America (VOA) műsorszórót, és a Nemzetközi Fejlesztési Ügynökség (USAID) – pedig lényegében egyik napról a másikra felszámolták, bár kérdéses, volt-e erre törvényi felhatalmazásuk.

A New York Times összesítése alapján közel 60 ezer embertől vált meg az összesen 2,4 milliós szövetségi államapparátus (bár a kirúgások egy részét pereskedés miatt felfüggesztették), 76 ezren önkéntesen távoztak, és további 150 ezer elbocsátás van tervben – azaz a munkaerő 12%-a lehet érintett. A kaotikus és meggondolatlan fellépés következtében viszont 24 ezer alkalmazottat vissza kellett vennie az adminisztrációnak: az agrárminisztériumnál például 6 ezer embert kellett visszavenni (köztük a madárinfluenza terjedésének megakadályozásáért felelős szakértőket), de nem sikerült mindenkit visszaédesgetni a közszolgálatba, ami munkaerőhiányhoz vezetett.

Eddig összesen legalább 31 bírósági per indult a DOGE pár hónapos tevékenysége miatt,

például több ezer köztisztviselő jogellenes elbocsátása vagy állami adatbázisokhoz való jogszerűtlen hozzáférés miatt. Mindeközben egyébként Musk pozíciója is jogi csatározások tárgyává vált, hiszen hivatalosan nem ő vezette a DOGE-ot, hanem egy bizonyos Amy Gleason, aki szerint Musk még csak nem is dolgozott a kormányzati szervnél, és sem ő nem jelent Musknak, sem fordítva. Trump ugyanakkor újra és újra kitartott amellett, hogy igenis a SpaceX-alapító a DOGE vezére.

Musk a tavalyi kampányban kezdetben 2 ezermilliárd dolláros kiadáscsökkentést ígért,

ami a szövetségi kormányzat 6,7 ezermilliárd dolláros büdzséjének harmadával ért volna fel. Az éves célösszeget aztán 1 ezermillárd dollárra módosította, végül egy áprilisi kabinetülésen arról beszélt, hogy

2026-ban a pazarlás és csalás csökkentéséből 150 milliárd dolláros megtakarítást várunk.

Ez az eredeti cél 0,0075%-ának felel meg.

A teljes átláthatóságot ígérő DOGE honlapja jelenleg ennél számottevőbb, 175 milliárd dollárnyi spórolásról ad számot,

ám a sajtóban megjelent elemzések alapján ezt nem feltétlenül érdemes készpénznek venni.

Mint arról a Portfolio-n is olvashattak, számos példa akadt arra, hogy a DOGE-csapat alaptalanul vagy hibásan jegyzett fel felmondott kormányzati szerződéseket, illetve többször tüntette fel ugyanazt vagy félreszámolt bizonyos összegeket. Egyszóval továbbra sem tudni, hogy a DOGE mennyit spórolt összesen az amerikai államigazgatás ""hatékonyabbá tételével"".

Ráadásul a Partnership for Public Service nevű amerikai nonprofit úgy számol,

MUsk kiadáscsökkentési intézkedései csak idén 135 milliárd dollárba fognak fájni az államnak,

mivel fizetett szabadságra küldtek rengeteg munkavállalót, többeket újra fel kellett venni, másokat pedig át kell képezni. Ebben az összegben nincs benne a DOGE miatt keletkezett perköltség, és az a 300 milliárd dollár fölé becsült állami bevételelmaradás sem, ami az adóhivatal 40%-os tervezett leépítése miatt keletkezhet.

Csapaton belül sem volt töretlen a siker

Az ellentmondásokba ütköző DOGE működését Trump kormányán belül sem értékelte mindenki. Március elején például a New York Times arról írt, hogy az egyik kormányülésen a DOGE-vezér Marco Rubio külügyminiszterrel és Sean Duffy közlekedési tárcavezetővel is összeszólalkozott. Rubiót – akivel a USAID bezárása miatt már összeütközött – azzal vádolta, hogy nem bocsátott el eleget a beosztottjai közül; míg a több légikatasztrófával is szembesülő Duffyval a légiforgalmi irányítók leépítése miatt különbözött össze. De a területért felelős Doug Collins szintén óvatosságra intett a veteránokat sújtó lépések kapcsán. Az ellentéteket elsimítandó,

Trump akkor kijelentette, „balta” helyett ezentúl „szikével” fogják végrehajtani a leépítéseket,

és biztosította a minisztereit afelől, hogy övék a tárcájuk feletti irányítás.

Áprilisban aztán Scott Bessent pénzügyminiszterrel keveredett ordibálásig fajuló nézeteltérésbe a Fehér Házban, mivel mást szerettek volna látni az adóhivatal (IRS) élén. A tudósítások szerint Bessent azt vágta Musk fejéhez, hogy valószerűtlen ígéreteket tett és alulteljesített a költségcsökkentési programjával,

mire Musk válaszul ""Soros-ügynöknek"" nevezte a korábbi wall street-i befektetőt,

aki szerinte egy ""bukott hedge fund"" élén állt. A pénzügyminiszter egy ponton azt kiabálta az X tulajdonosának, hogy

b---ódj meg!

Erre Musk állítólag úgy reagált, ""mondd hangosabban!"". Egy szemtanú szerint úgy tűnt, mintha a két üzletember azt hitte volna, hogy a pankrátorligában lennének, az elharapódzó konfliktust pedig állítólag az éppen az amerikai elnökkel tárgyaló olasz miniszterelnök, Giorgia Meloni is hallhatta. Másnap egyébként Bessent került ki győztesen a vitából, az ő jelöltje került az IRS élére.

Musk és Trump kapcsolata állítólag a távozásával sem romlott meg, bár a Times szerint eltávolódtak egymástól az év elejéhez képest, amikor Musk a first lady posztjára hajazva ""első havernak"" nevezte magát, alig lehetett kirobbantani a Fehér Ház irodakomplexumából, és egy közös interjúban dicsérték egymást a Fox News adásában.

Az elnökhöz közel álló források szerint Trump számára az jelentette az első ""törést"",

amikor március végén a New York Timesból tudta meg, hogy a Kínában jelentős gazdasági érdekekkel rendelkező Muskot arról készül tájékoztatni a Pentagon, az Egyesült Államok hogyan vívna meg egy esetleges háborút a távol-keleti nagyhatalommal szemben. Trump méltatlankodott, hisz korábban elhessegette a Musk összeférhetetlenségét firtató kérdéseket.

Ott voltak a jelek

Jóllehet a DOGE missziója a tervek szerint 2026. július 4-én, az Egyesült Államok alapításának 250. évfordulóján jár le, a Politico legelőször április elején adott hírt arról, hogy Trump azt közölte belső körével, Musk hamarosan hátrébb lép a kormányzati feladataitól. Az értesülés pár nappal a wisconsini legfelsőbb bírósági választás után érkezett, amely során Musk 25 millió dollárt költött a konzervatív jelölt támogatására.

Végül a techmogul beavatkozása ellenére a liberális jelölt diadalmaskodott 55-45% arányban,

ami állítólag Muskot is rendkívül bosszantotta. A Republikánus Párton belül mindeközben arról indult meg a vita, hogy Musk segítség helyett inkább terhet jelenthet-e a számukra.

Az üzletember ugyanis még Donald Trumpnál is megosztóbb figurává nőtte ki magát,

a Nate Silver adatguru összegzésében szereplő felmérések szerint a januári -5%-os szintről -14-re süllyedt a nettó megítélése az amerikaiak körében. Erről tanúskodtak azok a tüntetések és megmozdulások is, amelyek a demokraták bokszzsákjává vált és ""társelnöknek"" titulált Musk ellen zajlottak.

De nemcsak Musk népszerűsége szenvedte meg a politikai pályafutását. Ha az autókereskedéseket és magukat a járműveket sújtó vandalizmus és egyéb bűncselekmények nem lett volna elég, a Tesla nyeresége 71 százalékkal esett vissza az idei év első negyedévében, a vállalat forgalma pedig jelentősen csökkent. Miközben Musk április végén jelezte, hogy ezentúl több figyelmet fog szentelni a küszködő Teslára, az X-en közzétett posztjai is más irányt vettek: április elejétől fogva sokkal kevesebbet posztolt belpolitikai témában, és ismét a saját cégei kerültek az online aktivitása középpontjába.

A Katari Gazdasági Fórumon interjút adó techmilliárdos múlt héten aztán újabb jelét adta annak, hogy hátrébb lép a politikától: arra a kérdésre, hogy mennyit tervez költeni a 2026-os amerikai kongresszusi választásokon, Musk azt felelte,

sokkal kevesebbet fogok a jövőben.

Ezt azzal indokolta, hogy úgy érzi, már eleget tett. Azt egyelőre nem tudni, hogy mi lesz azzal a 100 millió dollárral, amit Trump politikai gépezetének ajánlott fel a félidős választások előtt.

Kapcsolódó cikkünk 2025. 05. 20. Bejelentette Elon Musk: végleg elzárhatja a pénzcsapokat

Azt hiszem, talán egy kicsit túl sok időt töltöttem a politikával

- mondta Musk az Ars Technica techportálnak adott e heti interjújában, majd hozzátette, ""csak a relatív időbeosztásom volt az, ami valószínűleg egy kicsit magas lett a kormányzati oldalon, és ezt jelentősen csökkentettem az elmúlt hetekben.""

Azon kívül, hogy Musk nem támogatta Trump vámemeléseit – aminek több ízben hangot adott –

a New York Times a mostani távozását két kisebb konfliktushoz köti.

Az egyik, hogy Musk bírálta a kongresszusi republikánusok költségvetés-tervezetét, amelyet Trump szóhasználatával élve ""egyetlen nagy, gyönyőrű törvényjavaslatnak"" kereszteltek.

Őszintén szólva csalódva fogadtam a hatalmas kiadási törvényjavaslatot, amely növeli a költségvetési hiányt, nem pedig csökkenti azt, és aláássa a DOGE csapatának munkáját

- vélekedett a milliárdos. A kritikára Stephen Miller, Trump kabinetfőnök-helyettese reagált palástolt módon, amikor arról posztolt X-en, hogy a javaslat az elemzések dacára igenis visszavágja a deficitet.

Musk emellett sikertelenül kelt ki az egyik amerikai riválisa, a Sam Altman által alapított OpenAI és az Egyesült Arab Emírségek közötti megállapodás ellen, amely egy óriási adatközpont építéséről szól Abu-Dzabiban. Musk elvileg David Sacksnél, az elnök AI-ügyekkel foglalkozó tanácsadójánál is panaszt tett, és el akarta érni, hogy xAI-t is bevegyék az alkuba, mindhiába.

Proiectul jurnalistic non profit Recorder a publicat raportul pentru cel de-al optulea an de existență. Veniturile totale ale anului 2024 sunt de 2.380.826 de euro, față de 1.325.812 de euro în 2023, ceea ce înseamnă un plus de 80% de la un an la altul.

Este un exercițiu anual de transparență pe care-l face proiectul Recorder.

90% vin din contribuțiile publicului

”Pentru sutele de comentarii care apar pe rețelele sociale la fiecare material pe care îl publicăm – „sunteți vânduți, v-ați dat cu sistemul!” – avem același răspuns: sursele noastre de finanțare au fost mereu la vedere pentru oricine a dorit să le afle”, au scris în deschiderea raportului anual Cristian Delcea și Mihai Voinea, cei doi lideri ai Recorder.

Fondat în 2017 de către jurnaliștii Cristian Delcea, Mihai Voinea, Andrei Crăciun și Răzvan Ionescu, Recorder a avut în primul an venituri de 56.000 de euro de la cititori. În 2024, suma a ajuns la 2,38 de milioane de euro.

Potrivit rapoartelor succesive ale Recorder, în ultimii cinci ani veniturile, în marea lor majoritate de la public, au evoluat astfel:

2020: 400.000 euro

2021: 850.000 euro

2022: 1.105.602 euro

2023: 1.325.000 euro

2024: 2.380.826 euro

În primele rapoarte, Recorder vorbea despre 80% din venituri direct din contribuțiile cititorilor, acum ponderea a ajuns la 90%.

”Pentru a-i putea critica pe toți”

”Recorder se finanțează în primul rând din contribuțiile directe ale publicului. Sunt zeci de mii de oameni care plătesc lunar sume modice sau completează anual Formularul 230 pentru ca noi să ne putem face meseria așa cum credem de cuviință, liberi de orice influență sau presiune. Constatăm cu bucurie că în România încă sunt destui oameni conștienți de faptul că o redacție de presă trebuie susținută nu pentru a-l lăuda pe politicianul favorit, ci a pentru a-i putea critica pe toți”, au scris jurnaliștii în raportul către public.

Raportul prezintă și realizările jurnalistice. ”Nemulțumiri vor exista întotdeauna, iar noi le-am resimțit și atunci când am scris despre campania lui Nicușor Dan, și atunci când am arătat isprăvile de tinerețe ale lui George Simion sau Călin Georgescu”.

”Am produs un documentar de două ore despre „Deceniul Iohannis”, ca să înțelegem mai bine ce s-a întâmplat cu România în ultimii zece ani. Am scris despre cum e să fii femeie în politica din România, am demontat mitul eroului de la Nassiriya, am scris despre noua epocă a escrocheriilor de pe internet, am dezvăluit lucruri puțin cunoscute din biografia politicianului care a condus Guvernul României în ultimii ani, am devoalat schema Nordis – investigație care a depășit 3 milioane de vizualizări și care a produs un cutremur pe scena politică din România”, spune redacția Recorder.

Granturile reprezintă 4% din sumă

În anul 2024, veniturile au fost de 2,38 de milioane de euro și cheltuielile de 1,29 milioane de euro. La organizațiile non profit, diferența între venituri și cheltuieli pe parcursul unui an fiscal se constituie ca rezervă pentru activitatea ulterioară, nu se distribuie.

Care este, comparativ cu piața, performanța Recorder? În România, veniturile Recorder au ajuns să depășească chiar și instituții din zona radio, unde de regulă veniturile sunt mai mari decât în online. Comparativ, pe 2023 conform surselor publice analizate de ziaristul Petre Barbu în Forbes, Radio Guerrilla avea venituri de 1,9 milioane de euro, iar Radio Rock FM de 1,05 milioane de euro. În online, societatea Media Bit Software SRL, care editează siteul HotNews, a avut în 2023, conform termene, venituri de 1,9 milioane de euro.

Conform raportului pe categorii, veniturile de 2,38 de milioane de euro ale Recorder în 2024 au venit din:

1.108.044 euro – Redirecționare 3,5% persoane fizice

702.310 euro – Donații persoane fizice (Braintree, PayPal, cont direct, Patreon, SMS, Benevity, Pago, Youtube Membership)

290.480 euro – Redirecționare 20% persoane juridice

92.144 euro – Granturi (Active Citizens Fund, Media Development Investment Fund, Prague Civil Society, Adobe)*

74.511 euro – YouTube Advertising

Granturile reprezintă 4% din suma strânsă. ”Pentru că la ultimul raport s-au făcut diverse interpretări pe seama veniturilor generate din granturi, considerăm util să detaliem sursele exacte de finanțare ale fiecărui grant menționat în tabelul de mai sus”, a explicat Recorder. Granturile sunt: ”Active Citizens Fund – finanțare de la statele Norvegia, Islanda și Liechtenstein; MDIF – finanțare de la programul Amplify Europe, care este finanțat în totalitate prin granturi de la Loteriile Poștale din Olanda și Germania; Prague Civil Society – finanțare de la USAID, agenție guvernamentală americană; Adobe – finanțare de la compania privată Adobe”.Redacția a mai anunțat că ”Emisiunea Știrile Zilei, care face rezumatul celor mai importante evenimente, de luni până vineri, a ajuns la o audiență medie de peste 100.000 de vizionări pe ediție, iar canalul de YouTube Știrile Zilei a atins borna de 200.000 de abonați.

En las montañas de la disputada región de Cachemira, los paquistaníes bombardearon posiciones indias con misiles de largo alcance PL-15, también fabricados en China, país que suministra más del 80% de las armas importadas por Islamabad.

Aquella fue la primera vez que el mundo vio esas armas punteras chinas desplegadas en un combate real. Las potencias occidentales, sobre todo Estados Unidos, tomaron buena nota y analizaron cada detalle del enfrentamiento, conscientes de que el desarrollo armamentístico de Pekín había sido clave para que su aliado de Pakistán, con una fuerza militar muy inferior a la India, aguantara el intercambio de ataques con el país vecino antes de que ambos acordaran una tregua.

El ascenso del músculo militar chino preocupa mucho en Washington y ha sido uno de los asuntos más relevantes que se están tratando en el Diálogo Shangri-La, el gran foro militar de Asia-Pacífico que arrancó el viernes en un lujoso hotel de Singapur con la presencia de ministros de Defensa, generales y altos funcionarios de 47 países. El acto más esperado era la intervención del secretario de Defensa de EEUU, Pete Hegseth, quien hizo el sábado sus esperadas primeras declaraciones en público sobre la política de seguridad que seguirá el Gobierno de Trump en la región.

Hegseth sorprendió desplegando una narrativa mucho más agresiva y vehemente para apuntar que la amenaza de China es real, al tiempo que presionó a sus aliados en la región para que aumentaran su gasto en defensa y que no dependan tanto de la protección de Washington. ""No hay razón para edulcorarlo. La amenaza que representa China es real y podría ser inminente"", soltó. ""Tiene que quedar claro para todos que Pekín se está preparando de manera creíble para utilizar potencialmente la fuerza militar para alterar el equilibrio de poder en el Indo-Pacífico"", continuó.

El secretario estadounidense dijo que sus aliados asiáticos debían tomar como ejemplo a los países europeos, citando las promesas de los miembros de la OTAN de avanzar hacia el objetivo de gasto de Trump del 5% del PIB. ""La disuasión no es barata"" subrayó. Sobre la estrategia de su país en la región, Hegseth desveló que EEUU estaba ""reorientándose hacia la disuasión de la agresión de la China comunista"" porque Asia es ""el teatro prioritario de operaciones"" de Washington. ""Nos comprometemos a garantizar que China no pueda dominarnos a nosotros, ni a nuestros aliados y socios"", concluyó.

Los funcionarios estadounidenses han señalado que el propósito de Hegseth es convencer a sus colegas asiáticos de que EEUU es un socio mucho más confiable que China. Un mensaje que no ha cuajado en la mayoría de países de la región, a quienes la guerra comercial de Trump y su imprevisible diplomacia preocupa igual o más que la asertividad de China en puntos calientes como Taiwan o las islas en disputa del Mar de China Meridional.

""Las acciones de Trump han erosionado la legitimidad moral de EEUU y está cambiando su imagen en Asia de liberador a gran perturbador y terrateniente global"", dijo a principios de año el entonces ministro de Defensa de Singapur, Ng Eng Hen. ""Las tácticas coercitivas de Trump y su creciente presión sobre el orden internacional, creado por el propio EEUU, están llevando la política global por un camino peligroso. Nos dirigimos sin darnos cuenta hacia un mundo sin ley"", criticó esta semana José Ramos-Horta, presidente de Timor Oriental, quien recordó el vacío de ""poder blando"" dejado por Trump en la región después de suspender los programas de ayuda al desarrollo de la USAID.

Pero a diferencia de los bruscos giros de Trump en su agenda de defensa dirigida a Europa, con sus amenazas de retirarse de la OTAN y abandonar a Ucrania en su lucha contra la invasión de Rusia, parece que el papel de defensa que quiere desempeñar Washington en Asia-Pacífico mantiene la línea de anteriores gobiernos estadounidenses, centrada en seguir fortaleciendo los lazos con sus tradicionales aliados para contrarrestar la influencia china.

""Estados Unidos está aquí y no se irá a ninguna parte. Estamos aquí para disuadir a los adversarios que buscan hacernos daño"", afirmó el viernes Hegseth en un discurso delante de marines que estaban a bordo de un buque de la armada de EEUU en Singapur.

En los últimos años, el Diálogo Shangri-La ha concentrado la atención internacional por ser uno de los pocos escenarios en los que se encuentran jefes militares de las dos superpotencias. Pero a diferencia de otras ocasiones, Pekín no ha enviado a Singapur a su ministro de Defensa. La delegación china la componen altos funcionarios militares que han celebrado reuniones con representantes de otras naciones asiáticas, de Estados Unidos e invitados procedentes de Reino Unido, Alemania y Francia.

Como en cada foro militar asiático, la situación de Taiwan, la isla autónoma que China considera parte de su territorio, está siendo uno de los temas más delicados a tratar durante el encuentro. Pekín continúa presionando a Taipei con frecuentes simulacros de invasión mientras que su gran valedor internacional, EEUU, sigue ayudando a reforzar las defensas de la isla. En cambio, la administración Trump, a diferencia de la anterior, todavía no se ha pronunciado sobre sí defendería a Taiwan en caso de un ataque de China.

Durante su comparecencia en el foro, Hegseth recogió unas palabras de Trump en las que aseguraba que China no invadirá Taiwan durante su mandato, pero que cualquier acción en esa dirección ""tendría consecuencias devastadoras para el Indo-Pacífico y el mundo"".

Otro de los asuntos críticos a discutir en Singapur es la amenaza nuclear de Corea del Norte. Hace un par de meses, los medios norcoreanos publicaron imágenes de Kim inspeccionando el primer submarino de propulsión nuclear en construcción, un sistema de armas de entre 6.000 y 7.000 toneladas con capacidad para transportar alrededor de una decena de misiles. Cuando salió la noticia del submarino, muchos analistas pusieron en duda que un país tan aislado, sancionado y empobrecido como Corea del Norte hubiera podido obtener los recursos para construir un arma tan poderosa sin asistencia tecnológica de su aliado de Moscú.",2025-05-31 07:22:05+00:00,https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2025/05/31/683aabf7e85ece4f208b459f.html,

МАДРИД, 31 мая. /ТАСС/. Президент Грузии Михаил Кавелашвили заявил, что после начала конфликта на Украине на его страну стало оказываться давление со стороны Запада, чтобы Тбилиси вмешался в происходящее.

По его мнению, к Грузии относятся несправедливо в ЕС. ""И поскольку Грузия является кандидатом [на вступление в сообщество], этот факт используется для давления на нее"", - сказал он в интервью испанской газете El Mundo. ""Когда началась война, это стало одним из факторов, который определил давление против нас со стороны определенных представителей европейских и американских структур.

""Страны, которые раньше поддерживали нашу территориальную целостность, начали применять двойные стандарты, которые угрожали целостности нашей страны, и у них были здесь свои союзники"", - уточнил Кавелашвили. Он пояснил, что говорит об НПО, которые финансировались, например, Агентством США по международному развитию (USAID), и которые имели значительные ресурсы. ""Через них началось давление, - добавил президент. - В Грузии у нас была информация о том, что поступают огромные деньги"".

我們想讓你知道的是

非洲及西方的保守派5月齊聚肯亞首都奈洛比，舉辦第二屆泛非洲家庭價值會議（Pan-African Conference on Family Values），齊聲喝斥「外國意識形態」正製造一場墮胎、同性戀、「性別錯亂」的「疫病」，並矢言捍衛非洲「傳統家庭價值」。

非洲右翼與美國右翼關係密切，非洲人權運動者指出，川普二度當選彷彿為全球反人權團體添柴加火，而美國國際開發署（USAID）遭關閉、相關性健康和倡導計畫經費遭砍，也使非洲各國性平法面臨反轉危機。

非洲基督教保守派自詡為《舊約聖經》中英勇、正義而虔誠的大衛，正奮力對抗輕蔑上帝的巨人歌利亞——自由派。非洲與西方保守派之間的關係一向緊密，但英媒《經濟學人》報導，兩大原因導致兩者關係如今更加升溫。

其一是千禧年初的非洲愛滋病大爆發。這引起美國福音派教會的注意，開始積極介入非洲同志議題並培育當地「反同戰士」。其二是歐巴馬當選美國總統。他於任內大力推動進步派法案，使不少國內保守派絕望認為美國大勢已去，轉而將希望寄託在「最後一塊淨土」非洲。

美國基督教保守派挹注千萬美元 擴大非洲影響版圖

外國保守派十多年來持續挹注非洲，意圖不斷右推當地輿論，增加保守派法案通過 。非洲今年已舉辦數場類似會議，背後多由勢力龐大的美國基督教保守派團體支持，例如反同婚、反墮胎的國際家庭守望（Family Watch International），以及促成美國「羅素韋德案」遭推翻的捍衛自由陣線（Alliance Defending Freedom）等。

新聞暨社會變革研究所（Institute for Journalism and Social Change）一份財報研究指出，2019至2022年間，共17個美國基督教組織向非洲提供了至少1650萬美元資金，2022年的資金量更是2019年的150%。

這直接導致了非洲基督教保守派的崛起。2014年，烏干達憲法法庭宣判一條反同性戀法違憲，2023年卻重新將同性性行為列為犯罪，最嚴重甚至可能遭判處死刑，是世界上最嚴苛的反同性戀法之一。

President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk celebrated their efforts to slash federal spending before Musk stepped away from his White House work. Musk wore a black DOGE hat over a bruised right eye that he blamed on his young son’s punch. That was May 30 in the Oval Office. Days later, the two billionaires were punching at each other on the social media platforms they own.

Their fight began over federal tax and spending legislation, with Musk calling a Trump-backed bill “a disgusting abomination” and Trump saying he was “very disappointed” with Musk. Soon, Musk claimed credit for Trump and Republicans winning in 2024, and Trump threatened to cut off Musk’s companies’ federal contracts.

I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025

The public display of animosity called into question the fate of months of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) work.

Under Musk’s oversight and with Trump’s approval, DOGE axed billions of dollars in grants for state health departments and scientific research. It gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers. It all but shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the decades-old department that provides food and healthcare to people in other countries.

Still, as Musk ended his work with DOGE, it was clear that the group’s cost-cutting achievements fell short of Musk’s goals. A week before Trump won his second term, Musk said he expected to cut “at least $2 trillion”, without identifying a timeframe for doing it. He later lowered that to $1 trillion.

But both figures were wildly unrealistic. Even if Musk could have eliminated every dollar of non-defence discretionary spending – everything from air traffic control, medical research, federal prosecutors and prisons to border control, US embassies and national parks – he wouldn’t have reached his $1 trillion goal.

As of early June, DOGE’s online “wall of receipts” accounting of federal dollars cut said that the government had cut $180 billion. But analyses by PolitiFact, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the conservative American Enterprise Institute showed that the tallies Musk provided were flawed. And total 2025 federal spending under Trump has continued to grow.

Nat Malkus, an education policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said DOGE’s cuts showed an “appetite for recklessness”, and its error and exaggeration-filled wall of receipts provided “ample grounds for scepticism” about its accuracy. “Beyond that, the receipts only cover a fraction of their actions, making their accomplishments and savings impossible to verify,” Malkus said.

Savings amount unclear

DOGE’s “wall of receipts” reported that the $180bn savings represented a combination of actions, including lease and grant cancellations, “fraud and improper payment deletion” and eliminating employees.

During their May 30 news conference, Musk predicted savings would rise to $1 trillion, but their public dispute made DOGE’s future more uncertain. A few top lieutenants had already departed; dozens of DOGE employees remained.

DOGE says its wall of receipts is incomplete: “We are working to upload all of our receipts in a digestible and transparent manner consistent with applicable rules and regulations,” the website says, calling its list “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30 percent of total savings.”

And it has errors. For example, DOGE said it would save $740,457 by ending a lease that housed records for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. But the federal government had already planned to end that lease in 2025. The property’s leasing company told PolitiFact on May 30 that the government is still using the property and paying rent. If the government leaves before September, it will have to continue paying under the lease’s terms, unless another tenant is secured.

Some of DOGE’s contract and grant cancellations are being litigated, and the government may ultimately be required to fulfil them.

“Even for grants and contracts that DOGE cut, the claimed savings may never be realised,” Joshua Sewell, a federal budget expert at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said.

The $180bn figure was aspirational and projected, PolitiFact found.

“Itemised, verifiable cuts – those with receipts – are roughly half that amount,” said Dominik Lett, a budget policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Of those itemised cuts, there are numerous clerical errors and inflated savings values.”

Government officials did not respond to our questions about how many federal employees were cut. The New York Times reported that as of May 12, the government reduced its workforce by roughly 135,000, including cuts and buyouts. That amounts to a tiny portion of the 2.4 million federal workforce, with similarly modest savings in salaries. The Reuters news agency, counting early retirements in addition to buyouts and firings, said the tally was 260,000.

When 75,000 employees who took buyouts come off the books in October, that will save about $10bn a year, or 0.1 percent of federal spending, Jessica Riedl, an expert on the federal budget at the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in an essay for The Atlantic. (Trump quoted the 75,000 figure during his May 30 news conference.) But the government could end up hiring contractors to perform some of that work, further shrinking those savings.

Not every agency or department faced widespread cuts. The Justice Department’s staffing was reduced by about 1 percent, The New York Times found. But nearly all employees were cut at USAID and AmeriCorps. Nearly half of the Education Department’s staff were cut.

Federal government spending continues to rise. In April 2025, total spending was $594bn, $27bn more than in April 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That’s a 5 percent increase. The largest spending decrease – $17bn – came in the Department of Education, which Trump promised to eliminate. But Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid outlays rose, as did some department spending, including in agriculture and defence.

Some of DOGE’s line items show savings of zero dollars, which a White House spokesperson said means that the money has been spent but won’t be renewed, such as for news subscriptions or training. It also showed some negative values for grants; a State Department spokesperson said they were caused by an input error that had since been corrected, although it was still on the site as of about noon ET (16:00 GMT) on June 5.

It’s unclear whether DOGE’s spending cuts will be permanent because federal law requires the executive branch to send proposed cuts, known as “rescissions”, to Congress for approval. The White House on June 3 sent a $9.4bn package of rescission cuts to Congress that includes cutting foreign aid.

“DOGE can kill projects, but the spending doesn’t become savings until Congress votes to ‘unspend’ the money,” Malkus said.

DOGE also increased some government costs, such as those incurred when defending against lawsuits.

DOGE abruptly cut programmes but failed to find mass fraud

DOGE left no state untouched, according to an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It terminated leases and grants to health departments, universities and volunteer programmes across the country.

DOGE listed terminations of hundreds of millions of dollars in state health department grants, which represented some of the group’s biggest “savings”. These cuts targeted health departments in states including Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.

The administration said the cuts mostly affected money used for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

Twenty-three states challenged the cuts in a lawsuit that argued the move caused states “tremendous chaos” including “immediate harm to public health initiatives and the termination of large numbers of state and local public health employees and contractors”. In mid-May, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the federal government to release the frozen funding.

“These funds support state and local health departments in combatting infectious diseases, as well as offering mental health services and funding addiction treatment programmes,” said Lynn Sutfin, a state Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson in Michigan, one of the state plaintiffs.

Other cuts included nearly $400m in AmeriCorps grants, resulting in the terminations of more than 32,000 AmeriCorps members and volunteers, and the historic gutting of USAID, the nation’s federal international humanitarian and development arm.

One local AmeriCorps programme, Serve Louisiana, filed a lawsuit to stop cuts to its $700,000 grant that aimed to place 37 workers with Louisiana nonprofits, including a food bank, a library and Boys and Girls Clubs, through August. As of June 2, the lawsuit was ongoing.

“Our nonprofit partners are now scrambling to adapt without the help they counted on,” Serve Louisiana Executive Director Lisa Moore said.

USAID programmes aimed to reduce hunger and disease and promote democracy globally. In fiscal year 2024, USAID made up 0.3 percent of the federal budget. Weeks after Trump’s inauguration, DOGE froze nearly all of USAID’s spending and terminated nearly all employees.

Musk boasted on February 3 that DOGE had fed “USAID into the wood chipper”, and two weeks later he wielded a chainsaw at a conservative political event to symbolise what he said was his attack on federal bureaucracy.

USAID’s dismantling had sprawling global effects.

In Ukraine – the largest recipient of USAID funds since Russia’s 2022 invasion – regional media outlets lost funding and medical charities shuttered programmes that screened for and treated tuberculosis and HIV, NPR reported.

US diplomats in Malawi said US funding cuts to the United Nations World Food Programme increased criminal activity, sexual violence and human trafficking in a large refugee camp, ProPublica reported. American embassy officials in Kenya said funding cuts to refugee camp food programmes led to violent demonstrations, ProPublica said.

People also died because of the chaotic aid disruptions, according to Al Jazeera, NPR, The Associated Press, and other news organisations.

The consequences are still unspooling.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that up to four million people in Africa might die from treatable diseases without USAID funding. Former USAID officials told Reuters that, because of the cuts, food rations worth $98m that could supply 3.5 million people for a month are decaying in warehouses and some are likely to be destroyed. The World Health Organization cautioned in March that USAID cuts could trigger a global increase in tuberculosis cases and deaths.

Musk and Trump said that DOGE would ferret out fraud, too. Government reports predating Trump’s current term show fraud is a real problem, but so far DOGE has not proven that it has recently uncovered mass fraud.

A White House spokesperson said there had been 50 criminal referrals stemming from DOGE’s work and pointed to three individuals charged for voting as a noncitizen in New York or Florida. Statements by federal prosecutors said that DOGE assisted with the cases. Such cases had been prosecuted before DOGE’s creation.",2025-06-06T11:21:51Z,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/6/has-doge-really-saved-the-us-government-180bn,

Here is a story showcasing how innovation in Kenya’s electric mobility sector is helping to address real problems where it matters most. Pedestrian-pulled handcarts (called mkokoteni in Kenya) play a crucial role in Kenya, providing a channel for informal traders to get their goods all around from suppliers to marketplaces. The story of Ecomobilus sheds light on the potential for e-mobility to be transformational.

Ecomobilus Technologies Limited is a startup established in 2022 to pursue e-mobility and solar technological engineering projects. The formation of the company arose from a coinciding problem encountered by the founders (Paul Waweru and myself) regarding access to EV replacement batteries for their scooters in the aftermarket both in Kenya and even in the OEM source countries. Initial projects were focused on custom-designed lithium battery packs for aftermarket replacement for their customers. They achieved this by use of second-life lithium cells recovered selectively from discarded laptop batteries, most of which had over 80% integrity capacity.

The battery packs went a long way in providing affordable lithium batteries for e-mobility in Kenya for its early adopters. Then came the demand of those wishing to convert from gasoline internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs. In response to this, we undertook our first successful ICE to EV conversion of a motorcycle, which resulted in a series of conversions of several versions of motorcycles and quadbikes, with the patronage of Zetech University and Chandaria Business Incubation Centre, Kenyatta University. Lithium cells that could not provide sufficient capacity for EVs, but with at least 70% integrity capacity, were used to build solar charged power stations for use by small businesses such as saloons and barbershops at less than 30% the cost of an equivalent OEM product.

It was during this process that the company started getting media highlights from Kenya and internationally. This led us to receive a stream of invites for attendance at EV showcasing events sometimes supporting other existing EV companies that had a gap in their technical capacity. During these events, we met many enthusiasts who made requests for different EV products and lithium battery solutions. One of the clients was Sow Precise, who were carrying out a project dubbed “SunRider” to provide mobile irrigation as a service in a model akin to the “Uber” hailing cab service. They were operating a farm in Mbeere South, Embu County, approximately 150 km from the capital city of Kenya, Nairobi.

From the model farm, they would showcase effective irrigation models using solar, and from there provide solar powered irrigation services to their customers using a manual pedestrian-pulled handcart (called mkokoteni in Kenya) to move the irrigation implements from farm to farm in areas of 10 km square. This was not only tiresome but unsustainable because they could only manage to deliver the service to very few farms due to the time consumed pulling the mkokoteni. When they consulted us, we decided to take up the project of building for them an electric mkokoteni, that we dubbed emKoko.

The specifications for the emKoko were supposed to be 400kg LW, 4ft by 7ft, with a 48V 45Ah lithium battery and a 3kW motor including a rider seat. We commenced the project in mid-Aug 2024. This project posed to us a number of challenges. The biggest challenge was that we had no replica project in our view to benchmark from. This called for a lot of ingenuity and creativity. We modeled it after the traditional mkokoteni, except we had to consider ease of maneuverability in the farm, requiring good ground clearance, torque, off-road tackling, and all necessary rugged application — yet reliable enough to avoid challenges of sending our engineers to the distant field support. We, therefore, settled for a rear-seat-driven model similar to a loader and made some battery upgrades to 72V45AH to give it more muscle energy for 0.5T payload.

The engineers took a modular design of a separate chassis and the cargo bed, with a focus on coming up with a CKD product. The construction and assembly took us approximately 1 month, and few days were spent on wiring and other finishes. Our biggest challenge was cost because we often had to re-work a number of our designs at our cost since we had to deliver the best at the end of the day. As the work progressed, enthusiasm was very high, with our engineers working into nights and weekends and holding numerous consultative meetings in-house and with engineers drawn from other EV companies in Kenya, who would pay regular visits to assess our progress and give useful insights.

Finally, the end of September 2024 delivered our initial MVP and we proceeded with its final reviews and reworks to deliver the complete unit in the first week of October 2024. We shipped it on lorry to the client and went to its launch on 7th October 2024, with the occasion graced by the USAID Mission Director for Kenya and East Africa, David Gosney. Our profound gratitude goes to Ms Linda Kamau and the team of Sow Precise for believing in us and giving a platform to realize the first functional electric handcart in Kenya and in this region. Also, much thanks go to our engineering team, their friends, and the engineering fraternity (including EnviroServe) who made different contributions to the project, and to the entire Ecomobilus team. We now look forward to replicating this vehicle for all of Africa, where movement of heavy loads by human or animal-pulled carts is common in both cities and rural areas.

We are glad to partner with any organizations and entities who can extend funding or technical support. We have received numerous enquiries from across Africa, with some asking for several adaptations of the design to suit their countries’ policy limitations on EV design registration requirements. New projects underway include a solarized light car with Murang’a University of Technology, Kenya, and a new triad joint collaboration between Ecomobilus, Murang’a University, and the University of Kigali, Rwanda, for regional EV projects targeting the African markets.

Prof Gitau has made a bold move to resign from full time teaching employment to focus on the daunting task of building this startup. Initial signs are good, although they have not received funding yet. The flow of new orders is convincing and there are several overseas entrants who are courting them for a JV. The company has won several awards so far, including the Africa Green Technology Award at the Connected Africa Summit, 2024; and Zetech University’s Best Innovation in the year 2024.",2025-05-26T17:13:41Z,https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/26/the-life-story-of-ecomobilus-technologies-limited-kenya-emkoko-project/,

ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

American diplomats in at least two countries have recently delivered internal reports to Washington that reflect a grim new reality taking hold abroad: The Trump administration’s sudden withdrawal of foreign aid is bringing about the violence and chaos that many had warned would come.

The vacuum left after the U.S. abandoned its humanitarian commitments has destabilized some of the most fragile locations in the world and thrown refugee camps further into unrest, according to State Department correspondence and notes obtained by ProPublica.

The assessments are not just predictions about the future but detailed accounts of what has already occurred, making them among the first such reports from inside the Trump administration to surface publicly — though experts suspect they will not be the last. The diplomats warned in their correspondence that stopping aid may undermine efforts to combat terrorism.

In the southeastern African country of Malawi, U.S. funding cuts to the United Nations’ World Food Programme have “yielded a sharp increase in criminality, sexual violence, and instances of human trafficking” within a large refugee camp, U.S. embassy officials told the State Department in late April. The world’s largest humanitarian food provider, the WFP projects a 40% decrease in funding compared to last year and has been forced to reduce food rations in Malawi’s sprawling Dzaleka refugee camp by a third.

To the north, the U.S. embassy in Kenya reported that news of funding cuts to refugee camps’ food programs led to violent demonstrations, according to a previously unreported cable from early May. During one protest, police responded with gunfire and wounded four people. Refugees have also died at food distribution centers, the officials wrote in the cable, including a pregnant woman who died under a stampede. Aid workers said they expected more people to get hurt “as vulnerable households become increasingly desperate.”

“It is devastating, but it’s not surprising,” Eric Schwartz, a former State Department assistant secretary and member of the National Security Council during Democratic administrations, told ProPublica. “It’s all what people in the national security community have predicted.”

“I struggle for adjectives to adequately describe the horror that this administration has visited on the world,” Schwartz added. “It keeps me up at night.”

In response to a detailed list of questions, a State Department spokesperson said in an email: “It is grossly misleading to blame unrest and violence around the world on America. No one can reasonably expect the United States to be equipped to feed every person on earth or be responsible for providing medication for every living human.”

The spokesperson also said that “an overwhelming majority” of the WFP programs that the Trump administration inherited, including those in Malawi and Kenya, are still active.

But the U.S. funds the WFP on a yearly basis. For 2025, the Trump administration so far hasn’t approved any money in either country, forcing the organization to drastically slash food programs.

In Kenya, for example, the WFP will cut its rations in June down to 28% — or less than 600 calories a day per person — a low never seen before, the WFP’s Kenya country director Lauren Landis told ProPublica. The WFP’s standard minimum for adults is 2,100 calories per day.

“We are living off the fumes of what was delivered in late 2024 or early 2025,” Landis said. On a recent visit to a facility treating malnourished children younger than 5, she said she saw kids who were “walking skeletons like I haven’t seen in a decade.”

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has pledged to restore safety and security around the world. At the same time, his administration, working alongside Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, swiftly dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, canceling thousands of government-funded foreign aid programs they considered wasteful. More than 80% of USAID’s operations were terminated, which crippled lifesaving humanitarian efforts around the world.

Musk, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said that DOGE’s cuts to humanitarian aid have targeted fraudulent payments to organizations but are not contributing to widespread deaths. “Show us any evidence whatsoever that that is true,” he said recently. “It’s false.”

For decades, American administrations run by both parties saw humanitarian diplomacy, or “soft power,” as a cost-effective measure to help stabilize volatile but strategically important regions and provide basic needs for people who might otherwise turn to international adversaries. Those investments, experts say, help prevent regional conflict and war that may embroil the U.S. “If you don’t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Jim Mattis, who was defense secretary during Trump’s first administration, told Congress in 2013 when he led U.S. Central Command.

Food insecurity has long been closely linked with regional turmoil. But despite promises from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that lifesaving operations would continue amid widespread cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has terminated funding to WFP for several countries. Nearly 50% of the WFP’s budget came from the U.S. in 2024.

Since February, U.S. officials throughout the developing world have issued urgent warnings forecasting that the Trump administration’s decision to suddenly cut off help to desperate populations could exacerbate humanitarian crises and threaten U.S. national security interests, records show. In one cable, diplomats in the Middle East communicated concerns that stopping aid could empower groups like the Taliban and undermine efforts to address terrorism, the narcotics trade and illegal immigration. The shift may also “significantly de-stabilize the transitioning” region and “only serve to benefit ISIS’ standing,” officials warned in other correspondence. “It could put US troops in the region at risk.”

Embassies in Africa have delivered similar messages. “We are deeply concerned that suddenly discontinuing all USAID counter terrorism-focused stabilization and humanitarian programs in Somalia … will immediately and negatively affect U.S. national security interests,” the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia, wrote in February. USAID’s role in helping the military prevent newly liberated territory — “purchased at a high cost of blood and treasure” — from getting back into the hands of terrorists “is indisputable, and irreplaceable,” the officials added.

The embassy in Nigeria described how stop-work orders had caused lapses in oversight that put U.S. resources at risk of being diverted to criminal or terrorist groups. (A February whistleblower complaint alleged USAID-purchased computers were stolen from health centers there.) And U.S. officials said the Kenyan government “faces an impending humanitarian crisis for over 730,000 refugees” without additional resources, as local officials struggle to confront al-Shabaab, a major terrorist threat in the region, while also maintaining security inside the country’s refugee camps.

In early April, Jeremy Lewin — an attorney in his late 20s with no prior government experience who is currently in charge of the State Department’s Office of Foreign Assistance and running USAID operations — ordered the end of WFP grants altogether in more than a dozen countries. (Amid outcry, he later reinstated a few of them.) The State Department spokesperson said the agency was responding on Lewin’s behalf.

In Kenya, the WFP expects a malnutrition crisis after rations are cut to a fourth of the standard minimum, Landis said. She is also concerned about the security of her staff, who already travel with police escorts, given the likelihood that there will be more protests and that al-Shabaab might make further incursions into the camps.

In order for the U.S. to deliver its usual food aid to Kenya by the end of the year, it needed to be put on a boat already, Landis said. That has not happened.

In recent days, South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia have begged a visiting government delegation from the U.S. not to cut food rations any further, according to a cable documenting the visit. Aid workers in another group of camps in North Africa reported that they expect to run out of funding by the end of May for a program that fights malnutrition for 8,600 pregnant and nursing mothers.

Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world, Malawi has been a relative beacon of stability in a region that’s seen numerous civil wars and unrest in recent decades. Yet in early March, officials there warned Washington counterparts that cuts to the more than $300 million USAID planned to provide to the country in aid a year would dramatically increase “the effects of the worsening economy already in motion.”

At the time, 10 employees from a USAID-funded nonprofit had recently shown up unannounced at USAID’s offices in the capital Lilongwe asking for their unpaid wages after the U.S. froze funding. The group left without incident, and it’s unclear if they were paid, but officials reported that they expected countries around the world would face similar issues and were closely monitoring for “increased risks to the safety and security of Embassy personnel.” (Former employees at another nonprofit in a nearby country also raided their organization “out of desperation for not being paid,” according to State Department records.)

An hour’s drive from the nation’s capital, Dzaleka is a former prison that was transformed into a refugee camp in the 1990s to house people fleeing war in neighboring Mozambique. In the decades since, it has ballooned, filling with people running from conflicts in Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. The camp, which was built to hold around 10,000, is now home to more than 55,000 people.

Iradukunda Devota, a refugee from Burundi, came to Malawi when she was 3 and has lived at Dzaleka for 23 years. She now works for Inua Advocacy, which provides legal services and advocates on behalf of refugees in the camp. She said tension is high amid rumors that food and other aid will be cut further. Since 2023, the Malawi government has prohibited refugees from living or working outside the camp, and there has already been an increase in crime and substance abuse after food was cut earlier this year. “This is happening because people are hungry,” Devota told ProPublica. “They have nowhere to turn to.”

Now, the Malawi government is likely to close its borders to refugees in response to the funding crisis and congestion in Dzaleka, the WFP’s country representative told the State Department, according to agency records.

Diplomats continue to warn the Trump administration of even worse to come. The WFP expects to suspend food assistance in Dzaleka entirely in July.

“The WFP anticipates violent protests,” the embassy told State Department officials, “which could potentially embroil host communities and refugees, and targeting of UN and WFP offices when the pipeline eventually breaks.”

The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria’s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.

“Feeding is severely difficult,” said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa — virtually the entire population — rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated “safe zone,” which severely limits farming.

For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.

Programs serving children were hit hard.

Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.

But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.

She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.

“I don’t want to bury another child,” she said.

‘Very traumatic’

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno's capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama's surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

“Before the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,” said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. “Now my biggest worry is high mortality. We don’t have enough resources to keep up.”

Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.

The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.

“It used to be far less,” said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.

Beyond nutrition

The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration's reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.

“Before, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,” said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. “Now, that has stopped.”

Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, “sadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.” He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.

A global problem

The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps' vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.

In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with “devastating” effects on the needy, said Frederico João, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.

More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique's health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inocêncio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.

What impact are the Trump administration's USAID cuts having on health care in Africa?

For the inhabitants of remote South African villages, getting access to medication is a challenge. HIV patients like 19-year-old Nozuko Majola must travel more than an hour to get the vital antiretroviral medication they need. But it wasn't always like this.

""We used to get the drugs delivered to our homes, but since Donald Trump announced he was cutting aid, the drugs have stopped coming. I'm worried that this service will be canceled altogether,"" Majola told DW.

She is one of an estimated 8 million people living with HIV in South Africa. The country has one of the highest rates of HIV in the world. Another HIV patient, Nozuko Ngaweni, who has been taking antiretroviral medications (ARVs) for decades, now fears for her life.

""When I heard that the US had canceled its aid, I felt like I was dying,"" she said. ""I asked myself: 'Will I get medication next month? I have medication for this month, but what comes after?'""

The US has donated to South Africa's health sector for many decades, primarily to combat HIV/AIDS. In 2023, the US gave the country $400 million (€352 million) in funding.

The US funding cuts to South Africa's HIV/AIDS programs could lead to more than 500,000 deaths over the next decade, the head of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, Linda-Gail Bekker, told reporters in February. After taking office on January 20, President Trump issued an executive order that paused foreign aid assistance for 90 days. The review ended with the decision to dismantle USAID as an independent agency. The administration slashed 90% of foreign contracts and grants funded by the US aid agency.

Such funding cuts have been a blow to many African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is the second-largest recipient of USAID funding worldwide, receiving $12.7 billion (€11.2 billion) in 2024. Up to 4 million additional people could now die from treatable diseases in Africa as a result of the loss of US funding, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

Catastrophic consequences

The pan-African NGO Amref Health Africa, which trains specialists and provides medical care to almost 20 million people a year, lost 20% of its budget primarily due to the US cuts. In Ethiopia, educational programs for thousands of young people have been canceled, while 500,000 tuberculosis screenings could no longer be carried out in Tanzania, according to Amref.

""We are seeing massive gaps in all countries. All sectors where humanitarian aid is needed are affected,"" said Lara Dovifat, head of advocacy at Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontières, MSF) in Germany. In South Sudan, MSF is struggling to respond to a cholera outbreak, due to a shortage of aid workers after USAID-funded clinics were forced to close.

""The consequences are catastrophic,"" Dovifat told DW of the cuts.

Dovifat also points to the example of Somalia: ""The number of malnourished children is rising because so many nutrition centers have had to close.""

Meanwhile, in Sudan, a water supply system that operated with USAID funding was shut down overnight.

Spread of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV

The cut in funding related to the fight against HIV/AIDS is particularly dramatic. The US is no longer funding UNAIDS, the UN's HIV/AIDS funding program that goes to communities around the globe. Some have called the US cuts in aid the biggest blow to the global effort to fight the disease.

In Kenya, funding has gone down from $846 million to just $66 million for 2025. Numerous HIV treatment centers have closed, with up to a million people infected with HIV lacking medication.

Nigeria is also heavily dependent on USAID funding. Although the government was able to release around $3.2 million in US aid for HIV medication, without continued US support, setbacks in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are certain.

To finance the fight against these three infectious diseases, the international community set up the Global Fund in Geneva in 2002. Michael Byrne, head of the Global Fund's technical advice and partnerships department, is especially concerned about the cutbacks in malaria prevention programs.

""If you don't get malaria under control, then it's very likely that there will be a significant resurgence and deaths,"" Byrne told DW. Malaria claims 600,000 lives every year, most of them are children under the age of 5 in Africa, according to the World Health Organization.

'We are losing 10 to 20 years of progress'

MSF's Dovifat also fears the cuts could undo the progress made in the area of disease prevention.

""We are losing 10 to 20 years of progress in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Many programs have been stopped, including programs for tuberculosis and outbreak control,"" she said.

The US is also cutting funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global health partnership that provides vaccines to children in low-income countries. USAID accounts for about 13% of Gavi's budget. As a result, 75 million children are expected to miss routine vaccinations over the next five years, which could result in up to 1.3 million preventable deaths, according to the organization.

Countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where MSF plays a crucial role in providing vaccines in areas with limited access to health care, will be heavily affected by the withdrawal of US funding to Gavi.

Yet, despite the setbacks, Byrne, the head of the Global Fund, remains hopeful about the future. Countries across sub-Saharan Africa have been quick to plan on the national level and come up with domestic funding, he said.

""For example, Uganda and Malawi have issued communiques stating that their countries would step in to fill the gaps,"" he said. ""They have implemented policy measures to support the work of community health workers.""

Many in the sector hope that other countries will not follow the US and cut funds too.

""The situation we find ourselves in now is not just about one country. There has been a trend in this direction for some time,"" Byrne said. ""If we don't get infectious diseases under control, we will have to pay more later — and wealthier countries will feel that too.""

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno’s capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama’s surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

“Before the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,” said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. “Now my biggest worry is high mortality. We don’t have enough resources to keep up.”

Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.

The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.

“It used to be far less,” said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.

Beyond nutrition

The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration’s reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.

“Before, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,” said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. “Now, that has stopped.”

Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, “sadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.” He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.

A global problem

The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps’ vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.

In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with “devastating” effects on the needy, said Frederico João, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.

More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique’s health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inocêncio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.

U.S. Africa Command, which does everything from helping the Somalian military target strikes on al-Shabaab to sending Army civil affairs soldiers to build schools in Cameroon, is working out what their new role on the continent will look like as the U.S. halts aid that was meant to stabilize those countries and make it easier for them to defend themselves.

“Some things that we used to do, we may not do anymore,” AFRICOM commander Marine Gen. Michael Langley, speaking from the 2025 African Chiefs of Defense Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, told reporters Thursday. “So we're asking you to step up and burden-share with us.”

For two decades, U.S. troops have deployed to Africa for exercises like African Lion and Flintlock, which improve the U.S.’s ability to operate in Africa at the same time as it trains up local militaries to be able to defend themselves against their biggest threats.

“Let me speak plainly about the threats we're facing, especially in the Sahel region—including Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger—it is the flash point of prolonged conflict and growing instability,” Langley said. “It is the epicenter of terrorism on the globe.”

ISIS and al-Qaida-affiliated groups are “thriving” in the Sahel, he added. Burkina Faso’s government has lost control of vast swathes of their own territory.

“Extremist groups are gaining ground and also expanding their ambitions,” he said. “Therein lies the threat to the homeland, as they gain in capability and capacity.”

In that vein, the U.S. has for decades worked with those countries to train their militaries as well as provide aid for education, food and clean water, ensuring populations have basic necessities that keep them from turning to terror groups to survive.

Groups like al-Shabaab, al-Qaida’s biggest and most well-funded affiliate, are already anticipating an opportunity to amp up operations as Somalia loses U.S. Agency for International Development funding.

“Well, I'll just say this, what I've seen with al-Shabaab—they're making assumptions that there's going to be gaps in aid in certain regions across Somalia, and there's shadow governments,” Langley said. “They're trying to exploit that scene. But the quicker the federal government of Somalia steps up and goes in those areas—and they're already continuing operations in those areas, so time will tell.”

With that aid pulled, AFRICOM is urging partner nations to step up where the U.S. has fallen back.

“Now, we recognize that direct U.S. assistance must adapt to an updated strategy aligned with national defense priorities,” Langley said. “Our goal is not to do more for Africa. It's to help Africa do more for itself. African nations must assume more responsibility for their security. The U.S. will continue to support, but support will be on our overlapping security interests and must be matched by local leadership.”

U.S. military support will continue to include intelligence sharing, Langley said, as well as partner exercises, the “most credible” way to increase African countries’ military capacity while also benefitting U.S. troops.

At the same time, China can and has stepped in to provide aid to Africa and otherwise fill gaps left by the U.S., though their influence model depends more on lending to African governments.

“Last September at the forum on China and Africa cooperation, Chairman Xi [Jinping] said they're going to step up their engagements across Africa,” Langley said.

African troops attend professional military education programs in Beijing, he said, similarly to the U.S.’s International Military Education Program.

“Then they also said they're going to increase security and training in a number of countries, so they’re trying to replicate what we do,” he said. “They're stepping it up and trying to replicate every type of thing, whether it be advise-and-assist type of training and specialized military domains, or putting on exercises like they did in the fall.”",2025-05-29T21:15:17Z,https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/05/africom-asks-help-deterring-terrorism-after-trump-pulls-aid-allied-countries/405684/,

The large-scale investment appeal arrives amid growing industry buzz surrounding the concept of regenerative agriculture. It also comes as international development organizations face new funding roadblocks.

In “The Regenerative Coffee Investment Case,” the nonprofit said that transitioning to regenerative agriculture could increase smallholder coffee farmer income by an average of 62%, and boost production and exports by approximately 30%. Additionally, the transition would reduce current greenhouse gas emissions associated with farm activities by 3.5 million tons of CO2e annually, while restoring and protecting natural environments.

“These findings confirm what TechnoServe has observed over decades of working with coffee farmers: Regenerative agriculture is not only good for nature, but essential for smallholder livelihoods and the future of the industry,” Paul Stewart, global coffee director at TechnoServe, said in an announcement of the report. “It’s an investment that pays off for farmers, businesses and the planet.”

The numbers above reflect modeling associated with smallholder farmers in nine key coffee-producing countries — Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Honduras, Indonesia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Peru and Kenya.

The report estimates that investment in smallholder adoption of regenerative agriculture averaging $560 million per year over seven years in seven of these countries — Brazil and Vietnam excluded — would result in $2.6 billion in additional coffee exports, and $2.1 billion in farmer income each year.

The report was supported by Swiss multinational Nestlé and its coffee-focused subsidiary Nespresso, global coffee giant JDE Peet’s, and the nonprofit Rudy & Alice Ramsey Foundation.

The report’s call for a seven-year, $4 billion investment comes at a time when U.S. government-supported aid for coffee sector development projects has essentially come to a halt. USAID, which has been gutted under the Donald Trump administration, has been funding TechnoServe-led projects since at least the 1980s, including multiple coffee sector projects launched since 2020.

The report calls for substantial private-sector investment in regenerative agriculture, as well as collaboration among “investors, industry, government and service providers.” Given its vast scope, the report also suggests that the scale of investments and their impacts will vary based on region and existing practices.

Generally speaking, the report focused on typical, or “archetypal,” smallholder farm scenarios for each of the countries, excluding the kinds of large estate-style farms that account for approximately 20-40% of the world’s coffee production.

In a press release from TechnoServe, representatives of Nestlé and JDE Peet’s each praised their respective companies’ existing sustainability schemes, while signaling support for future investments in regenerative agriculture.

“We’ve experienced first-hand how implementing regenerative practices help farmers tackle long-standing challenges like profitability and climate impact,” Nadia Hoarau-Mwaura, global responsible sourcing director for JDE Peet’s, said. “This detailed study offers a clear, practical path to implementing regenerative agriculture at scale — one that requires industry-wide collaboration. At JDE Peet’s, we are proud to support and help lead this transition.”

Look around Caitlin Tulloch's home in Oakland, California, and it's clear that the world outside the U.S. has made an impression on her.

""This is a really lovely piece of embroidery that I bought in a town called Mae Hong Son in Thailand,"" she says, gesturing to a red tapestry woven through with geometric forms. She has other textiles, too — from Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Laos and Uzbekistan. Some she's purchased in person while abroad. Others she's received as gifts.

On her office door is a little gold placard that her husband had made for her. It reads: ""Caitlin Tulloch, Grand Poobah of Cost Effectiveness.""

Sponsor Message

Tulloch is an economist. And cost effectiveness is what she has focused on for more than a decade. She uses data to work towards the biggest humanitarian bang for the buck: saving more lives, educating more children and lifting more people out of poverty as affordably and effectively as possible.

This is the work she'd been doing while on staff at USAID since 2023 when, earlier this year, DOGE and the Trump administration began pausing and then shutting down thousands of the agency's contracts. Funding for most of the foreign aid agency's programs evaporated almost overnight.

""It was all very confusing,"" recalls Tulloch. ""But in a very, very short period of time, what USAID had historically been doing was just wiped off the map.""

Tulloch was let go and reinstated by the agency multiple times before ultimately resigning. It was around that time that she and several colleagues, some of whom had been laid off, went on to create a special kind of matchmaking service. They call themselves Project Resource Optimization (PRO).

The idea was simple — out of the ashes of the dismantling of much of U.S. foreign assistance, Tulloch and her team would guide philanthropists who want to help but are uncertain how to do so. They would offer advice on where to invest their money for the biggest impact.

A most important spreadsheet

Here's how this effort got started.

At first, when USAID was being decimated and Tulloch and her coworkers watched their efforts go up in smoke, she says there was ""a large community of people processing a lot of grief.""

They managed to find ways to take care of one another, even at a distance. The daily texts of cat pictures began in February.

""I think we just needed things to smile at,"" says Tulloch. ""It actually became a very nice routine amongst our team. If something bad would happen, they would be like, 'Well, we need a thread of everyone's pets.' ""

Pretty soon, Tulloch started contemplating what to do next. ""Thinking about what I can do with my skill set to take care of people, improve human welfare,"" she says.

And then, in late February, she got a couple of phone calls from two well-heeled foundations that she'd interacted with previously and that support groups overseas. They were grappling with a conundrum. In a world where the U.S. has now largely retreated from its commitment to foreign aid, they wanted to know how to donate their money to have the greatest impact on saving lives. Of the thousands of programs the agency once supported at a level of some $35 billion , which should these foundations help fund?

""All of a sudden, people are saying, 'Out of all of that, if I have $2 million, if I have $5 million, what should I pick up?,' "" Tulloch recalls.

She decided this was the perfect project to focus on. So she and several colleagues went to ForeignAssistance.gov and downloaded a spreadsheet listing all the foreign aid programs that USAID had been funding. It amounted to 22,724 commitments.

""They're tagged by country and by sector and by purpose and by implementing partner and by funding source,"" says Tulloch. When an NPR reporter visited her in April, she called up the spreadsheet that she and her team assembled to track all these fields and scrolled through the document that now satisfyingly consumes her life.

Sponsor Message

There are basic sanitation programs in Ghana, tuberculosis control initiatives in Malawi, STD control projects in Nepal, and on and on. Line after line after line.

""Each of these represents an obligation in a particular country,"" Tulloch says. ""It's like a heat map of what was being done, where.""

Tulloch and her small team applied a series of filters to the spreadsheet, trying to hone in on the programs that were the most cost effective and that had the potential to save the most lives. For instance, they removed projects focused on improving the work environment or fostering biodiversity. ""Not because those were bad objectives,"" she says, ""but simply because that wasn't the focus of this initiative."" They also filtered geographically, focusing on lower income countries.

""And we were still at 2,000 rows and $9 billion,"" she says. She thought to herself, ""I don't know what else to filter out here. It's really a terrible set of decisions.""

They then waded through the descriptions for all 2,000 rows and reached out to numerous programs around the world to make sure their funding had indeed been withdrawn — and if so, how urgent their unfinished work was. PRO sent out a survey that asked the program staff to check off which proven lifesaving interventions they were currently delivering and to how many people. Things like emergency food assistance, syphilis detection and treatment, the spraying of insecticide on home surfaces to kill the mosquitoes that spread malaria, and more. PRO then conducted a quick check on the efficiency of that delivery to come up with their short list.

So far, the team has 54 projects totaling almost $96.5 million that they call ""Urgent and Vetted.""

A match made in Mali

When Tulloch first surveyed this list, one ""row"" leapt to the front of the line. ""It's a project in Mali that was delivering treatment for acute malnutrition for children, mostly under 5,"" she says, along with other health issues. The work was being done by the global NGO Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in the middle of an ongoing civil war affecting most of the country.

""So in these conditions, [the people are] unable to produce food,"" says Dr. Geoffray Kakesi Mambweni through an interpreter. He runs the Mali arm of the ALIMA group. ""They're unable to harvest. They're unable to travel because of all these risks that are present.""

One of the most successful programs run by Kakesi's team of 109 people is providing young kids a fortified peanut-based paste called Plumpy'Nut that is extraordinarily effective in treating malnutrition. ""Many of these children would be dead at this stage without this kind of a program,"" he explains.

That's why his team was distressed when, earlier this year, the U.S. government asked them to suspend their work so that an evaluation could be conducted. Kakesi says they were subsequently told by USAID to fire their staff and liquidate their supplies, including fuel and medicines. It wasn't clear whether USAID would restore their award. Ultimately, it was reinstated but the funding will only last until July. And ALIMA wasn't confident the grant would be renewed at that point.

A US State Department spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR: ""USAID's grant with ALIMA in Mali is active and running,"" and added, ""We will continue to make changes as needed.""

""We didn't want ALIMA to be in a position of stop, start, stop, start funding,"" says Tulloch. ""There is still a cliff coming. And there was still an interruption in funds being paid in the meantime that was preventing ALIMA from doing their work.""

This instability is part of the broader foreign aid landscape that she and her colleagues are now navigating. ""We have been chasing a moving target since day one,"" she says. ""It is inherently a very volatile environment in which to be making decisions.""

The PRO team determined that with a relatively small investment, the program could sustain its distribution of life-saving nutritional support to thousands of women and children, independent of U.S. funding decisions. If ALIMA waited too long, however, Tulloch and her colleagues felt it would be almost impossible to resume, given the challenges of operating in a war zone.

Sponsor Message

So PRO called up the Boston-based CRI Foundation , which funds global health development work in Africa and said they should act now and contribute to the Mali project. PRO was transparent about the possible resumption of USAID funds and the unlikely chances of a grant renewal in July. The possible downside of waiting was just too great in their estimation.

""And so we're now in this kind of matchmaking role,"" says Tulloch.

Kara Weiss, the foundation's executive director, was excited to hear about the opportunity in Mali. Her team had been wondering where to invest once the U.S. cut foreign aid. It had all seemed so impenetrable. So they reached out to other foundations and former USAID colleagues to figure out what to do, which led them to Tulloch.

""To have someone come to you and say, 'Well, we're just gonna go through the entire portfolio and get some answers,' like, yes, please,"" Weiss says. ""It's been a remarkably helpful initiative.""

The foundation wound up contributing $2.5 million to the Mali program — about half of what the group used to receive from USAID over a two year period. Still, the new influx of funds will allow ALIMA to extend some of its most pressing work in the country through mid-2026, independent of a grant renewal by the U.S. government.

""I think it's clear that private philanthropy is not going to be able to fill all the gaps,"" says Weiss. ""But what we can do is staunch the bleeding, keep projects functioning so that it's possible for local organizations or local governments to take them over.""

Tulloch agrees. ""If we all wait until all of the dust settles, it's going to be a worse outcome that we're going to arrive at than if people take some of these bets right now,"" she says. She has found that not all donors are comfortable with contributing to an ecosystem characterized by such uncertainty, but the CRI Foundation was willing to take that risk.

Sponsor Message

In the meantime, ALIMA was thrilled with the news. ""When I was able to inform our teams who are out in the field that we had finally secured financing,"" says Kakesi, ""it was just so much joy. So this financing really gave us hope. And at the same time, we did have to prioritize because this is indeed more limited funding.""

He says his team will spend the money in the neediest regions of the country.

A closing window

Una Osili , the associate dean at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, finds PRO's matchmaking effort innovative and essential.

""No single actor can solve the scale of problems that the world has to deal with,"" she says, ""whether that's in health care, education, agriculture, energy. And increasingly, we think about blended finance models as well as new forms of capital."" Such funds might come from governments, the private sector and philanthropic interests across the Global North and Global South, she argues.

Osili brings up a standard critique of private global development philanthropy — that it tends to operate at a small scale and does so with minimal coordination with government agencies. By contrast, in her view, the PRO project is harnessing the reams of data that the U.S. government has accumulated over the years to rectify a key ""information asymmetry"" that often plagues donors who don't know how best to make a difference.

In addition, Osili says philanthropy's key advantage is that it's freed from the constraints that bind other entities, including governments. ""Private donors don't have to respond to election cycles,"" says Osili. ""They can work in real time, so philanthropy has flexibility, agility and the ability to essentially experiment.""

The Mali program is one of now 13 matches that the PRO team has helped facilitate so far. And PRO, which is now being hosted by the think tank Center for Global Development , has a singular focus — securing funding for as many programs as they can on that Urgent and Vetted shortlist.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

This matchmaking process, says Tulloch, ""is not intended to be a long-term thing. I think we expect to do this for another four or five weeks. After that, the projects in our database will all largely have closed down. This is very time sensitive.""

Sponsor Message

That's because the window for restarting de-funded projects is closing. Staff will soon go elsewhere, supplies will dry up. Tulloch knows well that most of the projects in that spreadsheet of hers will flatline.

""There's no justice in any of this,"" she says, ""that anybody should have to be sitting here and filtering a spreadsheet in this way as the means of making decisions of such consequence. Not everybody's going to make it.""

""This is not about getting everything we want, making things whole again,"" Tulloch admits. ""I would like to make the world a better and slightly more just place for other people. And that's something we can do, even if it doesn't fix everything.""

""Our members are surviving with grace,"" says Justine Adhiambo Obura, the chairperson of No Sex for Fish.

She's talking about a cooperative of 20 women who did the unthinkable. They are fishmongers from the village of Nduru Beach in Kenya who said no to fishermen who demanded: Give me sex, and I'll make sure you get fish to sell.

With the support of various charities and programs, these women eventually got their own boats — and hired men to fish for them in Lake Victoria. The name of their group is a testament to their success.

But in the year 2025, their survival is precarious. The No Sex for Fish women are coping with the legacy of disastrous floods that have virtually destroyed their village and disrupted the fishing business. And now they're facing new fears about their health.

Eleven of these women are HIV positive. Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S.

But in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted.

A single mom's story

Rebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place.

Their former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees.

While scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries.

She says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be ""the displacement from my home"" because of the flooding — and earning a living.

Now she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy?

""They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,"" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother.

""We are scared of what the future holds,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

So what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid.

But according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them.

It's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity ""to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.""

The source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and ""took a while to restart.""

What's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback.

""The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,"" the source says.

Sponsor Message

The government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit.

So even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs.

""People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,"" the former PEPFAR employee said. ""But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.""

""There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,"" says Oluoch. ""They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.""

In response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that ""PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries.

""All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.""

Erick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government.

""I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,"" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024.

Haunted by a member's death

The women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills.

Rose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are.

Her husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS.

Jack is HIV positive as well. ""I have also been taking my drugs from health center,"" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad.

""I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,"" he says.

Naomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs.

Like most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods.

Adding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, ""My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,"" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills.

""It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,"" she says.

Akoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive.

It is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband.

Theresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. ""The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,"" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties.

And it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. ""Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,"" she says. ""The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.""

Cash aid from table banking

Justine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other.

""We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,"" she says.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

""Table banking"" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs.

They meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income.

Alice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need.

But she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. ""The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,"" says Amonde.

toggle caption Julia Gunther for NPR

In spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors.

Yet it can be hard to hold on to hope.

""We are living a daily nightmare,"" says Rebbeccah Atieno. ""Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.""

Alleged Torture in Tanzania

Two activists from Uganda and Kenya said on Monday that they were sexually assaulted by Tanzanian security forces while detained in the country last month. The two traveled to the country in May to attend the trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu in the capital, Dar es Salaam. The allegations come as Tanzania cracks down on dissent ahead of an October general election, in which Lissu hopes to run. He is being tried on several charges, including treason.

Agather Atuhaire of Uganda and Boniface Mwangi of Kenya were arrested at their hotel on May 19 before being driven to an unknown location, where they say they were tortured and “subjected to unimaginable cruelty” until May 23, according to Amnesty International. Following their detention, the activists said that officials dumped them near their countries’ borders with the country.

Atuhaire said that she was stripped, raped, and smeared with excrement. The entire ordeal was filmed—“to humiliate, instill fear, but also [to] silence you,” she told AFP. “[But] I am not that victim … I am not the one who should be ashamed.” Back home, Atuhaire has also campaigned against the nearly 40-year rule of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

Atuhaire’s and Mwangi’s cases were not isolated events. Former Kenyan Justice Minister Martha Karua was detained at the Dar es Salaam airport on May 19 and subsequently deported from Tanzania; she also sought to attend Lissu’s trial. Karua accused Tanzania’s government of “subverting the law to lock up the main contenders so that they can sail through unopposed” in the election.

“[L]et them not come here to meddle. Let’s not give them a chance,” Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan said at a May 19 event, speaking about activists from other East African countries seeking to visit Tanzania. “I have seen clips circulating on social media criticizing my approach,” she added, “but it is my responsibility to uphold and protect the constitution.”

Lissu leads Tanzania’s main opposition party, Chadema. He was arrested in April after calling for Tanzanians to boycott the October vote; he argued that the elections could not be free or fair as long as Samia directly appoints members of Tanzania’s National Electoral Commission. Lissu has also demanded electoral reforms.

Chadema was subsequently banned from participating in the contest, and Lissu was charged with treason and sedition. The Electoral Commission said that Chadema was barred because it had failed to sign an electoral code of conduct.

Influential Christian faith leaders have faced similar crackdowns for joining calls for electoral reforms. “Arresting people and detaining them does not silence the people’s grievances; it only deepens the divisions and drives people further apart,” Jacob Mameo Ole Paul, an Evangelical Lutheran bishop, said last month.

On Monday, armed police shut down a church in Dar es Salaam after its leader criticized a recent spate of politically motivated abductions. Chadema activist Mdude Nyagali was abducted on May 2 by unidentified assailants; his whereabouts remain unknown. And Lissu survived an assassination attempt in 2017 and then spent several years in exile before returning to Tanzania in 2020.

Samia took office in March 2021 as a transitional leader to finish the term of President John Magufuli, whom many believe died from COVID-19. She earned praise from international rights groups in her first term for her pandemic response and expansion of political freedoms. But critics say that Samia has adopted Magufuli’s authoritarian tactics to ensure her reelection.

Tanzania restricted social media access in May after hackers targeted government accounts on X. Last year, Samia’s administration temporarily suspended online licensing for three major newspapers after they published a cartoon that criticized her over rising forced disappearances in the country. Samia’s Chama Cha Mapinduzi party has governed Tanzania for more than five decades.

Lissu appeared in court on Monday, chanting Chadema’s slogan, “No reforms, No election.” His lawyers have asked the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for help ensuring his release, but the group’s advisory opinions cannot be legally enforced.

The Week Ahead

What We’re Watching

Western Sahara’s status. The United Kingdom this week joined the United States, France, and Spain in recognizing Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. During a visit to Morocco on Sunday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that he considered the country’s 2007 autonomy proposal “the most credible, viable, and pragmatic basis” for resolving a decades-old dispute over the territory.

The Western Sahara conflict dates back nearly 50 years, to when Spain relinquished territory that it occupied in what was known as Spanish Sahara. Both Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front lay claim to the region, with the latter group seeking independence.

Until recently, most countries abided by a U.N.-backed cease-fire that would see the territory’s fate determined by a future referendum. The French, Spanish, and U.K. announcements have come as Morocco builds a $1.2 billion port in Western Sahara; the statements seemed designed to boost economic ties with Rabat.

The future of Africom. Last week, the United States and Kenya co-hosted a Nairobi meeting of the annual African Chiefs of Defense Conference, which was attended by senior military officials from 37 African countries.

Speaking to reporters in Kenya, U.S. Africa Command (Africom) head Gen. Michael Langley said that networks affiliated with the Islamic State and al Qaeda in the junta-led nations of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali were attempting to gain access to coastal countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast.

“This puts not just African nations at risk, but also increases the chance of threats reaching the U.S. shores,” Langley said.

Under President Donald Trump, the United States is considering merging Africom with its European counterpart to cut bureaucracy, but Langley did not comment specifically on the proposed merger.

Langley has warned that China is “trying to replicate” programs in Africa that were administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. “They’re trying to match what we do. So that’s what we’re seeing as we start to fold in the capabilities of USAID under [the] State Department,” he said to the U.S. Senate in April. “Those capabilities are needed for the U.S. to maintain a strategic advantage over the Chinese Communist Party.”

Arrest in Kenya. Kenyans have denounced the arrest on Friday of Rose Njeri, a software developer who built an app for Kenyans to share views opposing a controversial finance bill that was recently proposed by the government.

Njeri’s site, known as Civic Email, allowed users to directly send their objections to the bill to government departments. Njeri was charged on Tuesday under the controversial 2018 Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act and then released on bail.

The Kenyan government says that the finance bill will increase state revenue by amending various tax laws, including in real estate and digital services. But opponents say the measure will raise the cost of living and erase privacy rights by limiting citizens’ data protections.

Last year, a previous iteration of the bill led to monthlong protests, forcing President William Ruto to withdraw the legislation before its reintroduction this year.

Nigeria’s floods. As of Sunday, flooding caused by heavy rainfall in the central Nigerian town of Mokwa in Niger State had killed more than 200 people and displaced more than 3,000 from their homes. Officials warned that the actual death toll is likely to be higher. Torrential rains started last Wednesday and continued into Thursday.

Nigeria is prone to flooding, in part due to poor drainage infrastructure. The country’s rainy season lasts about six months and began this year in April. Scientists have warned that Nigeria is vulnerable to extreme weather from climate change, including prolonged drought followed by heavy rains.

This Week in Money

Former Mauritanian Finance Minister Sidi Ould Tah was elected on Thursday to head the African Development Bank (ADB). He will take office at a critical time for the continent’s main infrastructure lender.

The United States is the bank’s third-largest shareholder, after Nigeria and Egypt. But Trump has proposed cutting $555 million in support for the ADB, arguing that the bank was “not currently aligned” with his administration’s priorities.

Ould Tah beat four other candidates competing for the job, gaining 76 percent of votes in the third round of the leadership selection contest. He previously served as president of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa for a decade, from 2015 to 2025. His predecessor at the ADB, Nigeria’s Akinwumi Adesina, said that the bank’s capital stands at $318 billion.

At its annual meeting last week, the bank also announced that it would launch an Africa Carbon Support Facility to help governments regulate carbon trading and to boost the supply and demand of carbon credits. The carbon credits would allow foreign companies to offset their emissions in their own countries by planting trees or putting up wind farms in Africa.

Carbon credits are not without controversy, however: Rights groups allege that the industry has furthered land grabs and the displacement of Indigenous populations across Africa. Scientists also say that carbon credits do not reduce emissions and often harm biodiversity.

FP’s Most Read This Week

What We’re Reading

Trump rewrites history. Ghanaian President John Mahama argued in the Guardian last week that Trump’s unfounded claim of white genocide in South Africa “was an insult to all Africans.” Trump is employing historical revisionism to undermine and erase the violence of apartheid, Mahama wrote.

“It is not enough to be affronted by these claims, or to casually dismiss them as untruths. These statements are a clear example of how language can be leveraged to extend the effects of previous injustices,” Mahama wrote. “And it cannot simply be met with silence—not any more.”

Libyan power grab. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh’s heads one of the country’s two rival governments, the U.N.-backed administration in Tripoli. But Dbeibeh’s recent moves to strengthen his government’s position against rival militias culminated in heavy gunfire in the capital last month.

In New Lines Magazine, Emadeddin Badi and Wolfram Lacher argue that by “mobilizing against what they portray as a … power grab, the government’s adversaries are inadvertently shoring up” Dbeibeh’s “faltering support in his hometown.”",2025-06-04T05:00:27Z,http://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/04/tanzania-activists-arrest-elections-security-forces-torture-allegations/,

Our “Heads Up” Work

We’ve worked to improve our research insights over the last year by taking a more “heads up” approach—networking with more experts, going on more site visits, incorporating more local knowledge into our analyses. We often say that “reality is complicated,” and we know that spreadsheets and models alone can’t capture the whole story.

This effort is already paying off in meaningful ways. As part of our ongoing work to identify gaps resulting from USAID cuts, our malaria chemoprevention research team was able to quickly contact country-based representatives from multiple organizations who offered candid perspectives on the funding landscape and potential implementers as we investigated a potential grant. These conversations ultimately led us to fund a different organization than we had originally considered, and we’re confident that this decision was better informed as a result.

Another recent example comes from our malaria vector control research team. This spring, they attended the Alliance for Malaria Prevention Annual Partners Meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, which brings together funders, technical experts, and program implementers from around the world working in the malaria net space. In light of recent cuts to US foreign assistance, the meeting offered an opportunity to engage new partners and strengthen existing relationships at a critical moment. These connections deepen our understanding of the evolving challenges in the field, surface insights we might not otherwise access, and help ensure our research remains grounded in real-world implementation.

Our researchers also have several site visits planned for this year, including trips to see programs in action in Côte d’Ivoire, India, Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. Traveling to areas where the programs we fund operate helps us understand realities and challenges that our research might otherwise miss. We’re continuing to invest in this type of work as an important complement to our desk research, and we’re encouraged by the results we’re seeing as we integrate the approaches.

The traditional dominance of the US in shaping trade and aid policies is receding, creating both peril and possibility for African nations. Recent disruptions—from protectionist tariffs launched in Washington to the outsized influence of tech billionaires—have exposed how vulnerable Africa’s economies remain to external decisions. The once-stable antagonistic cooperation between Washington and Beijing, which long shaped the contours of the global order, now appears to be waning. Yet these shocks are also spurring a long-overdue conversation about self-reliance and sovereignty. Can Africa turn a decline in US influence into an opportunity to chart its own course, or will new dependencies simply replace the old ones? US President Donald Trump’s trade wars epitomize the jolts to the system. His administration’s sweeping tariffs did not stop at China—they struck African countries as well, abruptly undercutting the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which for two decades had given African exporters preferential access to US markets. The effects were immediate and painful. In Lesotho, for instance, a flourishing garment industry that depended on tariff-free exports to American retailers suddenly faced levies of up to 50% on its goods. Thousands of factory workers—mostly women—saw their jobs put at risk overnight as orders evaporated and profit margins vanished. In Kenya, flower farmers braced for a 10% tariff hike on horticultural exports, threatening to price them out of the market. These were not mere economic policy shifts—they struck at the livelihoods of households and communities that had pinned their hopes on global trade. Trump’s tariffs on African countries reached as high as 50% on goods from Lesotho, with steep duties also hitting Madagascar, Mauritius, and others. Industries painstakingly built under AGOA’s duty-free framework were thrown into crisis. For African policymakers, the tariff shock was a rude awakening. It exposed how fragile the continent’s place in global trade truly is when a single policy reversal in Washington can upend entire sectors. “Can we continue to rely on the US, or is it time to find a path of our own?” became the question animating high-level discussions across the continent. The call for diversification grew louder. For decades, Africa’s development strategy had been anchored to ties with the US and Europe—ties that now revealed themselves to be tenuous, even illusory. Trump’s protectionism, though damaging in the immediate term, has forced a reckoning: Africa must reduce its overreliance on any single foreign market. If the status quo can no longer be taken for granted, then perhaps this moment of crisis might also serve as a catalyst to imagine a more independent economic future.

When billionaires shape foreign policy Trade is only one side of the coin. Even as African nations grappled with tariff whiplash, a new challenge to their sovereignty has emerged—driven by powerful private actors like Elon Musk, the tech magnate-turned-policymaker. Under the auspices of a Trump-era initiative tellingly dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk spearheaded an aggressive campaign to slash what he considered “wasteful” federal spending, including US foreign aid. In an unprecedented arrangement, the billionaire was effectively handed the reins to remold parts of the US government’s role abroad. One of Musk’s prime targets, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has long provided development assistance to African countries. Musk’s cost-cutting crusade quickly translated into severe aid reductions. Programs that had been funding health clinics, schools, and infrastructure across Africa were abruptly scaled back or terminated. The consequences have been dire. In March, the World Health Organization warned that the US decision to “pause” foreign aid deliveries had “substantially disrupted” the supply of HIV/AIDS medications in at least eight countries, including Kenya, Lesotho, and South Sudan—nations that could run out of life-saving treatments within months. Decades of progress against the HIV epidemic now risk unraveling, with officials fearing as many as 10 million additional infections and three million deaths if these disruptions continue. In Uganda, which relies heavily on US-funded HIV programs, clinics have already begun rationing antiretroviral drugs—a grim step backward into crisis. These cuts are more than just numbers on a budget sheet; they are measured in human lives, as the US retreat from foreign aid, led by Trump and Musk, has gutted support for some of the most vulnerable populations. What makes this scenario especially unsettling for Africa is the erosion of accountability that comes with private influence over public policy. Musk is an unelected actor wielding outsized power: decisions made in a Silicon Valley boardroom—or an Oval Office backchannel—can determine whether a village clinic in Mali stays open, a clean water project in Kenya dries up, or maternal health programs in Ethiopia are shuttered. This trend, in which billionaire “diplomats” shape the destinies of nations, raises urgent questions about democratic oversight and sovereignty. Who ultimately holds the reins when development priorities can be reset on a whim by corporate titans? For African states used to negotiating with official departments and diplomats, the new paradigm is disorienting. It’s no longer just Washington’s whims they must navigate, but those of individuals operating far outside any diplomatic framework. Musk’s influence is a harbinger of a world where private wealth dictates the terms of global governance—often sidelining the governments of the very countries most affected. The convergence of Trump’s tariff nationalism and Musk’s corporate-driven agenda lays bare a hard truth: Africa’s economic fortunes are still far too subject to decisions made elsewhere, for interests other than Africa’s own. Whether it’s a US president pursuing an “America First” trade policy or a tech CEO advancing a technocratic vision of efficiency, the result for Africa is the same: loss of agency. Each has challenged African leaders to ask: Are we masters of our own fate, or merely pawns in someone else’s game? Yet amid these challenges, a cautious sense of empowerment is emerging. By exposing the pitfalls of dependence, Trump and Musk may have inadvertently done Africa a favor. They have made it impossible to ignore the structural vulnerabilities that have long been apparent. As one pillar of external support after another collapses, African nations are being forced to accelerate conversations about self-sufficiency and regional integration that have simmered for years.

New partners, old risks If the US is stepping back—or pushing Africa away—who will fill the void? One obvious answer is China. In the past two decades, China’s presence in Africa has grown from a curiosity to a cornerstone of the continent’s external relations. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing has poured money into highways in Kenya, railways in Ethiopia, ports in Tanzania, and beyond. For many African governments, China’s willingness to finance big-ticket infrastructure has been a godsend, especially as Western aid and investment waver. In the wake of Trump’s tariff shock, analysts predicted that Beijing would waste no time presenting itself as a more stable, “rules-based” partner—one that wouldn’t yank away market access on short notice. China has long emphasized its commitment to consistent engagement, a message likely to push countries even closer to its orbit. But if US influence came with strings, so too does China’s. Critics warn that BRI projects can devolve into “debt-trap diplomacy,” a new form of economic subjugation by another name. The formula is familiar: Chinese state banks offer huge loans for infrastructure, African states eagerly accept, and when repayment becomes impossible, Beijing gains leverage—whether in the form of control over strategic assets or greater influence over domestic policymaking. Already, countries like Zambia and Sri Lanka—a cautionary tale outside Africa—have struggled with unsustainable debt linked to Chinese funding. Critics argue the BRI functions as a development scheme that saddles countries with unaffordable loans, leaving them vulnerable to coercion and weakening their sovereignty. From an African perspective, the picture is more nuanced. Leaders like South African President Cyril Ramaphosa have pushed back on the “debt trap” narrative, arguing that Chinese investment, if managed prudently, fills crucial development gaps and that African states are not passive victims. Chinese capital has indeed built roads, power grids, and other infrastructure where it was desperately needed. And unlike Western aid, it often comes with fewer lectures on governance or human rights. Still, the long-term implications must be weighed. Who owns the mines and minerals after the deals are signed? Are local workers and businesses benefiting, or just foreign contractors? If a railway is built with Chinese loans and operated by a Chinese firm, how much of the profit stays in Africa? These questions strike at the heart of sovereignty: can Africa truly be sovereign if its most critical assets are externally controlled, whether by Washington or Beijing? The same caution applies to other emerging partners. For example, India, Turkey, and the Gulf states have also increased trade and investment across Africa in recent years. They offer African governments more diplomatic options and the promise of diversified economic ties. In theory, this competition for African markets could increase African leverage—a chance to play suitors off one another for better terms. But in practice, it could also become a race to the bottom. Without clear-eyed strategies and strong negotiating positions, African nations risk simply replacing one set of extractive arrangements with another. Ultimately, diversifying external relationships—whether through trade deals with Asia or South-South cooperation—is a necessary strategy, but not a sufficient one. True autonomy won’t come from swapping patrons. It will come from reducing the need for patrons altogether.

The promise of AfCFTA and regional integration One bright avenue for reducing external dependence is strengthening ties within Africa itself. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), operational since 2021, is an ambitious project aiming to knit together 54 African countries into a single market of 1.4 billion people with a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion. It represents Africa’s boldest effort yet to boost intra-continental commerce, which currently makes up only about 15% of Africa’s trade, compared to over 60% in Asia and 70% in Europe. The logic is straightforward: if African countries trade more with each other, they will be less beholden to external markets. A more self-contained African economy could better withstand global shocks—whether financial crises, pandemics, or the whims of foreign leaders—because it would spread risk across a broader internal base. Early analyses of AfCFTA’s potential are encouraging. The World Bank estimates that by 2035, full implementation of AfCFTA could raise Africa’s exports by 32% and lift tens of millions of people out of poverty. It could also make the continent far more attractive to investment in manufacturing and services, as companies tap into economies of scale beyond their home country. In short, AfCFTA aspires to do nothing less than reconfigure the African economy—shifting it from an exporter of raw commodities into a diversified production base serving African consumers. Over time, this could help break the historic pattern where Africa sends out unprocessed minerals and crops and buys back finished goods at a premium, a cycle that has perpetuated underdevelopment since colonial times. However, turning the paper agreements of AfCFTA into real commerce on the ground is a formidable challenge. Infrastructure gaps are a major bottleneck—you can’t trade if you can’t transport goods efficiently from an inland factory to a port or land border. Many African countries still lack reliable roads, railways, and electricity to support industrial growth. Customs procedures and regulatory standards need harmonization to ease the passage of goods. And some countries remain wary that opening up their markets might undercut local industries in the short term. Implementing AfCFTA will require not just political will but also significant investment in connectivity and competitiveness. It is encouraging that even amidst these concerns, regional blocs and governments are actively working on these issues—from new cross-border highway projects to unified customs protocols. The direction is clear: Africa sees regional integration as key to its economic future, even if the journey will be long.

Beyond dependency Whether dealing with Washington, Beijing, or any other capital, one theme becomes apparent: Africa’s leverage will ultimately depend on its internal strength. Diversifying trade partners and signing new deals can only go so far if underlying vulnerabilities persist. The most fundamental question is one Africans are increasingly posing to themselves: What would it take to truly stand on our own feet? The answers usually begin at home. Stronger institutions, better infrastructure, and skilled human capital are the foundation of any self-sufficient economy. For Africa to negotiate as an equal on the world stage, it needs capable states that can deliver public goods and foster an environment where domestic and foreign businesses can thrive. This means tackling everything from corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency to gaps in education and technology. It means investing in roads, ports, power grids, and internet bandwidth that connect African producers with African consumers. It also means nurturing local entrepreneurship and industry, so that value is added within Africa rather than overseas. As long as African countries primarily export raw minerals or crude oil and import the finished electronics, machinery, and processed foods they consume, they will remain at the mercy of external price swings and foreign suppliers. Consider the stark reality: many African economies are still overly dependent on a narrow range of commodity exports—whether it’s oil in Nigeria, copper in Zambia, coffee in Ethiopia, or cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire. This makes them extremely vulnerable to global market fluctuations and leaves them with little bargaining power. Breaking out of that pattern requires deliberate strategy. Governments might, for example, incentivize the growth of local agro-processing industries, so coffee and cashew nuts are roasted and packaged in Africa rather than exported raw. Or they might invest in mineral refining and battery manufacturing at home to climb up the value chain from just mining cobalt or lithium. Some of this is already happening: Rwanda and Ghana have begun processing more of their minerals locally, and Kenya has nurtured a booming tech sector dubbed the “Silicon Savannah.” But scaling these successes across the continent is the challenge ahead. Reimagining Africa’s role in the global economy also requires a shift in mindset. For too long, the focus has been on attracting foreign aid and foreign investment as the primary drivers of development. This often meant tailoring policies to please donors or multinational corporations, sometimes at the expense of nurturing domestic capacity. Now, a new generation of thinkers and leaders is emphasizing build your own over beggar thy neighbor—the essence being that aid can only ever be a stopgap; real wealth comes from productive economies, not perpetual assistance. This perspective doesn’t reject globalization; rather, it seeks to engage on Africa’s terms. It’s about creating the conditions where African nations can engage in trade not as junior partners competing mainly on low wages or raw materials, but as equal players offering competitive industries and innovation. None of this is easy. The road to true economic sovereignty is long and complex, and progress will be measured in years, if not decades. There will be setbacks and compromises. In the near term, African governments must still contend with external pressures—whether it’s negotiating debt relief with Chinese banks, haggling over trade terms with Europe, or managing the fallout of US policy shifts. Globalization is not going away, and interdependence is a reality. The goal, however, is to reshape that interdependence into a healthier form—one where Africa is not a passive recipient but an active shaper of global norms and networks. What might that look like in practice? It could include steps such as strengthening governance and the rule of law to ensure that agreements are transparent and resources—whether aid or revenue—are managed responsibly, reducing opportunities for foreign exploitation of instability. Investing in education and skills would equip Africa’s massive youth population to drive the industries of the future, from agribusiness and manufacturing to digital services, rather than relying on expatriate expertise. Developing critical infrastructure—such as highways, ports, rail corridors, and power pools—would prioritize projects that connect African economies to each other and enable local businesses to become more competitive. Fostering entrepreneurship and innovation by supporting small and medium enterprises, start-ups, and research could unlock homegrown solutions and diversify the economic base. These initiatives, many of which are underway to varying degrees, would help build a resilient foundation. Only on such a foundation can Africa truly mitigate the whims of external forces—be it a trade war, an aid cutoff, or a global recession.",2025-06-04T12:14:54Z,https://africasacountry.com/2025/06/between-washington-and-beijing/,

+ Football Association bars trans women from women’s soccer after court ruling

Starting June 1, trans women will be banned from playing in women’s soccer leagues in England, following a ruling by the UK Supreme Court that alters the legal definition of “woman” to being based on “biological sex.” The Football Association (FA) said the policy shift was legally required and will apply across both amateur and professional levels.

The ruling has prompted other UK sports bodies to follow suit. The Scottish FA has announced a similar restriction for the upcoming season, aligning with a broader global trend that has seen World Athletics and World Aquatics organizations impose bans on trans women in elite women’s sports.

LGBTQ+ advocates, including Pride Sports, condemned the decision as discriminatory, noting that fewer than 30 trans women currently play in UK women’s leagues, without issue. “Within weeks, they will lose not just their familiar place in football but the many physical and mental health benefits that come from being part of a welcoming team environment,” the group stated.

One Africa’s leading electric vehicle (EV) companies, Spiro, has launched an all–women assembly line in Togo–a groundbreaking move for the African EV industry. Women will now lead daily motor and charger production, receiving specialized training in manufacturing. In a sector historically dominated by men, Sprio’s initiative not only breaks the barriers, but paves the way for greater inclusivity in tech and manufacturing.

“This initiative underscores Spiro’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and women’s empowerment while addressing Africa’s urgent infrastructure needs for electric mobility,” the company told the Kenya Times.

South Korea

+ Samsung under fire for failing women in the boardroom

Samsung is facing mounting criticism over its failure to appoint women to leadership roles, with shareholders calling out the company at its annual meeting for having no female internal board members. Only two women serve as external directors, highlighting the stark gender gap in one of South Korea’s most powerful corporations.

The tech giant is not alone. Among South Korea’s 30 largest companies, there are just 25 women directors in total. Hyundai named its first female internal director only in 2021, and LG Electronics has none. The country ranks second-to-last in the OECD’s 2025 “glass ceiling index,” above only Japan.

Women in South Korea face persistent discrimination even when applying for ordinary jobs. CNN recently reported a hiring manager telling a female applicant, “Women aren’t fit to work in sales.”

Samsung, meanwhile, has focused on initiatives like foreign language training and its Generation17 partnership with the UN, which supports youth-led work on global issues including gender equality. But critics say symbolic perks and CSR programs can’t substitute for real structural change in corporate governance.

Iran

+ 2024 femicide report shows surge in violence

StopFemicideIran (SFI) has released a preview of its 2024 report, exposing a troubling surge in femicides across Iran. The report offers a detailed analysis of the victims, methods of violence used and the societal factors fueling these crimes. Launched in 2020 by the Alliance for Rights of All Minorities in the wake of 14-year-old Romina Ashrafi’s murder, SFI seeks to raise global awareness about the ongoing crisis of violence against women in Iran.

The 26-page report documents a staggering 172 femicides—marking a 16 percent increase from the previous year. This translates to one murder approximately every other day, and includes 31 state-sponsored executions of women. Over one-third of the victims were between the ages of 15 and 35, with the youngest just two months old. The report also underscores the brutal nature of many of these killings and the alarming frequency of violence perpetrated within families.

SFI also highlighted the devastating impact on children and communities left behind. Through documentation, education and grassroots empowerment, the initiative aims to combat femicide and promote women’s rights in Iran. “We must continue to work together to break the cycle of violence and ensure that these women’s lives are not forgotten,” said Marjan Keypour, founder and director of StopFemicideIran.

United Arab Emirates

+ Region’s first all-female supercar club breaks stereotypes on the open road

In a region long seen as a man’s world when it comes to cars, the Arabian Gazelles are rewriting the rules. Founded in 2017 by Hanan Mazouzi Sobati, the UAE-based club is the Middle East’s first all-women supercar owners group — high-performance luxury cars built for speed and spectacle — and it’s growing fast. Earlier this month, 30 women from the UAE and beyond hit the highways in a four-day rally across the Emirates, driving Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and McLarens.

Mazouzi Sobati, a lifelong car enthusiast, created the club to challenge the automotive world’s exclusion of women. She said she was tired of brands only inviting men to track days and promotional events — often sending invitations to her husband, not her. “We don’t wait for a seat at the table,” she said. “If the seat is not available, we create the table and we all sit.”

Despite early resistance from car companies, perceptions are shifting. BMW recently invited the group to test-drive vehicles on a racetrack.

The club’s mission goes beyond horsepower. It’s about visibility, autonomy, and belonging. “We want people to stop assuming there’s always a man behind the wheel of a supercar,” Sobati said. For many members, the Gazelles offer not just adrenaline — but empowerment.

Dominican Republic

+ History making bill introduced to reform the DR’s 139-year-old penal code

Dominican Republic Senator Antonio Tavéras Guzmán has introduced a landmark bill to revise the country’s 1884 penal code, proposing exceptions to the country’s total abortion ban in cases of rape, incest, nonviable pregnancies, or threats to the mother’s life. The bill also expands protections for LGBTQ+ individuals and strengthens support for victims of gender-based violence, child abuse and human trafficking.

Currently, abortion is fully criminalized in the DR, with women and girls facing incarceration for seeking care. Taveras’ proposal comes as four competing revisions threaten to maintain the ban, impose harsher penalties—including prison terms of up to 30 years—and weaken protections against gender-based violence and discrimination.

With maternal mortality and teen pregnancy rates among the highest in the region, and abortion the third leading cause of maternal death in the country, the stakes have never been higher. Far-right lawmakers, encouraged by conservative U.S. allies, are aggressively pushing to entrench the current restrictions.

Hundreds of organizations, united under the National Popular Coordinator, the Citizen Forum, and the Coalition for Life and Women’s Rights, have voiced their support for the proposed Penal Code reforms.

Sudan

+ Sudan’s paramilitary’s forces are weaponizing sexual violence

Amnesty International has accused Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of using sexual violence, including gang rape, as a tactic of war amid the country’s ongoing conflict. In a newly released 30-page report, the organization details how RSF fighters have weaponized sexual violence to terrorize and control displaced communities.

The brutal civil war between Sudan’s RSF and the state’s army has lasted nearly two years, killing tens of thousands and displacing over 11 million people. Amnesty found evidence of war crimes committed on both sides, with women and girls suffering widespread sexual violence.

Amnesty interviewed 30 people for the report, many now living in Ugandan refugee camps, who consistently identified RSF fighters as their attackers. Survivors described the profound physical and psychological trauma inflicted, as well as the devastating, lasting toll on their lives, although urgent medical care remains a critical need, cuts to USAID-funded programs have severely restricted access to essential sexual health services.

“The international response to the suffering of Sudanese women and girls has been reprehensible,”said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact. “The world must act to stop the RSF’s atrocities by stemming the flow of weapons into Sudan, pressuring the leadership to end sexual violence, and holding perpetrators including top commanders to account.”

Greece

+ Greece joins call for first female UN Secretary-General

Greece has publicly thrown its support behind the idea of a woman leading the United Nations, saying the “tide is for a woman” as the race to replace António Guterres in 2026 begins to stir. Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris, speaking as Greece assumed the rotating presidency of the Security Council in May, told PassBlue that while male candidates may still apply, “the time is long overdue” for a female Secretary-General.

Sekeris also championed the Women, Peace and Security agenda, emphasizing its strategic value amid global instability. Greece is the latest in a growing list of nations voicing support for gender parity in the UN’s highest post, which has never been held by a woman in its 80-year history.

His remarks come as part of what he called a “European spring” at the Council, with Denmark, France, Slovenia, and now Greece forming a rare show of EU unity. While the five permanent members retain veto power, elected members like Greece are increasingly vocal in shaping the institution’s future direction.

The call for a woman leader resonates with advocates pushing for change across the UN system, especially after the General Assembly adopted gender parity targets and amid pressure to make top roles more inclusive. Whether this momentum translates into actual nominations remains to be seen — but the diplomatic drumbeat is growing louder.",2025-05-14T20:47:43Z,https://msmagazine.com/2025/05/14/ms-global-england-bars-trans-women-from-womens-soccer-iran-sees-surge-in-femicides-and-more/,

The other twin is gone, a casualty of malnutrition and the international funding cuts that are snapping the lifeline for displaced communities in Nigeria’s insurgency-ravaged Borno state.

“Feeding is severely difficult,” said Bulama, 40, who was a farmer before Boko Haram militants swept through her village, forcing her to flee. She and about 400,000 other people at the humanitarian hub of Dikwa — virtually the entire population — rely on assistance. The military restricts their movements to a designated “safe zone,” which severely limits farming.

For years, the United States Agency for International Development had been the backbone of the humanitarian response in northeastern Nigeria, helping non-government organizations provide food, shelter and healthcare to millions of people. But this year, the Trump administration cut more than 90% of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance around the world.

Programs serving children were hit hard.

Bulama previously lost young triplets to hunger before reaching therapeutic feeding centers in Dikwa. When she gave birth to twins last August, both were severely underweight. Workers from Mercy Corps enrolled them in a program to receive a calorie-dense paste used to treat severe acute malnutrition.

But in February, Mercy Corps abruptly ended the program that was entirely financed by USAID. Two weeks later, one of the twins died, Bulama said.

She has no more tears, only dread for what may come next.

“I don’t want to bury another child,” she said.

‘Very traumatic’

Globally, 50% of the therapeutic foods for treating malnutrition in children were funded by USAID, and 40% of the supplies were produced in the U.S., according to Shawn Baker, chief program officer at Helen Keller Intl and former chief nutritionist at USAID.

He said the consequence could be 1 million children not receiving treatment for severe malnutrition, resulting in 163,500 additional deaths per year. For Helen Keller Intl, its programs in Bangladesh, Nepal and Nigeria have been terminated.

“It is very traumatic,” said Trond Jensen, the head of the United Nations humanitarian office in Maiduguri, Borno’s capital, of the funding cuts, noting that other donors, including the European Union, have taken similar steps this year. “One of the things is the threat to the lives of children.”

UNICEF still runs a therapeutic feeding center nearby, which now supports Bulama’s surviving baby, but its capacity is stretched. It is turning away many people previously served by other aid groups that have pulled out due to funding cuts.

Intersos, an Italian humanitarian organization, has the only remaining facility providing in-patient services for malnutrition in Dikwa, treating the most perilous cases. Its workers say they are overwhelmed, with at least 10 new admissions of seriously malnourished children daily.

“Before the USAID cut, we made a lot of progress,” said Ayuba Kauji, a health and nutrition supervisor. “Now my biggest worry is high mortality. We don’t have enough resources to keep up.”

Intersos was forced to reduce its staff from 30 to 11 in Dikwa after the USAID freeze. Its nutrition and health facilities now operate solely on support from the Nigerian Humanitarian Fund, a smaller pot of money contributed by a few European countries. That funding will be finished in June.

The crisis is equally acute in Maiduguri, where the economy is reeling from massive terminations of aid workers. At another Intersos-run facility, 10 of the 12 doctors have left and four nurses remain, with 50 new admissions of malnourished children per week.

“It used to be far less,” said Emmanuel Ali, one of the remaining doctors.

Beyond nutrition

The effects of the funding cuts extend far beyond nutrition. At the International Organization for Migration’s reception center in Dikwa, thousands of displaced families and those escaping Boko Haram captivity are stranded. There are no new shelters being built and no support for relocation.

“Before, organizations like Mercy Corps built mud-brick homes and rehabilitated damaged shelters to absorb people from the IOM reception center,” said one official at the center, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the situation. “Now, that has stopped.”

Jensen, the U.N. humanitarian head in Maiduguri, said, “sadly, we are not seeing additional funding to make up for the U.S. cuts.” He warned that vulnerable people could turn to risky ways of coping, including joining violent groups.

A global problem

The crisis in Nigeria is part of a larger reckoning. According to Kate Phillips-Barrasso, Mercy Corps’ vice president for policy and advocacy, 40 of its 62 U.S.-funded programs with the potential to reach 3.5 million people in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Lebanon and Gaza have been terminated.

In Mozambique, where jihadist violence in the north has displaced over a million people since 2017, humanitarian organizations face steep shortfalls with “devastating” effects on the needy, said Frederico João, chairman of the forum of NGOs in the region.

More widely, the USAID funding cut compromises Mozambique’s health sector, especially in HIV/AIDS care, said Inocêncio Impissa, cabinet spokesman. The government now seeks alternative funding to prevent total collapse of health systems.

US billionaire Bill Gates on Tuesday announced that the majority of his philanthropic Gates Foundation's $200 billion (€175 billion) endowment will be spent in Africa over the next two decades.

Gates, who on May 8 said he would wind down the foundation by 2045, made the pledge while addressing African leaders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

""I recently made a commitment that my wealth will be given away over the next 20 years. The majority of that funding will be spent on helping you address challenges here in Africa,"" Gates said as he urged leaders to boost health and development through partnership and innovation.

""By unleashing human potential through health and education, every country in Africa should be on a path to prosperity… and that path is an exciting thing to be part of,"" Gates told government officials, diplomats and health workers.

Gates makes pitch as US government slashes aid

""Investing in primary healthcare has the greatest impact on health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""With primary healthcare, what we've learned is that helping the mother be healthy and have great nutrition before she gets pregnant, while she is pregnant, delivers the strongest results. Ensuring the child receives good nutrition in their first four years as well makes all the difference.""

US businessman-philanthropist Gates singled out Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe as examples of countries that to his mind show strong leadership fostering innovation. He did not comment on allegations of authoritarianism and rights abuses against the governments of, for example, Ethiopia and Rwanda.

""Our foundation has an increasing commitment to Africa,"" Gates said. ""Our first African office was here in Ethiopia about 13 years ago. Now we have offices in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal. That's a great way for us to strengthen partnerships.""

Gates' pitch comes amid halts to US foreign aid on the advice of US President Donald Trump's donor and budget oversight advisor, Elon Musk — the world's richest man — who bragged of ""feeding USAID to the wood chipper.""

A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet projected that cuts to American spending on PEPFAR — the program to deliver HIV and AIDS relief abroad — could cost the lives of 500,000 children by 2030. The journal Nature suggested a sustained halt to US aid funding could result in some 25 million additional deaths over 15 years.

The Gates Foundation has invested heavily in projects aimed at reducing childhood and maternal deaths; advancing progress on vaccines for infectious disease, such as malaria or HIV; as well as lifting poor populations out of poverty.

The foundation claims that it has contributed to more than 100 innovations that have saved more than 80 million lives, citing partnerships with GAVI and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

More than meets the eye?

Despite his philanthropy, Gates has many critics around the world, increasingly so in Africa. Observers accuse him of trying to expand his economic and political power in the guise of charity. The US journalist Tim Schwab, who wrote The Bill Gates Problem, sees him as a representing philanthrocapitalism, a way of doing philanthropy similarly to how business is done for profit.

A 2022 DW documentary showed how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (as the Gates Foundation used to be called) had become one of the most important promoters of genetic engineering experiments on the African continent, thus inviting criticism that it was playing into the hands of large Western agricultural corporations.

Angolan health expert Domingos Cristovao warns African countries against becoming dependent on private foundations in key areas such as health. They should build ""their own sustainable health structures"" he says, ""without relying on foreign donors.""

Gates says 'rich should do more in philanthropy'

Gates, who made his fortune with the computer software company Microsoft and started the Gates Foundation with his ex-wife, Melinda, has urged other wealthy individuals to spend their money on humanity not just personal possessions.

When recently asked by The New York Times about why he is donating his fortune he first said, ""It makes a big difference to take the money and spend it now versus later,"" pointing to its impact on developments in agriculture and AI.

""What am I going to do?"" he added, ""Just go buy a bunch of boats or something? Go gamble? This money should go back to society in the way that it has the best chance of causing something positive to happen.""

""And I do think good examples influence other people. I think the rich people today should do more philanthropy, and we have some examples of that. And I think the rich people 20 years from now should do more in philanthropy.""

While in Africa, Gates will also meet with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to talk about AI and health care reform in their respective countries.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), a silent pandemic, widens health inequalities in Africa by disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. With an estimated 255,000 attributable deaths in 2019, it is one of Africa’s leading cause of mortality. Beyond misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, the key drivers of AMR, Africa faces other unique challenges. These include inadequate Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures, poor Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), suboptimal childhood vaccination rates coupled with inadequate health systems and lack of sustainable access to essential and novel antimicrobials and diagnostics. Besides worsening AMR, these factors lead to inappropriate treatment of diseases, and treatment gaps while addressing resistant cases, pushing up mortality rates. Without appropriate, timely interventions, AMR is projected to result in millions of deaths in Africa and cause more than 5% fall in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of low-income countries, by 2050. AMR National Action Plans (NAP) have been developed as strategic documents to address the issue. However, implementation has been impeded by funding gaps as most NAPs are not funded. This is further complicated by a strained health financing landscape with drastic reduction in Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) by traditional donor countries.

AMR financing challenges in Africa

AMR is not often perceived as a development issue due to its technical framing and general lack of awareness, resulting in poor domestic funding for interventions. A study on transparency and accountability of AMR NAPs from 15 African countries showed, only one country has made some funding allocation. African countries depend heavily on the global north for the management of maternal and child health, control of infectious diseases and immunization. With the drastic external funding cuts in 2025, implementation of these programs will be affected. Further, an external debt of over $650 billion by the region is forcing nearly 40% of African countries to spend more on debt servicing than healthcare. As focus will shift to these key issues innovative approaches are needed to prioritize AMR.

Innovative financing strategies in AMR

Faced with these challenges, Africa needs to adopt innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the gaps.

Earmarked financing

In earmarked financing, different tiers of government – federal, local or both – earmark an existing or a new revenue stream for a specific cause, in this scenario it can be AMR.

AMR specific taxes and levies: At present, no African country has AMR specific taxes or any fiscal policy in place to tax commercial activities in non-human sectors such as overuse of pesticides that can cause microbial resistance. A few countries have introduced environmental taxes (e.g: carbon emissions levy in South Africa and tax on plastic bags in Senegal) which could be extended to AMR, or taxes imposed on pharmaceutical or health care facility effluents. Similarly the air ticket solidarity levy system in South Korea where approximately $1 is charged on every international flight from the country which is added to the Global Disease Eradication Fund (GDEF) – is another example that can be adopted for AMR initiatives.

Sin tax or pro health tax for AMR: It has been found that higher the tax-to-GDP ratio, the better the country’s ability to spend on public development projects. One of the ways to achieve this is by raising excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol and sugary beverages. A 50% increase in excise taxes on these items will increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 0.7%, allowing to earmark the additional income for AMR initiatives..

Policy changes on managing finances

Budgetary allocations: One of the key challenges for specific allocation, is the multi sectoral nature of AMR requiring co-ordination among ministries. A whole-of government budgeting approach can be used, where the budget prioritizes programs aligned to national goals and supplemented by periodic spending reviews. This will foster inter-ministerial collaboration, reduce inefficiencies, and improve outcomes. The performance-based budgeting by many African nations and results oriented outcome-based budgeting are some of the strategies. To prioritize AMR in this approach, lobbying is required to bring it high on national goals.

Delegated financing for AMR: The concerned ministries within a country can be lobbied to start an independent statutory organisation, similar to Joint Programme for AIDS support in Uganda, to receive funds from all sectors including private, philanthropic and international organizations, and developing agencies. If the efforts are too cumbersome, the agencies or ministries could create joint account reserved for AMR initiatives.

Development impact bonds (DIBs): Outcome-based financing instruments like DIBs have been successfully tried in poverty-related programs in Kenya and Uganda. In DIBs, private investors provide money upfront, who are compensated by outcome payers based on specific results. In AMR financing, DIBs can support investment-heavy areas like diagnostic capacity strengthening or IPC infrastructure in healthcare facilities. However, countries must be cautious of the pitfalls perceived with vaccine bonds and should put in appropriate protective measures in place.

Regional financing mechanisms

The African Union, with its tremendous convening power, can explore regional financing mechanisms to support its member nations.

Debt swap for AMR programs: In Africa, 768 million people live in countries where interest spending exceeds education or health spending. South Africa, the largest economy in Africa, is having a debt equivalent to three quarters of its entire GDP and is rising. This debt distress can be used favorably to fund AMR interventions and action plans using the debt for development swap concept. AMR should be on the table when any conversation on debt restructuring is taking place in any African nation.

African union pooled AMR fund: African Union can set up a pooled AMR fund like the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund. However, it should not fall into the trap of foreign aid dependence but should be made with the commitment and contributions from the member nations, development banks, regional economic communities and health agencies. Loans at concessional rates or performance-linked grants for AMR can come from such a fund.

Conclusion

The heavy reliance on external sources exposes the continent’s healthcare to the fluctuations and the interests of the international donors. This has led to non-alignment with local priorities, fragmented efforts, and lack of sustainable domestic financing mechanisms. To strengthen the AMR response, Africa should adopt locally driven strategies, reduce dependence on external funding and create a more resilient financing mechanism.

The Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale announced the planned shift during remarks at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on May 25.

The shift would see a range of digital health systems, currently hosted on US-based infrastructure, moved to local servers. These platforms include Kenya Health Information System (KHIS2), Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMFL), Afya KE, KenyaEMR, Chanjo KE, Damu KE, and Kemsa I-LMIS, all developed and maintained with USAID support. They are central to how Kenya tracks diseases, manages patient treatment, produces vaccines, and keeps rural health clinics running.

Kenya’s primary healthcare system would struggle to function without these platforms. Years of underfunding and systemic corruption have left the country heavily reliant on donor support, particularly from USAID. Cuts to aid under President Trump have exposed millions of Kenyans to gaps in essential health services, from HIV treatment to routine vaccinations.

“The recent challenges have underscored the vulnerabilities in our health data infrastructure,” Duale said. “It’s imperative that we invest in secure, locally managed data systems to ensure continuity and resilience in our healthcare delivery.”

Since March, Kenya’s health officials have reported losing access to data following USAID funding cuts and a subsequent shutdown ordered by the Trump administration.

USAID had committed $2.5 billion to Kenya in its 2020–2025 strategic plan, averaging $471 million in funding each year. An estimated 80% of this budget was earmarked for healthcare initiatives, covering areas such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, and vaccination programs.

In May, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) also reported that Kenya could not access data from the Kenya Health Information System, a crucial tool for disease surveillance and health planning.

Kenyan health officials have also warned that USAID cuts have exposed gaps in maintenance and technology, raising concerns about the country’s capacity to monitor public health and respond to outbreaks effectively.

“With donor funds curtailed, these platforms now suffer from maintenance gaps and technology shortages, severely hindering Kenya’s ability to monitor public health trends and respond promptly to emerging crises,” the Ministry said in April.

With Kenya facing budget constraints, it remains unclear how quickly local systems will be rolled out to handle the transition. In February, the Ministry said USAID funding cuts would cause $ 403.8 million (KES 52 billion) in the country’s health budget.

Secretary-General António Guterres will award the honorary prizes, alongside the President of the seventy-ninth session of the General Assembly, Philemon Yang, as part of the annual commemoration marking Nelson Mandela International Day on 18 July under the theme of “It’s still in our hands to combat poverty and inequality”.

“As the United Nations celebrates 80 years, Nelson Mandela’s legacy of reconciliation and transformation continues to inspire and drive us,” Secretary-General António Guterres said. “This year’s Mandela prize winners embody the spirit of unity and possibility — reminding us how we all have the power to shape stronger communities and a better world.”

General Assembly President Philemon Yang, who chaired the 2025 Selection Committee, said: “The 2025 UN Nelson Mandela Prize not only honours the legacy of Madiba, but affirms that the spirit of multilateralism lives through the tireless efforts of its laureates — two individuals whose lives reflect the courage to lead, the humility to serve, and the vision to unite across borders.”

The winners were selected from 331 nominations received for candidates in 66 Member States.

Ms. Reynolds is a Status Treaty member of the Fishing Lake Saulteaux First Nation, in Saskatchewan, Canada. She is known for her development of the Indian Residential School Resolution Health Support programme under the Indian Residential Settlement Agreement and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

“I speak two languages, yet words fail to express my deep gratitude and surprise at receiving the UN Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize. I am truly humbled. Mandela, a figure I’ve long admired for his work in reconciliation and against apartheid, recognized the parallels between his homeland and the struggles of Indigenous peoples. I have always felt a deep kinship with him,” said Ms. Reynolds upon learning she was one of the two 2025 Laureates.

Mr. Odede is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at SHOFCO. He had been a street-child at the age of 10 and lived in the Kibera Slum for 23 years. Today, SHOFCO impacts more than 2.5 million people each year in Kenya by organizing and strengthening community groups across 68 sites and fostering partnerships to deliver essential services to support them. Kennedy/SHOFCO were also recognized with the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour award in 2021.

“I am so humbled. This award is not about me — it is about the power of communities, and the trust put in local leadership,” said Mr. Odede. “Nelson Mandela taught us that dignity and justice begin from the ground up. This recognition affirms what we believe at SHOFCO: the answers to poverty and inequality already exist within the people most affected.”

The winner’s bios are included in this press release.

At the July ceremony, the winners will receive a glass trophy engraved with a quote from Nelson Mandela: “What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others.”

Brenda Reynolds

Brenda Reynolds, a Status Treaty member of the Fishing Lake Saulteaux First Nation, Saskatchewan, brings a lifetime of lived experience, advocacy and professional leadership to the forefront of Indigenous health, mental wellness and reconciliation efforts in Canada and internationally. Her personal journey — from impacts of cultural genocide to a nationally recognized leader in trauma-informed care — has shaped her deep commitment to addressing the intergenerational impacts of the Indian Residential School system and government assimilation policies.

A social worker, Brenda has varied work experiences with First Nation community work, provincial and federal governments. She played a pivotal role in the largest to date court-ordered Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. Her leadership helped establish the Indian Residential School Resolution Health Support Program — a national, culturally grounded mental health initiative. The Resolution Health Support workers became the first trauma responders to the Indian residential school survivors, their families and Canadians. This programme is still funded and active today, noted for its contributions to healing and post-traumatic growth.

In 1988, Brenda worked and supported 17 teen girls who disclosed sexual abuse at Gordon’s Residential School by a staff member. This was the first court case of sexual abuse by an Indian residential school staff member in Saskatchewan. The final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission later stated that the Gordon’s Indian Residential School has become known as one of the “worst run schools in the entire residential school system”.

Brenda later worked as a special adviser to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where she coordinated survivor support at national events and advised Commissioners on trauma response. Her ability to mediate, de-escalate and lead with compassion earned the praise of law enforcement and event organizers alike.

Brenda’s expertise is sought globally. In 2023, she was invited by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the European Union to share her insights on trauma and cultural genocide. Her doctoral studies in clinical psychology focus on trauma interventions for cultural genocide, further contributing to global academic understanding.

Brenda continues to provide consultation and training across Canada and internationally, bringing clarity and compassion to complex conversations on trauma, reconciliation and healing. She currently resides in Alberta, Canada.

Kennedy Odede

Kennedy Odede is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at SHOFCO, Kenya’s largest grassroots movement, and one of Africa’s most esteemed social entrepreneurs and community organizers. He is best known for his award-winning work to transform the lives of slum residents and direct resources and decision-making power to local community organizations.

Kennedy became a street child at the age of 10 and lived in the Kibera Slum for 23 years. During this time, he experienced extreme poverty first-hand, but also witnessed the palpable hope that persists in slums and recognized that people sought something different for themselves, their families and their communities. Through earning $1 for 10 hours of work at a factory, Kennedy managed to save 20 cents to buy a soccer ball, which he used to bring community members together, and, with that, SHOFCO was born.

Today, SHOFCO impacts more than 2.4 million people each year in Kenya by organizing and strengthening community groups across 68 sites and fostering partnerships to deliver essential services to support them.

In 2024, Kennedy was named one of TIME’s 100 Most Influential People. In addition, he has been appointed by administrator Samantha Power to the USAID Advisory Committee and has served as a Fellow with Humanity in Action, Aspen Institute and Echoing Green. Kennedy is also a Young Global Leader at the World Economic Forum, an Obama Foundation Africa Leader and a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. Prior to this, he served on the United Nations International Commission for Financing of Global Education Opportunities, and on the Board of Directors of Wesleyan University.

Kennedy is the co-author of the New York Times Best Seller, Find Me Unafraid: Love, Loss and Hope in an African Slum, which he wrote with his wife, Jessica Posner Odede. His work has been featured by President Bill Clinton, and on multiple occasions by Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times.

However, little evidence exists on the status of FP integration within self-care-oriented DSDM (SC-DSDM). We explored the status of FP integration into SC-DSDM, stakeholders’ perspectives about and barriers to integrating FP into SC-DSDM and suggestions for improving FP integration into SC-DSDM. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in 18 purposely-selected health facilities in 17 districts across four high HIV-prevalence regions between September and October 2022. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with women living with HIV (i.e., clients), receiving ARV drug refills through SC-DSDM, and 47 key informant interviews with selected stakeholders including healthcare providers, district health managers, implementing partner representatives and policymakers. Data were collected on the different forms of FP integration into SC-DSDM; perspectives on integrating FP into SC-DSDM, and barriers to and suggestions for improving FP integration into SC-DSDM. Data were analyzed following a thematic framework approach. Results We found two forms of FP integration into SC-DSDM: a) one-stop center (in which ART and FP services were provided at the same service delivery point) and b) collaboration/referral to another service delivery point. Only four health facilities offered ART and FP services through the one-stop center; the rest of the health facilities referred clients to the maternal and child health/FP clinic or to other health facilities. All categories of stakeholders agreed that the one-stop center is more convenient and less time-consuming since referral to another service delivery point can increase patient waiting time or result in multiple clinic visits if ART and FP services are offered on separate days. Staff shortages, stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, shortage of adequate office space and lack of integrated registers continue to hamper effective integration of FP into SC-DSDM. Conclusion Despite the potential benefits of FP-HIV integration, FP and ART services continue to be offered as stand-alone programs with limited FP integration into SC-DSDM. These findings call for policy guidance from the Ministry of Health in integrating FP into SC-DSDM in Uganda.

Introduction Differentiated ART service delivery (DSD), previously referred to as ‘differentiated HIV care’, is a client-centered approach that simplifies and adapts HIV services in ways that not only meet the HIV clients’ needs but also reduce unnecessary burdens on the health care system [1]. Differentiated ART service delivery has been scaled up in many countries in recent years [2] with the goal of improving efficiencies in HIV care through reduced patients’ waiting time, reduced patients’ visits to the health facilities, and reduced health providers’ workload due to seeing patients less frequently through multi-month dispensing of ARV drugs [3]. As a result, most people living with HIV are now seen by clinicians or visit health facilities less frequently [4–6]. Concurrently, there is a renewed emphasis on ensuring that all women living with HIV (WLHIV) have access to other non-HIV services, including family planning (FP), as part of their HIV care and as an essential pillar in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [7–9]. This renewed emphasis on FP as an essential part of HIV care follows closely on recent calls for more inclusive and patient-centered care for people living with HIV [10,11]. However, WLHIV who visit health facilities to collect their ART do not fully benefit from patient-centered care if they have to return to the same health facility more frequently to receive other non-HIV services, including FP. Clients in DSD models should be supported to use contraceptive methods of their choice and, where ongoing commodities are required, be able to obtain these through their differentiated ART service delivery models (DSDM) [1]. One way in which WLHIV can be supported to access the contraceptive methods that they need when they come for their ARV drug refills is to streamline the schedules for contraception and ART resupplies in such a way that the client can be provided with FP supplies of the same duration as their ART refills [12]. Under an ideal integrated FP and HIV service delivery mechanism, FP and ART care should be provided at the same time, in the same place and, where possible, by the same provider [13]. This can be achieved through different approaches, including use of multi-skilled HIV and FP providers and a one-stop service center within the ART clinic site (or at the community drug distribution point) offering HIV and FP services under one roof [14]. In Tanzania, for example, women in DSDM have access to a full range of contraception options; ART and FP are both offered within the same care and treatment centers [15]. This alignment ensures uninterrupted supply of contraceptives and ART while minimizing visits to the health facility [1]. Similar arrangements can be made for community-based ART delivery approaches, including sending out multi-skilled HIV and FP providers to manage ART refills and FP supplies at the community outreach service delivery points [16]. Similarly, for community group models, provision of FP can be aligned with the scheduled FP refill of the group member who goes to the health facility (or community drug distribution point) to pick ART for the other members [1]. In 2016, Uganda made DSDM a priority in the national HIV prevention, care and treatment guidelines so that HIV service delivery could be more client-centered and scarce resources could be refocused to those most in need [17]. In 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health developed the national policy guidelines and service standards for sexual and reproductive health services and rights (SRHR) [18] that called for integrating STI/HIV and AIDS within SRHR services. However, these guidelines did not include details on how STI/HIV and AIDS integration into SRHR services would be implemented. In tandem with this observation, the Ministry of Health, in 2017, developed DSDM implementation guidelines that were more aligned to HIV service delivery [19]. These guidelines were expected to provide guidance on the integration of FP into the differentiated ART service delivery models. However, until this assessment, there was no formal evaluation to determine if FP integration was well streamlined within the DSDM guidelines, and if so, whether integration of FP into the DSDM was being implemented based on these guidelines. Differentiated ART service delivery is now the primary mode of providing ART refills to people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Uganda with the majority (65.6%) of the patients categorized as stable clients (or clients on less intensive models) while 34.4% are unstable patients/clients on more intensive models [20]. Stable patients are those with near-perfect ART adherence and who have achieved virological suppression while ‘unstable patients’ are those that still have ART adherence challenges and are still virally non-suppressed [19,20]. In Uganda, DSD models for stable patients include a) Fast-track drug refills (FTDR) in which HIV-positive stable patients in care for six or more months, who are TB-free, pick their drugs directly from the health facility’s dispensary or ART clinic once every three months; b) community drug distribution point (CDDP) in which healthcare providers provide ART services to stable patients in a given locality (e.g., at lower-level health centers, private pharmacy or other locations) in the community on a rotational basis, once every three months; and c) Community client-led ART delivery (CCLAD) in which stable patients (who have been on HIV treatment for six or more months) are arranged into groups of 3–6 patients, one of which goes to the facility of their ART registration to pick ARV drug refills on behalf of the other members on a rotational basis (once every three months). DSD models for unstable clients include: a) Facility-based individual management and b) Facility-based groups [19,20]. This paper focuses exclusively on DSD models for stable clients. Given that the Uganda Government has prioritized self-care as part of its strategy to reach universal health care coverage [21], this study focused on three differentiated ART service delivery models for stable patients (fast-track drug refill, community drug distribution point, and community client-led ART delivery), hereafter referred to as ‘self-care-oriented DSDM’ (SC-DSDM), due to their potential increased efficiency within the HIV care system while enabling clients to receive self-care-oriented FP services. We defined self-care-oriented FP services as FP services that WLHIV, enrolled in SC-DSDM, can access and use with minimal or no provider interaction, and for which they can receive FP supplies or services of the same duration, if needed, as their ART refills. However, while integrating FP into the DSDM in general and the three SC-DSD models in particular would improve access to FP services and methods and reduce the frequency of client visits to the health facility, by the time of this assessment, no formal evaluation had been conducted to document the status of FP integration into the self-care-oriented DSD models. This assessment aimed to explore: a) the status of FP integration into the three SC-DSDM, b) client, health provider, implementing partner and policymaker perspectives about and barriers to integrating FP integration into the SC-DSDM, c) whether or not FP-HIV integration was clearly defined (in terms of how it should be done, when, and by whom) within the existing DSDM guidelines, and d) suggestions on how to improve FP-HIV integration within the DSDM framework in Uganda.

Methods Study site This qualitative study was conducted in 17 districts in four purposely-selected geographical regions with the highest HIV prevalence in Uganda, based on the findings from the 2020–21 Uganda Population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey (hereafter referred to as ‘UPHIA 2020-21’) [22]. UPHIA 2020–21 was a nationwide survey conducted to provide estimates of HIV prevalence, viral load suppression, and other important HIV/AIDS program indicators [22]. The selected regions included: 1) Central-1 (HIV prevalence – 8.1%); 2) Mid-North (HIV prevalence – 7.6%); 3) South-western (HIV prevalence – 6.3%) and 4) Central-2 (HIV prevalence – 6.2%). Study design and population This was a qualitative study conducted among WLHIV who had ever used a FP method since joining a self-care-oriented DSDM; SC-DSDM implementers at health facility level (ART clinic in-charge, Facility In-charge, and Maternal and Child Health [MCH]/FP clinic in-charge); district health officials (District Health Officers [DHO], Assistant DHO in-charge of MCH, and/or district FP focal person); staff from implementing partner (IP) organizations that support health services in each region, and policymakers. Policymakers included national-level staffs who were involved in the design and rollout of the DSDM guidelines countrywide. Selection of health facilities and participants Selection of health facilities. In Uganda, government-owned/public health facilities are categorized as health center level-II (HC-II) which serves an estimated population of 5,000 people; health center level-III (HC-III) which serves an estimated population of 20,000 people; health center level-IV (HC-IV) which serves an estimated population of 100,000 people; district/general hospital which serves an estimated population of 500,000 people; regional hospital which serves an estimated population of 1,000,000 people; regional referral hospital which serves an estimated population of 2,000,000 people, and national referral hospital which serves an estimated population of 10,000,000 people [23]. Only health facilities at the level of HC-III or higher (or as otherwise classified by the Ministry of Health, if they are private health facilities) are accredited to offer ART in Uganda. Using data from the Ministry of Health’s District Health Information System Software-version 2 (DHIS-2), we documented the names of all the ART-accredited health facilities in each region and categorized them into high- and low-volume health facilities based on the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled in HIV care as of June 2022. Health facilities with less than 500 PLHIV in care at the time were categorized as low-volume health facilities while those with 500 PLHIV or more in care were considered to be high-volume facilities. The cut-off (i.e., 500 PLHIV) for categorizing a health facility as ‘low-’ or ‘high-volume’ was determined arbitrarily, assuming that health facilities with 500 PLHIV or higher were more likely to have patients registered in the different self-care-oriented DSD models of interest. We purposively selected 18 health facilities across the four regions, including 14 government-owned/public health facilities and four private not-for-profit health facilities. Initially, all the six regional referral hospitals that exist within the four regions were selected (i.e., Mbarara and Kabale Regional Referral Hospitals in the Southwestern region; Masaka Regional Referral Hospital in Central-1 region; Mubende Regional Referral Hospital in Central-2 region, and Lira and Gulu Regional Referral Hospitals in the Mid-Northern region). These hospitals were included because they have a high patient load and were, therefore, presumed to implement several DSDM, including the self-care-oriented models for stable clients (i.e., facility- and community-based models). After selecting the regional referral hospitals, we purposely selected three lower-level health facilities within each region for a total of 12 health facilities. The 12 health facilities included three hospitals (two district/general hospitals and one private hospital), four government-owned/public HC-IVs, three HC-IIIs (two government-owned/public and one private health facility), and two special HIV clinics run by a national-level non-government organization. We included the two special HIV clinics because the organization that runs them has a long-standing experience in the implementation of community DSD models. Of the 18 health facilities, five were selected from the Mid-Northern region; five from the South-Western region, four from Central-1 region and four from the Central-2 region. Selection of participants. Eighty-three participants were interviewed for this study, including 36 WLHIV receiving HIV care who were receiving their ARV drug refills through the three SC-DSDM (also referred to as ‘clients’ elsewhere in this paper); 35 healthcare providers working at the selected 18 health facilities; four (4) district health officials; five (5) IP staff representatives, and three (3) policymakers. To participate in the study, clients had to be stable patients, enrolled into one of the three (3) self-care-oriented DSDM, and have used a FP method since joining DSDM. At each health facility, we worked with the in-charge of the ART clinic to identify eligible WLHIV, stratified by the type of SC-DSDM they were enrolled in. The identified clients were recorded on a pre-printed participant log. The ART in-charges made initial contact with the clients (via phone contact or through a provider or linkage facilitator, as appropriate) to inform them about the study and inquire about their interest in participating in the study. While the use of the ART clinic in-charges to contact WLHIV might have influenced their participation in the study in some way, women had the right to decline participation without this (i.e., declining to participate in the study) affecting their access to routine HIV care at the same health facility. Interested WLHIV were connected to the data collector via phone (or through a provider or linkage facilitator, as appropriate) to provide them with more information about the study and conduct initial screening on the phone to confirm compliance with the study eligibility criteria. To confirm eligibility, stable clients (as designated by the ART clinic) were asked about their DSD model of enrolment and if they had ever used a FP method since they joined the DSDM. Stable clients, enrolled in any of the three SC-DSDMs and who had used a FP method since they joined the DSDM, were eligible for this study. Clients who were confirmed to be eligible were invited for an interview at the health facility. We sought informed consent from all the clients prior to their participation in the study. Regarding healthcare providers, we selected either the health facility in-charge, ART in-charge, or the MCH in-charge/FP focal person. The study team contacted the participants by phone or in person at the health facility to inform them about the study and confirm their availability. For district health staff, we obtained the names and telephone contacts of the DHOs (who are the substantive heads of health programs in their districts) from the Ministry of Health and contacted them initially via the phone. If they were willing to be interviewed, we set an appointment with them either at the district headquarters or at any other venue that they considered appropriate. Through the DHOs, we obtained the names and telephone contacts of the other district health staffs (Assistant DHO in charge of MCH or District FP Focal Person) who were also contacted and an appointment was set with them if they were willing to be interviewed. We used the same strategy while approaching the implementing partner organizations in each region. Implementing partner organizations were asked to recommend staffs who were invited for interview at an appropriate time and venue. For policymakers, we set appointments for physical interviews through telephone calls to the respective policymakers. Data collection procedures and methods Data were collected during the months of September and October 2022 by a team of thirteen trained data collectors. In-depth interviews were conducted with WLHIV while key informant interviews were conducted with health facility staff, staff representatives from IP organizations, district health officials and policymakers using unstructured interview guides. Clients were asked questions such as: “Have you used family planning in the past?”, “What places have you gotten [FP] methods from in the past?”, and “Please think back to the past year, have you gotten your [FP] method at the same time that you got your ARV?” (See Supplementary File 1 in S1 File for details). On the other hand, key informant interviews were asked questions like: “Could you please describe how integration of FP into DSDM is meant to take place in the health facilities?”, and “What guidelines were followed during the process of integrating FP into DSDM?” (See Supplementary Files 2–4 in S1 File for details). The interviews with clients were conducted in the local language that they were comfortable with while key informant interviews were conducted in English. All the interviews were audio-recorded with permission from the participants. Interviews lasted between 45–90 minutes. Prior to data collection, the data collection team underwent fieldwork preparation training for three days. As part of the training, the data collection team pre-tested the data collection tools in a health facility in a non-study district to test data collection procedures, ensure clear wording of the data collection tools, and evaluate the readiness of the data collection team. Areas of weakness, identified during the pre-testing exercise, were corrected prior to fieldwork. Data analysis The audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim (in the same way they were conducted in the local language) and later translated into English for data analysis. An independent researcher, conversant with the local language as well as the English language, reviewed the transcripts along with the recordings for quality assurance. The transcripts were then used to conduct a Microsoft Excel-based, thematic matrix analysis. Data analysis followed the steps of the thematic framework approach, as suggested by Braun and Clarke [24]. Initially, AM read through twenty transcripts to get familiar with the data and generated a tentative list of initial codes. Using the tentative list of codes, AM searched for deductive themes of inquiry including forms of FP integration into the SC-DSDM, FP-HIV integration into the community-based DSD models, alignment of FP-HIV integration to the DSDM guidelines, perceptions about integrating FP into the SC-DSDM, barriers/challenges to FP-HIV integration in the SC-DSDM and suggestions for improving the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM. AM and JKBM reviewed the codes for each theme to check for “referential adequacy” by comparing the codes with the raw data to ensure that they accurately reflected the meanings intended by the participants [25]. Inadequacies in the codes were rectified through discarding those that were inconsistent with the themes or through adding new ones. AM and JKBM met to review and generate the final list of codes. Using the final list of codes, AM used Atlas.ti qualitative data analysis software (version 9.0) to check the remaining transcripts for relevant quotations that pertained to each a priori theme and copied and pasted them into the Excel matrix. JKBM, AM and RKW reviewed the matrix to identify rich “textual” quotations that were used in supporting the key findings presented in this paper. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) in reporting the findings [26]. Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Makerere University School of Public Research and Ethics Committee (protocol number SPH-2021–185) and registered by the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (HS2026ES). Permission was also sought from the relevant district officials and health facility in charges. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation and consent to an audio-recorded interview.

Results Characteristics of the study participants Table 1 shows the number and categories of participants included in this study. The distribution of WLHIV mimics the general distribution of the patients across the different DSDM, with the highest number of participants drawn from FTDR and the lowest number from CCLAD. Generally, there were few or no WLHIV enrolled in the CCLAD model across facilities. PPT PowerPoint slide

Number and category of participants included in the study. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0324616.t001 Forms of FP integration into the SC-DSDM At the time we conducted the study, FP-HIV integration in general was already taking place. However, we did not know if and how FP integration into the DSDM was taking place. To understand if and how FP integration into the DSDM was taking place, we asked women to tell us about where they access their FP services and methods when they come for their ART refills. In response, a few of the women indicated that they received their FP methods from the same service delivery point where they obtain their ART refills while the majority indicated that they are referred to the maternal and child health [MCH] clinic/FP clinic. Thus, FP integration was deemed to take two different forms: a) integration through the one-stop center and b) integration through referral to another service delivery point. The two forms of FP-HIV integration are summarized below. a) FP-HIV integration through the one-stop center (i.e., combined service provision). All the 18 health facilities offered FP information and counselling to WLHIV in care through the three self-care-oriented DSD models (i.e., FTDR, CDDP, and CCLAD). However, only four health facilities offered FP services (including FP methods) and ART refills to WLHIV through the one-stop center. The four health facilities included one (1) government-owned/public Regional Referral Hospital, one (1) private-for-profit hospital, and two (2) non-governmental organization (NGO) special HIV clinics. At these health facilities, clients received both ART and FP services at the same place due to the presence of space to offer both services and a team of “knowledgeable” (multi-trained FP-HIV) health workers, as the following quotations illustrate: When I come here [at the CDDP] to get my ARVs, there is … a place where we get our ARVs from; that is where we go… After giving you your ARVs, then they give you the injection … at the same point because we have a room… in that very room, I leave with my packed ARVs; they have [also] given me my FP injection (CDDP client, Central-2 Region) “Being a regional referral hospital, we have most of the FP equipment … family planning methods, the knowledgeable health workers … stationed in the ART clinic to provide the family planning services to those patients” (Healthcare provider, South-Western Region) Although some health provider in-charges indicated that FP had been integrated into the SC-DSDM, there were cases where client interviews reviewed opposite information, with some clients reporting that they were instead referred to the MCH/FP clinic for FP services. However, some health provider in-charges acknowledged that they had tried to integrate FP services into the SC-DSDM but faced challenges in maintaining regular stocks of FP supplies. In such facilities, the offer of FP through the SC-DSDM had ceased to be provided. “We used to go with FP supplies (condoms, injectables and pills) to community outreaches but this stopped last year due to la6ck of supplies (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) b) FP-HIV integration through referral (intra- or inter-facility referral). Of the 18 surveyed health facilities, 13 offered FP services (including methods) through referral to the MCH/FP clinic on the same compound as the ART clinic while one (1) health facility (a faith-based health facility) referred clients interested in receiving FP methods to other health facilities. In health facilities that refer to the MCH/FP clinic, some healthcare staff reported that WLHIV are escorted to the MCH/FP clinic as part of the referral process, as illustrated below. “.... what we do, we health educate and select those who are willing to get FP services every day, for those who are willing, we get somebody to escort them to MCH, we make sure they are worked on very fast so that [they] can go back to the clinic to get their drugs.” (ART provider in-charge, Southwestern Region) However, in general, most WLHIV noted that when they were referred from the ART service delivery point to the MCH/FP clinic, they were not escorted to the MCH/FP clinic and had to join the queue with the other patients who were waiting to be served at that point. This form of non-coordinated, intra-facility referral increased the time that WLHIV who had come to pick their ARV refills but were also interested in getting FP methods spent in the health facility. FP integration into the community-based DSD models Integrating FP services into the community-based DSD models can provide a useful opportunity for leveraging the ART platform to offer FP services to WLHIV at the community level. This can help to reduce the need for WLHIV to come to the health facilities for FP services when they can receive them as part of community-based DSD models. In response to the question as to whether WLHIV, who receive their ARV drug refills through CDDP or CCLAD, receive FP services at the same time as their ARV drugs, most women indicated that they have to make a separate visit to the health facility for FP services. This finding was corroborated by some of the healthcare providers who confirmed that health outreach teams (which deliver ARV drugs to the community distribution points) usually do not carry FP methods along with the ARVs, with the exception of condoms. “Clients do not get FP supplies at the CDDP – these points act only as ART pick-up points. No FP services are provided there” (ART provider in-charge, Central-1 Region) During interviews with the healthcare providers, we found that there was very limited integration of FP into the community DSD models largely because the ART team prioritized ART to FP provision at the community outreach sites, and usually did not carry a mix of short-term FP supplies with them to those sites, except condoms. The only exception was the two NGO special clinics, which provided some FP methods through the CCLAD model. However, even then, our team was not able to document how FP services are provided to clients in the CCLAD model given that this model is organized to have only one person come for ART refills for the other members, usually once every three months. Otherwise, in the rest of the health facilities, integration of FP into the CCLAD model seemed not to be taking place: “… but in that [CCLAD] group, in case there is a client who is on injectable, we are not able to dispense to the [CCLAD] leader. We shall link that client to the nearby health facility to receive the method. But if the client in that group is able to come to the facility, then we shall be able to provide the family planning method she wants” (Health care provider, South-Western Region) Besides the limited FP integration into the community DSD models, we found that the implementation of the community DSD models had stalled in some geographical regions due to limited facilitation for community outreach activities. For instance, in the Central-2 region, only two of the four health facilities surveyed had active patients in the CCLAD model. Likewise, in the South-West region, only three of the five health facilities surveyed had active clients in the CDDP or CCLAD model. Alignment of FP integration with the DSDM Guidelines As noted earlier, one of the study objectives was to explore whether FP integration into the DSDM was well streamlined into the DSDM guidelines, and if so, whether integration of FP into the SC-DSDM was being implemented based on the DSDM guidelines. Our findings show that FP integration into the DSDM was not comprehensively discussed during the design of the guidelines or considered during the training of health providers prior to the roll-out of the DSDM guidelines. Specifically, the training of health providers on the implementation of the DSDM guidelines focused exclusively on improving efficiency in ART provision with no specific reference to FP integration: “I can ably say that in my own assessment... FP was not given that due attention [during the training]. We were focusing on the general principles of DSDM so when we reached on what services we were supposed to offer [under DSDM], I think our focus was mainly on ARVs, isoniazid prophylaxis, anti-TBs” (Implementing partner, South-Western Region) “I participated in rolling out the [DSDM], and training of health workers on the different models but am not aware there was a specific training on FP so it might not have been emphasized” (District Health Official, South-Western Region) In interviews with the policymakers who were involved in the design and rollout of the DSDM guidelines at national level, we were informed that since there were already FP services within the health facilities (either through the MCH or FP clinics); it was presumed that a different FP service delivery point at the ART clinic was not necessary. Instead, the policy-makers presumed that clients would access FP services through intra-facility referrals to the MCH/FP clinic. “I think we did not think so much about family planning at that time [of developing the guidelines]. We concentrated more on HIV, access to HIV services. We had not concentrated on integration [of family planning], the only thing we integrated early were those things which are closely related to HIV like TB” (Policymaker, National level) Perceptions about FP integration into the DSDM When we interviewed clients regarding their perspectives on integrating FP into the DSDM, all of them agreed that integrating FP into the DSDM as part of the HIV care clinic is convenient and less time-consuming, when compared to being referred to the MCH clinic. A client from a facility where integration is taking place noted: “… when you reach there at the facility, you can easily get all these [ART and FP] services at once from the same place, you receive the ARVs and […] the family planning injection [at the same time]” (FTDR client, South-Western Region) SC-DSDM clients reported that it is inconveniencing to receive FP services from the MCH clinic because they have to line-up again (and join long lines before being served) and that, at times, FP and ART services run on different days, meaning that when they get one service (e.g., ART refills) on any typical day, they would have to come back to the facility on another day to receive another service (e.g., FP). “… sometimes there are many people at family planning [unit] so I come early and I end up leaving late. I would wish that [the services were on] the same day. That’s the only challenge I have found, time. Because I come around 9am and leave around 2pm” (FTDR client, South-Western Region) Providers and implementing partners thought that FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM would reduce waiting time at the health facility and reduce unmet need among HIV clients. “For me I say [FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM] is very good. Because it reduces the time clients take within the hospital. The client will come, get all the services in one place and go, instead of referring her to the MCH, where she finds the line is too long, and she waits for 4-5 hours yet she stays far” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) Barriers/challenges to FP integration into the DSDM Barriers/challenges to FP integration into the DSDM were explored from the providers’ and implementing partners’ point of view. The most common barriers, cited by both providers and implementers, were: staff shortages, stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, shortage of office space, difficulty synchronizing FP and HIV service return-time, increased workload, and lack of integrated registers, as indicated in the following sub-sections. a) Staff shortages. Across health facilities, health provider in-charges reported that they had few health providers allocated to the HIV clinic and that given the heavy client load in the HIV clinic, most health providers focus on ART service provision at the expense of FP services. In one health facility which had a designated health worker to serve WLHIV interested in FP services when they come to the ART clinic, we were informed that the said health worker had been transferred to another health facility without any replacement plans in place. There used to be a trained midwife who offered FP in the ART clinic. However, she is on maternity leave and on transfer to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital. There is no plan for a replacement (ART health provider in-charge, Mid-Northern Region) b) Stock-outs of short-term FP commodities. Persistent stock-outs of FP supplies were reported across all health facilities to the extent that in at least one health facility, providers had resorted to encouraging clients to use long-term reversible methods that were more commonly available than short-term FP methods that were always out of stock. This has implications for the available FP methods-mix that WLHIV can choose from, depending on their preferences. At another health facility, health providers reported that short-term FP supplies run out so fast yet there is no replenishment plan in place. [We used to have] someone who would offer Sayana press to [WLHIV] in the HIV clinic but supplies ran out in only two months and there has not been any replenishment (ART health provider in-charge, Central-1 Region) “Another challenge [to integration] is that FP commodities are not there. If they would be providing us with a constant [supply of] these short-term commodities and there are no stock-outs, then our service delivery will be perfect.” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) c) Shortage of adequate office space. Health providers reported that one of the challenges they have faced regarding integrating FP into the SC-DSDM is the issue of space. Health providers reported that the limited HIV clinic space was not sufficient to enable them to provide some FP methods, especially those that would require client privacy. “FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM is okay but the challenge we have now is space, because initiating any mother or any client on family planning, we first need to examine and now at the ART clinic, space for examination of mothers it is not there” (Healthcare provider, South-western Region) “… I would say our space [is a challenge]. By the time we made that construction in ART clinic, family planning program was not there but now we have to squeeze in the limited space we are having, it is where we do the screening for cervical cancer, then again it is where we have FP, it is the same place” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) d) Difficulty in synchronizing FP and HIV return-time and duration of supplies. Another important challenge was that FP and ART do not have synchronized schedules. For this reason, while a woman may come for their ART drug refill on a particular day, it was likely that FP services were provided on another clinic day which required them to come back at another time. This lack of synchronization of FP and ART schedules made women to resort to obtaining their FP supplies elsewhere rather than return to the same health facility on another day to receive their FP supplies. In addition, while women would be given ART drug refills for six months, there was no indication that women who used contraceptive pills, for instance, were given supplies to last them until their next ART refill visit date. “… [FP-HIV integration into SC-DSDM] is a good thing but the implementation is not as smooth … I just want to give an example of someone in [in the] fast-track model; right. This mother is going to…. take ARVs for six months and maybe on that day she gets her family planning shot, in those six months she will be expected to have gotten another family planning shot” (Implementing partner, Mid-Northern Region) e) Use of different registers for FP and HIV data capture. At health facility, FP and HIV services are captured in different registers. Since the FP register is usually located at the MCH/FP side of the health facility, providing FP services to women receiving their drug refills through the SC-DSDM would require that the ART provider go to the MCH/FP clinic to complete the FP register; something that most providers find burdensome and time consuming. For instance, in the health facilities where FP services were provided at the same time as the ART drug refills, some ART providers use a paper-log to capture the details about their ART client who had received FP services, and then use the paper-log to complete the FP register at another time. Given the staff shortages in the ART clinics and the burden that would come with providing FP services through the SC-DSDM, most of the health workers preferred to refer the women to the MCH/FP clinic rather than offer FP services at the same ART service delivery point. “The issue is about the documentation and even the accountability of the commodities. We are not supposed to be having 2 data tools [registers] within the facility, it is supposed to be one. So, it is better to offer it [FP] through MCH” (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) What this healthcare provider was trying to emphasize was the fact that health facilities are not expected to maintain two registers for the same service (e.g., have a FP register at the ART clinic and a different copy at the MCH/FP clinic), it is better to have the FP register at the MCH/FP clinic which traditionally provides FP and other maternal-related services in health facility settings. f) Inadequate facilitation for outreach activities. Inadequate financial facilitation and/or lack of transport to go for community outreaches were cited as one of the main challenges faced by health workers as they integrated FP into community-based DSDM. Some health providers reported that while they had started to operate the community-based models, they had to close them due to lack of funding or client instability. “Those ones [the CCLAD] we tried at the beginning when we were starting the community delivery model but it didn’t pick up … They [clients] were shifting from [one] place to the other, others went to school” (Healthcare provider, South-Western Region) “It [the CDDP arrangement] didn’t go on because of facilitation. There’s a challenge of transport. Even when these health workers go to the field, at least they need like a bottle of water, but now the finances are limited. So, it couldn’t go on” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) Suggestions on how to improve FP integration into the SC-DSDM To address the above-mentioned barriers/challenges to FP integration into the SC-DSDM, implementing partners, healthcare providers and district health managers suggested a need to: a) build the capacity of existing HIV staff in the provision of FP services; b) recruit additional health workers to deal with the persistent staff shortages; c) provide integration guidelines to the health facilities; and d) merge reporting tools. These points are elaborated below. a) Build the capacity of existing ART staff to offer FP services. To improve the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM, most health care providers suggested that HIV providers should be continuously trained in the provision of FP services. For the CCLAD model, the health providers recommended that expert clients should be trained to provide FP services to fellow clients in the community. “Mainly it could be better if all the people that are attached to the ART clinic are trained to offer all the family planning services offered to the clients. If that is done, it means that these clients will be receiving services from one point other than being referred to the MCH clinic” (Healthcare provider, Central-1 Region) “The other thing I have seen is that for the CCLAD their expert client requires training like what we did for the Village Health Teams (VHT) so that when he takes for them family planning methods and (he/she) is asked questions and he/she can answer. The VHT members were trained and showed how to inject for family planning therefore the expert client needs to be trained especially on how to inject for family planning because an injection must not just be given by one who is not trained” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region) b) Recruit additional health workers to minimize staff shortages. In addition to building the capacity of available staff through training, some of the health care provider in-charges recommended the need to recruit more health workers to address staff shortages and reduce the workload created by the need to provide FP at the same service delivery point on top of HIV services. “Maybe they [the Ministry of Health] should […] recruit more health workers to deal with the large clientele. I know because the line is long in the [HIV] clinic because of the number of clients they receive and now the integration, so they have to make sure that they bring more health workers to give the service [integrated services]. That is what I think, because there are delays to the clients as they must wait for the available health workers to offer the different integrated services to them” (Healthcare provider, South-western Region) c) Provide clear guidelines on FP integration into the SC-DSDM to health providers. A few health workers acknowledged that there were no clear guidelines on how they should integrate FP into the SC-DSDM at the health facilities. They therefore recommended the need to provide clear guidelines to guide health workers in the provision of FP services integrated into the SC-DSDM. The availability of these guidelines should help to address some of the challenges already mentioned in this paper, including the need for synchronized FP/HIV return times and duration of FP supplies; how WLHIV receiving FP services at a different service delivery point (other than the HIV clinic or CDDP) should be handled when they come for FP services; and what data should be collected, when, and using what data capture tools when WLHIV under the SC-DSDM receive FP services: “We don’t have a clear guideline of the integration. There is no document you can look at to know how we integrate this; there is no such document, there are no standard operating procedures to refer to. We need supporting guidelines to help the health worker to routinely refer to, to make the integration better” (Healthcare provider, Mid-Northern Region) d) Merge FP and HIV reporting tools. Some participants recommended the need to merge the reporting tools to reduce the burden of having to fill in two different (FP and HIV) registers where a person received FP and HIV services. “… We have an independent register for family planning; can we have the same dispensing log to capture ART commodities and family planning commodities? Because you find a health worker after writing a huge book for ART, you close the chapter; open another huge book for family planning. Let them have one register for that! Yeah. That should be changed completely because most problems are in the work you have to do when the patient has left. You find people struggling with books. So, they should look into that” (Healthcare provider, Central-2 Region)

Discussion This study found that all the 18 facilities sampled offered FP information/ counseling through the three self-care-oriented DSDM but only four facilities provided FP methods in the same ART clinic or in the same community outreach visit. In general, we found that: a) most of the clients receiving their ARV drug refills through the facility-based DSD models have to access FP methods through referral to the MCH/FP clinic, located outside the ART service delivery point while b) most of the clients receiving their RV drug refills through the community-based DSD models have to make a separate physical visit to the MCH/FP clinic, usually on another day, to obtain their FP supplies. The finding that only four out 18 health facilities had FP integrated into the SC-DSDM is frustrating given current efforts to support the integration of FP into non-HIV services in Uganda [27]. However, these findings are not unusual [28–30]. In an evaluation of FP integration into the DSDM in Kenya in 2020, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Foundation found that FP services were not integrated into the comprehensive HIV care clinics in Kenya but required referral to the MCH unit. No FP services were integrated into ART refill visits, either in facility or community settings; as a result, all pre-packed ARVs for distribution in facility or community models did not include contraceptive commodities. Besides, ART and FP refills and visits were not formally aligned [30]. However, the successful integration of FP into services offered at HIV care clinics in other African settings has also been documented. In Tanzania, for example, contraceptive care was provided at the HIV care and treatment clinic, but in a different room and by a different healthcare provider as for ART refills. Contraceptive refills were aligned with ART refills (i.e., 3 months oral pills for those who receive 3-month ART refills) and could be collected along with ART (although women could queue for certain methods). Two lower-level sites offered a one-stop shop approach, while in higher level hospitals, FP services were offered by a different provider in a different room than ART [30]. The Tanzania example lends credence to the fact that integrating FP into the SC-DSDM is possible (only that it is not happening as expected) and that WLHIV can ably access FP services through these models. However, what is less documented is how the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM affects FP service uptake, including whether or not FP and ART supplies have been synchronized. Future research is needed to assess the dynamics of FP uptake in a FP-HIV integrated framework to inform the scale-up of FP-HIV integration across programs and countries. Our finding that FP information and counseling were provided to all clients at the surveyed health facilities demonstrates a very important step to ensure WLHIV have the information needed to reach their reproductive goals. Previous research shows that WLHIV who receive any FP counseling are significantly more likely to report current use of modern contraception than those who do not [31,32]. These findings support the need to ensure that FP counseling provided to WLHIV is of good quality and to enhance FP counseling when quality standards are not met. We, however, did not assess the quality of the FP information and counseling provided. Future research should focus on assessing quality and new tools to facilitate efficient provision of information and counseling in the context of staff shortages and numerous clients. We found that most WLHIV accessed FP services through non-coordinated intra-facility referral to the MCH/FP clinic. This means that when WLHIV are referred from the ART clinic to the MCH/FP clinic, they have to line up afresh for FP services since there is no prior arrangement (coordination) between the two clinics to offer timely FP services to the women referred from the ART clinic. The absence of FP supplies at the ART clinic is a historical challenge that emanates from the fact that, traditionally, FP services at health facility level are provided through the MCH/FP clinic. We think that the traditional alignment of FP with MCH services makes HIV providers to feel less compelled to stock FP services as part of HIV care. While this may be speculative (since we did not specifically collect data on HIV service providers’ attitudes towards providing FP services within the ART clinic), we believe that the long-standing availability of FP services at the MCH/FP clinic may call for a need to strengthen FP-HIV integration through coordinated intra-facility referral as an alternative model of integration, especially in situations where integration through the one-stop center may not be practically possible or achievable. Our findings already point to the fact that, in practice, there is more integration going on through collaboration than the one-stop center; thus, it may be helpful for the Ministry of Health and the donor community to explore the potential benefits of strengthening FP-HIV integration through referral to the MCH/FP clinic vis-à-vis promoting integration through the one-stop center that may be less feasible in some situations. However, it is important to note that the women interviewed for this study indicated a preference for the one-stop center model of FP integration into the SC-DSDM. The acceptability of integration as one of the approaches necessary to improve health service delivery has been documented in other studies [33,34]. For instance, in a study conducted in Mayuge, Uganda, Mezei et al. [33] found that 99% of women and 100% of the surveyed community health workers felt that integrating community-based HIV testing with cervical cancer screening was acceptable. In this same study, women noted a preference for a combined service delivery model as it can save them time and eliminate additional trips to the health center, which have resource implications, in cases when services are not available on the same day. Women living with HIV face heightened vulnerability compared to their counterparts who do not live with HIV given that they have to manage a chronic condition for life. The importance of facilitating access to holistic health care that addresses their full needs has been highlighted as the HIV community moves towards more holistic care [35] and lends credence to the fact that offering FP methods and ART refills in the same place, at the same time, by the same or a different provider is not only acceptable but also possible. However, the one-stop shop model, usually dubbed as “combined service provision” in the case of integrating FP into immunization services [36], is likely harder to achieve than models that offer information/counseling plus referral given that it requires staff training and coordination such as the need to synchronize or integrate family planning and HIV commodity supply chains [37]. Studies also show that the implementation of the one-stop shop model can be hampered by patients’ fear of stigma and discrimination (especially in community-based ART models), patients’ and providers’ low literacy levels on the DSD model and supply chain inconsistencies [29,38]. Thus, efforts geared at strengthening the provision of FP services through coordinated intra-facility referral may be the game-changer needed to improve access to FP services in most resource-constrained settings including Uganda. While the Ministry of Health has already developed a National Strategy for Integration of Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH), HIV/AIDS, TB, Nutrition and Gender Based Violence (GBV) [39], we believe that the need for the development of implementation guidelines to support the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM remains essential. It is important to note that the above-mentioned SRH-HIV-GBV strategy examines the aspect of integration from the point of view of sexual and reproductive health rather than from the HIV care point of view, offering limited guidance on how and when to integrate FP into the SC-DSDM. To support the integration of FP into the DSDM in general and SC-DSDM in particular, it will be essential that the Ministry of Health develops specific DSDM-focused, FP-HIV integration implementation guidelines that define how, when and for whom the integration should happen in each health facility. The Ministry of Health should put in place mechanisms to ensure a constant supply of contraceptive supplies as well as provide for adequate office space to improve space available for the implementation of the one-stop center integration approach. Combined reporting tools that capture data on the use of both FP and ARV drug refills may need to be developed to avoid the need for completing two different registers; one for the HIV care and the other for the FP supplies received. Finally, since we did not assess contraceptive uptake among WLHIV enrolled in the different SC-DSDM, we recommend further studies to assess differentials in FP uptake across the different SC-DSDM and document barriers/challenges and facilitators of contraceptive uptake under each DSD model within the FP-SC-DSDM integrated framework.

Study limitations and strengths This study was limited by the purposive sampling approach. Strictly interpreted, the results are only applicable to WLHIV who were interviewed for this study and not to the general population of WLHIV in the study regions in particular or Uganda in general. Nonetheless, the four study regions were chosen to represent a variety of local characteristics and we feel that the results will be useful to policymakers in designing guidelines for integrating FP into the SC-DSDM in other similar contexts. The other limitation is that this study relied on the self-reports of the clients and health providers regarding FP-HIV integration and the health facilities were categorized as integrating or not integrating based on this information. Because most WLHIV indicated that they obtained their FP services from the MCH/FP clinic, we categorized most health facilities as not integrating FP into the SC-DSDM without verifying that they actually obtained their FP methods from the MCH/FP clinics. If we did, this should have helped to inform our decision regarding whether or not the health facilities were actually integrating or not integrating FP into the SC-DSDM. However, we believe that this is a minor limitation. Given that we triangulated data collection methods and data sources (i.e., data were collected using in-depth interviews and key informant interviews with a diversity of participants including WLHIV, program implementers, district health managers, and policymakers), we believe that we made an accurate estimate of the FP-HIV integration status at the health facilities that we visited. Lastly, while we documented challenges/barriers inherent in implementing FP integration in the SC-DSDM, we relied on self-reports but did not try to quantify the magnitude of each barrier/challenge. For instance, we did not collect data on stock-outs of FP supplies but relied on self-reports during the provider interviews. This was because this study was conducted as a landscaping, qualitative study to inform future FP integration into the SC-DSDM rather than as a survey to obtain quantitative measures of each of the challenges/barriers noted. These limitations notwithstanding, our study had a number of strengths. First and foremost, this study is one among the few studies that have assessed FP-HIV integration from the perspective of SC-DSDM. Thus, while studies on integration of HIV with other services, including family planning, have been previously conducted, these studies did not assess FP integration from the perspective of SC-DSDM. We, therefore, believe that the study findings can help to inform the design of FP-HIV integration interventions in the context of SC-DSDM, including facility and community-based models. Secondly, our study involved a total of 83 qualitative interviews (including in-depth interviews and key informant interviews) with different categories of participants, including clients, healthcare providers, district health managers, implementing partner representatives, and policy-makers, thereby improving the credibility of the findings through triangulation by data source and data collection methods.

Conclusion Our findings show that despite the potential benefits of integrating FP into the SC-DSDM, only four out of 18 health facilities offered FP services integrated into the SC-DSDM. Even in the few facilities that integrated FP into SC-DSDM, several challenges/barriers, including frequent stock-outs of short-term FP supplies, staff shortages, and lack of adequate office space continued to hamper effective integration. Unfortunately, while the integration of FP into the SC-DSDM is being spear-headed by the donor community, at the moment, there are no guidelines to inform the effective integration of FP into the SC-DSDM. These findings call for policy guidance from the Ministry of Health in integrating FP into the SC-DSDM in Uganda. This will not only help in ensuring that there is uniform implementation of FP integration into the SC-DSDM but also provide guidance on how to address the barriers that currently inhibit the effective integration of FP into SC-DSDM in Uganda.

NbS for addressing water security challenges in cities are widely recognized for accelerating sustainability and delivering multiple co-benefits. However, peer-reviewed studies and implementation guidance have primarily focused on the Global North, necessitating adaptation for the Global South. While NbS could provide environmental and socio-economic benefits, the specific adaptations required for planning, designing, and implementing in the context of the Global South remain unclear. During the 6th Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE 6) held in Brisbane, Australia, in May 2023, a group of interdisciplinary experts discussed these challenges. This was followed by in-depth discussions with additional experts spanning various sectors across the Global South and a comprehensive literature review. This paper presents the outcomes of these efforts specifically focused on three objectives: understanding the NbS planning context in the Global South, identifying unique challenges for implementing NbS in these regions, and identifying “bright spots” as learning opportunities for implementation. We outline the contextual differences between the Global North and Global South in the context of water security and NbS, and then the challenges and opportunities to mainstream urban water NbS in the Global South are discussed across four thematic categories: environmental; socio-economic and perceptional; capacity, knowledge and expertise; and management and governance. We highlight select bright spots to foster a broader understanding of ongoing efforts in the Global South. Ultimately, we seek to highlight opportunities for more efficient and socially-just pathways for adoption of NbS to address urban water security in the Global South. We also recommend practical steps such as capacity building in NbS design and implementation, development of best practices and support tools, monitoring of outcomes, consideration of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM) as NbS and building partnerships for all of these with stakeholders.

1. Introduction Many urban water management activities are, at their core, centered on providing communities with safe access to water and sanitation, reducing hazard risks, and balancing infrastructure performance with ecological and social outcomes. Said differently, urban water management seeks to increase water security for city residents. While no universal definition exists [1] water security can be broadly defined as “an acceptable level of water-related risks to humans and ecosystems, coupled with the availability of water of sufficient quantity and quality to support livelihoods, national security, human health, and ecosystem services” [2–4]. In cities, water security involves the set of systems for managing waterways, moving potable and sanitary flows, recycling water, and coping with (and facilitating) natural variability [5,6]. Urban water managers apply multiple actions in pursuit of this goal, including conventional infrastructure, policy mechanisms, and nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are well-recognized as a potential strategy to achieve sustainability goals and deliver multiple co-benefits from water infrastructure and other systems with potential applications globally. NbS “leverage nature and the power of healthy ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and safeguard a stable and biodiverse future” [7]. While experts typically think about NbS from their particular disciplinary perspective [8], this and other definitions of NbS involve the integration of multiple fields in the natural and social sciences. In this review, NbS are understood as interventions inspired by nature that address societal challenges, provide multiple ecosystem services and ecological benefits, and perform infrastructure services related to water security. NbS represent a promising suite of methods for simultaneously addressing multiple societal challenges and bridging the historic divide between infrastructure planning and biodiversity conservation [9,10]. Nowhere is the promise of NbS more relevant than in regions of the so-called “Global South”. Urban areas of the Global South face water security challenges due to rapid urbanization, population growth, climate change impacts, and often inadequate infrastructure [11–13]. However, much of the current NbS literature focuses on the context of wealthier countries in developed regions and temperate climates (e.g., [14,15]), with limited research on NbS in the Global South (see for example: [16–19]. One reason for this perceived lack of NbS adoption is the use of different lexicons depending on the region and context. Some alternative terms common in the Global South include green infrastructure [20], ecological solutions, natural resource management, landscape-based solutions [21], urban greenspaces, stormwater best management practices, biological engineering, ecosystem-based adaptation, and social technology [22]. In this paper, we use the term NbS to collectively capture these actions that meet the spirit and goals of NbS but are referred to by different terms. Here, we examine the unique challenges of applying NbS to address urban water security in the Global South. Our objectives are to 1) understand the different contexts for NbS implementation between the Global South and North, 2) identify unique challenges for implementing NbS for urban water security, and 3) describe opportunities for NbS implementation by learning from“bright spots” (i.e., examples of especially successful implementation, [23] in the Global South). We acknowledge that binary terms like Global North vs. Global South, developed vs. developing, or high- vs. low-income present a false dichotomy for several reasons. For example, the magnitude and rate-of-change of development are not uniform within regions, simple economic metrics do not differentiate nuanced global differences, local context is crucial, and exceptions exist to any dichotomy [24]. However, we use these terms to draw contrasts between the context of NbS implementation for urban water security with the goal of identifying potential challenges in transfer of planning and design recommendations across these regions.

2. Approach A multi-pronged approach, based on an in-person workshop, virtual discussions, and literature review, was used to understand how NbS could address urban water security challenges in the Global South. The in-person workshop was conducted in two sessions at the Sixth Symposium on Urbanization and Stream Ecology (SUSE 6), held in Brisbane, Australia, in May 2023. A workshop proposal with the background and purpose of the workshop was used to announce andcommunicate the sessions and 12 experts registered for and participated in them. The workshop proposal is provided in supplementary documents (S1 Text). Following the in-person discussions, we conducted virtual discussions with 20 experts working across the Global South to expand the topical and geographic breadth of perspectives. Participants were selected based on expertise and regional location to encompass a range of countries within the Global South and were identified via professional networking and recommendations. They were then invited via email for a discussion session. A consistent set of topics were covered with all participants using a discussion guide. A list of discussion guide questions is provided in the supplementary document (S2 Text). Participants shared their experiences working in a diverse cross-section of countries, including the Bahamas, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and other locales. The participants also drew from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, including environmental economics and policy, landscape architecture, life sciences, anthropology, social sciences, and engineering. In addition, we conducted a literature review to supplement discussion findings. During the in-person workshop, initial insights were collected from the participants after a brief introductory presentation. Experts reflected on current practices and identified challenges and opportunities to implement NbS based on experiences in home countries, including Australia, Ethiopia, India, New Zealand, Niger, the Philippines, and the United States of America. Participants discussed key topics in smaller breakout sessions and reconvened with the large group to reflect. An interactive online discussion platform (Miro) was used to collect input and notes during the workshop and to facilitate the discussion. Participant inputs were then summarized into the themes of challenges and opportunities. The virtual discussions were conducted in two phases. First, discussions were conducted in small groups (one-to-one or a maximum of two participants). Then, a more extensive group discussion was conducted with the experts who wanted to become involved in the development of this manuscript. Audio recordings and manual note-taking were used to collect data during these discussions. Informed consent was given by all participants before data collection. The findings from the SUSE 6 conference workshop and the data collected from experts’ interviews were synthesized and cross checked. The findings from virtual discussions were summarized by the Author team using the interactive online platform (Miro) and combined with workshop input. The findings from the workshops and virtual discussion were analyzed thematically, resulting in four categories: environmental; socio-economic and perceptional; capacity, knowledge and expertise; and management and governance. In addition to the qualitative, lived experience and professional expertise represented in these dialogs, we conducted a review based on targeted literature search of NbS practices to cross-validate and support the discussion findings. The review included peer-reviewed journal articles and “gray literature” (conference proceedings, reports, etc.) on urban water security and NbS practices from both the Global South and North to understand contrasting practices and opportunities for knowledge sharing. We organized our search around urban water security NbS and specific search terms used in Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science™ are provided in the supplementary file (S3 Text). The resulting set of literature was analyzed to cross-validate discussion themes and findings and identify additional challenges and opportunities. Combined discussion and literature review findings were checked again by sending the final draft of the paper to workshop participants for their review and input. We collated “bright spots” as unique opportunities to further learn from regional practices and support the findings. All efforts were made to support regional and disciplinary representation for the in-person workshop and virtual discussions. However, gaps inevitably remain. Further, since most of the participants are from academia, the authors acknowledge the lack of certain voices, such as practitioners, government representatives, and city planners.

4. Summary This article is a response to a scholarly body of literature that focuses on NbS in the Global North and the implicit assumptions that this knowledge is equally applicable to other regions of the globe. The highlighted bright spots direct attention to the considerable NbS work currently undertaken in the Global South. The challenge, therefore, is two-fold: to develop a broader scholarly appreciation for ongoing work in the Global South and to incorporate this knowledge into a generalized understanding of the roles, pathways, and possibilities of NbS across theglobe. Although some obstacles are particularly salient in the Global South, many of these also exist within the Global North, even if to a lesser or different degree. Learning that draws from multiple contexts contributes to more robust understanding and can lead to greater creativity in the planning, design, and implementation of NbS. NbS systems can potentially provide Global South regions a pathway to enhance urban water security and achieve SDGs. However, the integration of NbS with conventional infrastructure systems is a prerequisite for effectiveness and viability, and this requires collaboration across disciplines from ecology to civil engineering and across institutions from researchers to practitioners. Leveraging local and Indigenous knowledge and involving local communities in the planning and implementation process is crucial for the success of NbS.in addition to increasing the likelihood of socially just and publicly supported projects. NbS planning in the Global South countries could approach problems from a climate-change adaptation and co-benefits perspective that considers biodiversity conservation, social vulnerability reduction, environmental justice, and Indigenous customs and knowledge preservation. A close scrutiny of the evolving political economy, political, and spatial ecology dimensions of NbS in the context of urbanization and urban development priorities would be useful. Since NbS practices have a relatively smaller track record in the Global South, incorporating NbS conceptual frameworks and best practices across education levels may increase the incorporation of these practices in future development and implementation. Including NbS in urban planning policy and planning NbS in portfolios rather than single projects in isolation would be a great approach. Also, understanding the benefits of NbS for urban resilience would help planners and decision makers maximize the implementation of NbS in their cities. Also, financial allocation support and funding for climate adaptation based on ecosystems (i.e., NbS) is needed to overcome financial barriers. This paper outlines the challenges and opportunities for implementing NbS in the Global South. Building on the findings outlined above, it is crucial to consider actionable steps to address the identified challenges. The following recommendations are proposed. Practical recommendations A regional best practices manual and a dynamic portal for NbS for water security could be developed that includes biophysical, ecological, hydrological and environmental justice dimensions to guide donors, corporates, government agencies and civil society organizations.

New curricula on NbS in teaching and training of city engineers, urban planners, and landscape architects would be required for scaling up adoption of NbS in city planning and development.

Mapping of potential NbS sites in cities based on integration of blue, green, and grey infrastructure and potential beneficiaries would help decision makers and developers make informed decisions

Investment in independent monitoring of environmental and social variables as part of project design and implementation to assess performance of NbS and learn reasons for success and failure would enable improvement and accountability.

Partnerships among governments, NGOs, academia, private sectors, local communities, and financial sectors to jointly develop and implement NbS projects may result in fewer trade-offs and enhance synergies amongst stakeholders.

Other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM) where conservation of biodiversity is achieved as a co-benefit of land-use outside protected areas offers opportunities for linking water security for cities to national and global ecosystem and biodiversity conservation targets.

UNITED NATIONS, May 29 2025 (IPS) - The humanitarian situation in Haiti has deteriorated significantly in the recent weeks as rates of violence, hunger, and displacement soar amid a severe lack of funding. As armed gangs continue to seize more territory in the capital, Port-Au-Prince, as well as in areas in the Artibonite and Centre Department, humanitarian organizations have found themselves unable to keep up with the growing scale of needs.



Haiti is considered to be one of the poorest countries within the western hemisphere and relies heavily on foreign aid to fund the majority of basic services for its citizens. According to figures from ACAPS, a nonprofit organization that provides daily analysis on current humanitarian crises, the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) for Haiti had called for USD 673.8 million, 65 percent of which was contributed by the United States. Due to the Trump administration’s reduction in USAID for over 90 programs, the amount of funding Haiti receives this year could look very different.

Heightened insecurity and worsened living conditions in Haiti have resulted in a 34 percent increase in needs as this year’s HNRP calls for USD 908 million. In the first two months of 2025, the U.S. provided nearly half of all foreign aid that was committed to Haiti, totaling at nearly USD 23.1 million. ACAPS estimates project that the total HNRP will be severely underfunded this year, with the food, healthcare and protection sectors being among the most affected.

Additionally, the reduction in funding from the U.S. could have significant implications for the efficacy of the United Nations (UN) in crisis-affected nations like Haiti. Not only will the delivery of humanitarian aid be constricted, but a variety of programs that monitor impending disasters, such as climate shocks, economic downturns, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, could be terminated.

“The pullback of U.S. funding will limit the United States’ ability to shape the UN system, to maintain its leadership of UN agencies, and to put the UN tools, especially in peacemaking situations, to use. More broadly, these funding cuts will have negative repercussions for the perception of the United States around the globe,” said Allison Lombardo, a senior associate with Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Estimates from the UN indicate that armed groups in Haiti have taken control of over 90 percent of Port-Au-Prince, spurring concern from humanitarian groups that the gangs could completely override efforts from law enforcement and the state. “It’s an unsustainable catastrophe. We could lose Port-au-Prince at any time,” said Claude Joseph, the former prime minister of Haiti.

The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) states that over 1,600 civilians were killed as a direct result of gang violence in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Additionally, according to figures from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), over 60,000 people have been internally displaced since February.

William O’Neill, the UN’s independent expert on the human rights situation in Haiti, states that the rampant insecurity in the capital can be attributed to a consistent influx of firearms from the US to Haiti. According to Amnesty International, over 600,000 guns are currently in circulation, with more coming in every day.

“The gangs have access to an increasing number of high calibre weapons, and a seemingly endless supply of ammunition and some gangs have weapons that pierce armour. This is very dangerous because the Haitian National police and the multinational security support mission led by Kenya are really relying on their armoured vehicles to provide them protection,” said O’Neill.

According to figures from the World Food Programme (WFP), over 5.7 million people, or roughly half of Haiti’s population, faces acute food insecurity. 227,000 children from the ages of six months to five years, as well as numerous pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, are at risk of acute malnutrition, with over 125,000 severe cases having been recorded already.

Haiti has also experienced another surge in sexual violence in the past month. On May 3, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported the death of a six year-old girl after experiencing a rape in a displacement site in Port-Au-Prince. According to the UN, over 333 women and girls were subjected to gender-based and sexual violence in the first quarter of 2025, with 96 percent of these cases being rape. These victims have struggled to recover due to a lack of judicial and psychosocial support.

Additionally, the lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services has led to a rise in cholera cases. The UN Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, Stéphane Dujarric has said that as of May 28, there have been over 2,100 cases of cholera reported, with 28 associated deaths. Dujarric added that rates of infection are highest in densely populated areas and displacement sites.

“After the families informed us of these cases, the threat remains because no decontamination session has taken place in the camp. We lack the materials to carry out the cleaning. Where we live, we are exposed to all kinds of diseases,” said Jhonny Élysée, president of the Bois-Verna camp committee.

Due to aid deliveries being hampered by threats of gang violence, basic services have been stretched to their limits for the majority of civilians in Haiti. According to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), over 60 percent of healthcare facilities in Port-Au-Prince are nonfunctional or operate with significant shortages in personnel, funding, and medical supplies.

“The number of seriously injured patients has risen steadily over the past four weeks. Nearly 40 percent of them are women and children,” said Dr. Seybou Diarra, coordinator of MSF’s Tabarre Hospital.

“We are now creating hospital rooms in the meeting rooms. The medical teams are exhausted, and the intensification of violence around the structure complicates the conduct of our activities, as we are located next to areas that are regularly under attack, with a high risk of stray bullets…If the situation doesn’t calm down, I fear that many of the wounded will die for lack of available treatment.”
