Kenya,"USAID left a month ago, do we have ARVs in Kenya?","Someone on a different group (different website) was asking if now that USAID is gone, does kenya still have ARV medications? Like can people go for PEP? or those who are infected are they still getting their meds???

  
If not then we are about to enter an epidemic, where people infected start infecting others at a higher rate. Since for many people, when taking the medications they were less risk of infecting others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jzrn2s/usaid_left_a_month_ago_do_we_have_arvs_in_kenya/,,usaid kenya
Kenya,Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,,usaid kenya

Kenya,Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but does Homa Bay not have the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya. Shouldn't he want organizations like USAID to keep on working in healthcare, since they supply ARVs and other stuff for cheaper rates than if we went out there and bought them ourselves.

Nimeitiwa hustle flani nikiwa hapo CBD , nayo mimi afisa mtiifu wa Generali Shillingi ya Kenya nikareport post . post ilikua hapo kamukunji.  I was given a days contract as clerk wa kudistribute  ""jst arrived"" USAID relief food , in my mind I was like this is God , I arrived in town that morning for an interview ya izi mboka za gulf .Anyways kijana nimepiga m&s zangu  za pale T2 safi , navy blue pants n a white shirt, chini  nimefunga hesabu na dark brown boots , Clarks flani I scored gikomba na bei ya Sunday (btw Sunday bei NI ya -wananchi-) .

Alright post pleasantries tume exchange na mama Mikey, ( shes the one who called me in )  nikaonyeshwa desk na mine forms pale tayari , lakini si mnajua Tu mambo ya hii serikali msongo, relief food kwa TV walishapiga picha za exchange handshake, lakini kwa ground Lori ya mikate ndo imefika pekee sasa NI tutegee Lori ya unga na mafuta iko hapo' Uhuru highway'.  

20mins wait ishageuka 3 hrs , ata wenye walikua wamekujia hio aid ikabidi warudi home na hustle kidogo afu wakam mabadae, Mimi nilitoka kwetu malaa 5:30 morning ndo nimake interview ya 8:00 anniversary towers, so pale kwa desk ya mine nishaanza kudrool , si fault yangu men, Kiti ilikua billionaire barn mesh , very comfortable thing ,miguu pale juu ya acquisition form za wenyewe,nikua Nishaanza kuota vile sasa hao clients na investors WA Kai and Karo wamehamia sasa kwa kampuni ya mine long story short niliamshwa na sauti ya glass wall ikimwagika, lakini vile hio sauti ilikua karibu I dared not open my eyes Mimi NI mgonjwa wa macho am keen to protect my eyes more than am eager to see whats happening.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Kenya,"Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

Kenya,USAID Cutoff: The Geopolitical Implications,"So far I've been reading about this and most posts in Africa cover the implications on healthcare and communities, however I'd like to discuss the Geopolitical implications. Especially in regards to the CIA.

* One most interesting use of USAID was the CIA organised fake vaccination drive to get Osama bin Laden's family DNA [guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna)

>From the article
>>As part of extensive preparations for the raid that killed Bin Laden in May, CIA agents recruited a senior Pakistani doctor to organise the vaccine drive in Abbottabad, even starting the ""project"" in a poorer part of town to make it look more authentic, according to Pakistani and US officials and local residents.

* Another is the creation of ZunZuneo: The Cuban ""Twitter"" [BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-26876801)

>From the article
>>The scheme, first reported by the Associated Press news agency, was operated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)
It is a federal international development organisation run under the aegis of the Department of State.

>>US officials then planned to introduce political messages to spur the network's users into dissent from their communist-run government, the Associated Press reports.

* USAID’s Role in Venezuela’s Opposition Movements (2000s–Present). I could only find articles from independent websites. [here](https://jacobin.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/). Most of the information comes from WikiLeaks.

> From the article
>>Unable to force Morales to do its bidding, the State Department began focusing instead on strengthening the Bolivian opposition. The opposition-controlled Media Luna region began receiving increased US assistance. A cable from April 2007 discusses “USAID’s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter-balance to the central government.”

With so much of the CIA's operations linked to USAID, I believe that with funding cut-off the CIA will have to start operating with different models to try funding capitalistic narratives and fight off communism. Much of the operations came due to the funding to USAID, with this cut-off the CIA will have to use its own budget or initiate illegal operations to fund their own operations. As such with less of a budget future CIA operations will be less complex in order to save on costs. Operations that require large time-lines e.g. Years in operation will have to reduce in scope or timelines affecting efficiency.

With the fact that the USA could deny any foreign government operations as it would be hidden under the funding of USAID, it is possible that the CIA will have to take more direct interventions resulting in such operations being see through.

What are your thoughts on this? I think it will definitely benefit current and future Pan-Africans such as Ibrahim Traore or I could be wrong and assassinations might be done in the open regardless of blow-back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ijq2tu/usaid_cutoff_the_geopolitical_implications/,,usaid funding

1. There hasn't been a budget for vaccines for newborns. What??? What the actual fuck!? Thinking about how BCG needs to be administered like within the earlier weeks of life, what do you actually mean hakuna vaccines? And the ones who can't afford private hospitals, how will those babies live?

2. There is no budget for national exams.

And guess what, the system exists ni vile inaitwa NEMIS. Sounds familiar, huh? (SHIF/NHIF)

3. I won't even touch on the Sugar Mills, the budget cuts for  the education and health sectors, the state house budgets, the new MP salary increase. Yho nishukisheni.

4. There was an idiot on Citizen news this morning defending the presidency saying 200k jobs have been created. Where? And going abroad for work isn't it. Must I go to another country to get greener pastures? Why can't we empower our own people to build here? 

Liiiiiikeee all I see is damage that will take years to undo.

Kenya,Kenya Kwanza,"There's this video on YouTube https://youtu.be/5mFSRb5dUOM?si=5gaVLrvBRMjtxiVZ

I read a book (forgot it's title, written by Kenyans and Nigerians) highlighting the same, and more, like the loans government take. It was factual with statics and provable data. One example was how Nigerian government got AID, misappropriated and only 10% of it went to the actual use. Yet, that same amount of money wasn't 1% of the national budget.


Has anyone read that book or is possession of it? What's your opinion on the video and USAID being shutdown.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jfjh3u/kenya_kwanza/,,usaid budget cut

Kenya,Freelance 101 - Kenyan edition,"So I thought to make this post to those curious about freelancing and also to my fellow freelancers - to avoid getting screwed over by clients. I'll lean especially to the latter because I've been screwed over personally and the guys curious about freelancing can follow along, you can pick a thing or two.

Also, I'm a software engineer. Regardless, what I'll say will cut across different freelance niches.

The Nevers (Do Nots):
```
1. Never pick up a project, or rather start one, without discussing the payment contract. In writing. Yes, both you and the client should have a copy of the payment contract - for both of y'all's sakes. This payment contract (freelance contract, whatever you want to call it) should list the client's expectations - that is, the scope of work, the requirements, etc. Basically everything that you, as the freelancer, should do within the client's budget. This is to avoid overworking or being underpaid - more on that later on.

2. Never start working on a project without receiving the deposit. Again, this should be stated in the contract. Ideally, the deposit should be half of the total payment. Think of it as a commital fee, to show that the client is serious. If it's a big project, yes, still receive the deposit but split the rest of the payments into milestones, that is, after doing milestone A, you're to receive a portion of the remainder payment.

I can't stress the first 2 enough.

3. This is subjective, but don't turn down a gig either because the client's budget is low or because you think you're under qualified. If the budget is too low, revise the client's expectations and show him/her what can be done with his/her budget. If you're under qualified, you're allowed to bite off more than you can chew (but wisely, not blindly) - it's also how you learn by taking on bigger intimidating projects. While still on being under qualified, who said you have to do the work alone? Outsource to your friends (who are in the same field and skilled to take the project on) or whoever you know can take on that project. Again, enter into a contract with the person you've outsourced. This way, if a project is beyond you, you still get a portion of the money by splitting with whoever you've outsourced.

4. Do not operate like a charity. After sales services? Maintenance work? Updates? If those are not stated in your contract, you're not obliged to do them post-work. Ladies and gentlemen, this is where I'd love to introduce what I love to call a ""maintenance fee"" or a ""retainer"". If you've worked a sales job, you know very well what a retainer is. If you've entered into a big project and you know after you're done, you're not really done and there's some things that need to be done regularly, this is where a maintenance fee/retainer comes in. For example, you've built an e-commerce site and the client needs to be adding more products occasionally. That's not your work, it's his/hers. Yes, during the contract, you might state that you'll do like 20 product placements, but that's it. Anything more, the client has to pay you for it. Same with a blog site. The site needs regular updates or something's broken, yes, the client has to pay. And for goodness' sake, do offer training to your client post-work on how to use what you built for him/her.
```

The Do's:
```
1. For crying out loud, do clearly define the scope of work. Yes, this includes the number of revisions too. A revision is a deviation/change from the original agreed piece of work. You've designed something, the client starts telling you the ""oh's"" ""oh, can you change this?"", ""oh can you add this?"", etc etc. Yes, revisions are unavoidable but do clearly state in your contract's scope of work, how many revisions you're willing to do within the project budget. Anything past that will incur additional costs. Remember, you're not a charity (I mean, unless you are).

2. Do charge for designs/mockups. No, not a template you stole (borrowed) from somewhere and are showing it to the client. This is for those clients where you're designing or building something from scratch. For graphic designers, well, this falls under revisions. For developers and/or other designers. This is the design that the system/project will follow. If UI/UX guys are paid, who says that you, as a developer should do the design for free?

3. Do overstate the project timeline. You can finish the project in a week? Nice, but don't say that you can. You know your capabilities. Stretch that timeline by a couple of days (or weeks) to give yourself a breathing room. Even if you can finish it in 3 days, you're not showing off to anyone. Calm your horses. Bonus: that way, you can work on something else in the meantime.

4. Do have a portfolio ready. Past projects you've done. Testimonials. etc.
```

Where the big money's at?
```
1. Team up: So you've been rawdogging things alone. Sometimes it's dry and no referrals are coming your way. This is where you form a team to tackle on projects together. The team should have complimentary skill sets. For a web design team, there's the designer, the front end guy and the back end guy, for example. In the beginning, yes, you're doing everything by yourself but your client base will only be ever so big. With a team, clients can trust you more and you're able to attract bigger clients. And of course, please for the love of everything that's good, let there be someone in your team who's good at PR/marketing - basically someone who's well connected to look for clients. That guy doesn't even have to be as technical as you but trust you me, you'll appreciate having such a guy versus not.

2. Skill up. Research. Seriously, you can't be crying that what you're doing isn't paying enough but truth be told, the same skillet you had when you started is still the same one that you're using and oh my goodness, you're expecting better pay and better clients? Insanity? Doing the same thing expecting different results. Want more money? Research what's paying more and learn that and then start doing it. KISS (no, I didn't kiss you... That's me telling you to Keep It Simple, Stupid. Respectfully).
```

How do I get clients?
```
Wouldn't we all like to know? If you know something, please do share. I mean that seriously, and sarcastically. But uh, speak to more people, connect with more people, and put yourself (and your skill sets) out there. You never know who's listening or who you'll meet. They might just be your next client.
```

Familiarity (working with close friends/family/relatives):
```
1. Family: Don't be a jerk to them. Do what you can for them. Actually, these are the best people to test your skills with. With an outsider, you can't fuck around and not find out. With family, you can. And you'll grow. Seriously, don't underestimate family. Some of your next clients will come from them. And I'm not saying this lightly.

2. Close friends: I'll keep it simple. Work with their budget. Next.

3. Relatives: Treat them as outsiders. Refer to the Nevers and the Do's. Well, not always. Depending on your relationship, some relatives are like family and thus almost similar benefits. But that random cousin/aunt/uncle - do treat them as outsiders.
```

This was pretty subjective. Based on personal experience. Based on what I've seen and heard from other freelancers.

Kenya,These seven African countries will be hit the hardest by Trump's cuts at USAID,,https://www.semafor.com/article/02/12/2025/countries-worst-hit-by-usaid-cuts,,usaid budget cut
Kenya,USAID and Self reliance,"USAID has been scrapped and a section of Kenyans and Africans are largely celebrating the move claiming it will lead to self reliance and all that,which to be clear is a good thing, a lofty Ideal.

But I can't help but notice something those making those tik toks and tweets are mainly urban, middle class folks, you know the kind of people who probably don't rely on USAID for survival. Now since we can't build capacity to manufacture vaccines and ARVs immediately even if we wanted to and don't get me started on changing our leadership, fighting corruption and all that...none of that can happen immediately, it may take years ,perhaps even decades. My question to them is ,How many infants are you willing to see die of measles, malnutrition, polio etc in your quest for self reliance? Is it 1? 10? 100? 1000? 10,000? 100,000? How many lives are worth sacrificing for self reliance?

Now if you haven't been about the country, it may be easy to read some article in a newspaper or a tweet claiming that this professor or that think tank did a research that found aid doesn't reach their intended target and take it as gospel truth ,you may even retweet some retards' claims that the UN is useless,UNICEF is useless, WHO is useless and all that, but those of you who have been in distressed and conflict ridden areas know how absolutely crucial USAID and the UN are.

An example during the height of the last drought an estimated 4 mn Kenyans were at risk of starvation, now if you budget kes 150 for every individual per day i.e food ,distribution and administrative costs that's about 600 mn kes per day or 18bn per month. Inevitably someone will come and say but 'we lose 2bn to corruption everyday', 'we can grow our own food (completely ignoring the fact that areas that are hit hardest by famines are normally populated by nomadic pastoralists and telling them to grow their own food or practice zero grazing entails a huge lifestyle change which again takes time) and all those talking points they seem to have, but these are long term fixes but now we need a solution Now since people's lives are at risk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ii3qam/usaid_and_self_reliance/,,usaid budget cut
Kenya,Freelancing is hard sometimes,"I'm a UI/UX designer and last year this dev i work with had a client who needed a website for their business designed. I had a discovery call with the client so I could get more info and then after I told the dev that the client's budget wasn't enough for the work she needed. He convinced me to just take the job and help the business get started to which I agreed. 

The work was done, payment was completed and I handed over to the dev. And the website was successfully launched.

I retained the client's contact and later I'd see them post their private life (their family seems wealthy). And even got to discover that they were in tech and earning well from it.

Which meant that this person could afford to pay us well but chose not to. Weeks later the client gave me a call and told me they had a potential client then asked how much I'd give them as a cut if they referred me. Man nilishangaa bana bc wtf is that. 

How do you lowball someone then have the audacity to ask for a cut if you refer them? Eventually, they ghosted and that lead went cold after they noticed I wasn't up for being exploited but since then I've learnt my lesson.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i6fzzn/freelancing_is_hard_sometimes/,,usaid budget cut
Kenya,Conspiracy theorists assemble,"I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like reading them and I like thinking about possible conspiracy theories. The current one I am thinking about is Ruto deliberately sabotaged Raila’s AUC bid so that Raila can still be useful to him in local politics. If Raila won the chairmanship, the broad based government and narrative would have become less important for his coalition and as a result, Raila would not activate his local political networks to keep Ruto in power. 

How have those networks been utilised since the coalition? All protests have been infiltrated by “goonz”. Is this just a coincidence? You tell me.

The goonz have been extremely successful in dissuading young kenyans from protesting. The protests last year were gaining momentum and threatened to reach unprecedented levels until the goonz came in. Now every protest is overrun by goonz.

By disrupting protests, Ruto is hoping to lessen the negative press his administration is facing, safeguard his position and further solidify his budding authoritarian regime. The networks he gained through the coalition have been crucial in doing that.

If Raila won the AUC seat, I believe his focus would have been on his new role and it would have also undermined his leadership if his home country is at the forefront of committing human rights violations which is what Ruto’s administration would continue to do to deal with the protests. So what does Ruto and his aides do? Make the most outlandish statements before the AUC elections that weaken Kenya’s position amongst member states, costing Raila the seat and ensuring the only thing that will keep him occupied is the bread based government.


That is my theory.

Feel free to call it story za Jaba because like I said, I like conspiracy theories and I find them an interesting way to try and analyze the madness going on in this country.

Kenya,Kenyans in Diaspora,"I have recently been digging into challenges that Kenyans in diaspora face while investing in real estate and construction here in Kenya. Some include trusting incompetent relatives to manage their developments and falling into offplan scams. Whereas there are others who have successfully managed to invest with less issues. 

In regards to this, I have been keen on trying to come up with a turnkey construction solution where there is a firm that offers investment packages for enthuastic Kenyans in diaspora as well as foreigners. The packages include Design-Build, Design-Build-Operate and Build only. I believe offering a trustworthy construction  and project manager who will ensure proper management of their remittances and provide timely and efficient progress reports and milestones reports is probably what they need. In collaboration with a team of a law firm, a trusted real estate firm and maybe a few contruction works subcontractors, I think it would work and I will be able to facilitate their dream of becoming property owners.

Kenya,Missgivings of AfriCOG and Okoa Uchumi's(TISA) in their latest report - Stealing the Future,"Link to doc -> https://africog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Stealing-the-Future.pdf

**1st** missgiving are pleadings and/or pandering to defunct/institutions seeking relevance, since ~1973, referred to as Bretton Woods. No country has ever come out of their ""Structural Adjustment Programs(SAPs)"" stronger economically, socially or politically.

**2nd** is a great ignorance of how modern monetary system works. Kenya needs NOT borrow in foreign currencies as she has her own called the Kenyan Shilling(KES). These borrowing expose serious structural problems in the jurisdiction called Kenya.

**3rd** is an austerity bias for fiscal policy which is an echo of Bretton Woods advice. KE gov't, entity with 22-23% of GDP, has recently cut her spending by ~2% of GDP or KES ~400 Billion. Results have been growth figures of 4.6% & 4.0% respectively for 2024 fiscal quarters Q1(July - Sept 2024) & Q2(Oct - Dec 2024). KNBS has refused with Q3 data i.e Jan - April 2025. Does any Kenyan want a continuation of this? Macro-Economics 1st/**golden rule** is that one sector's spending is another's income. Cut spending, cut incomes, cut output and finally employment.

**4th** is a complete ignorance or denial of Balance of Payments(BoP). It's NOT just here but also in recent talks, a running theme?, hosted by University of Nairobi where there's little mention of this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tifBvwAfo . Report launched in the livestream - https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099052625075532839 . Fiscal sustainability ""problems"" as we've established are frankly **nonesense** as KE has & is the monopoly of her own currency. It can never run out of it! It's ONLY KE gov't that can *print*/issue this currency! Just try and counter-feit KES & you'll see magnitude of charges racked against you! At ratios  of ~200+% for external(foreign currency) public & publicly guaranteed(**PPG**) debts to exports this isn't sustainable! Source for this is KE Treasury's Draft MTDS(Medium Term Debt Strategy) for 2025 page 20 - https://www.treasury.go.ke/medium-term-debt-management-strategy/. Capital accounts supposed to counter the current account(trade deficits) are very weak.

**4.1** Certian items, food/core staples, in current account(part of Balance of Payment's) are specifically worrying. Imports are definitely a plus as they build onto what KE produces(*KE's pile of stuff*) however on key/strategic issues it's NOT feasible. Food/core staples represent ~17% of total imports & are valued at USD ~5 Billion or approx ~8 months of fuel/energy related imports. These are **National Security** items which is shocking the ideology/philosophy being adopted that of *food security*(you can buy your food) Vs **food sovereignity**(you must produce your own food). I discuss this in a recent comment & the frauds/damned lies Vs reality - https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kmg8ye/we_never_learn/mslfbsk/

**4.2** I'd dare say the syndicated borrowings, Eurobonds & so termed budgetary support by IMF are directed to these 2 huge items that take ~30% of all imports i.e food and fuel.

**5th** is about flows of corruption/theft popularly given a figure of KES ~2 Billion daily. Well these monies are entering/remaining & swimming around in KE's financial/monetary system. ""Borrowings"" in local currency are the same as taxes & other **impositions**. They are **ex-post** i.e happen after the fact. With ~800 Billion in pending bills and weak capital accounts(no.4 above) there's NO other source that can explain the bid-cover ratios seen for issues and re-openings of short(t-bills) & long tenure(Infrastructure bonds etc) gov't securities.

**5.1** More supporting evidence of the above stolen/pilfered funds swimming around in the same pond. [Commercial] Banks have seen huge & consistent growths of their **liability** side i.e customer's **deposits** to the tune of 6.7 Trillion or 19.3% of GDP in 2024 from 5.2 Trillion in 2023 and 4.1 Trillion in 2022. These mandated sources of capital(deposits), by CBK, are both NOT costless & risk free(bank runs) hence banks must invest/park them in risk free & stable vehicles to offset their risks & operational costs. This is the popular trope that *""banks thirst for gov't debt""* or *""banks are lending to gov't and not private sector""*. But where are these deposits coming from given the two sources above being insufficient or curbed? No money gets lost in a system!

**5.2** There's nothing like a crowding out of private sector in a country running deficits of ~6-7% of GDP. These are **risk-free** & **stable** assets to **private sector**! What is evidenced here is a **distributional problem**(in soft language) or if like outright theft!. A continuation of the 1970's and 1980's second crisis of Economic theory between the two Cambridges.

**6th** Is a dismisal/lack of appreciation NOT only voiced in this document but by many prominent Kenyans. It's statements that KE gov't MUST get the hell out of the way. This includes basic and/or **natural monopoly** items such as energy, critical infrastructures for communication & transport etc. The characterization is that gov'ts do NOT produce and/or stimulate anything. That ""markets"" always ""stabilize""/get things back into **""equilibrium""** by themselves. I do NOT know if this comes from KE churning out only output & expenditure-based statistics of **National Accounts**. For the latter gov't or institutional sectors data is NOT yet compiled - 2. Methodology from https://dsbb.imf.org/e-gdds/dqaf-base/country/KEN/category/NAG00. **FYI** You can calculate GDP via 3 approaches - **Income**(sources of funds), **Expenditure**(uses of funds) & **Output**(production of goods/services). To dispell myths that gov'ts are nothing but leaches there is Mariana Mazzucato's book - **The Entreprenurial State**.

**7th** Last but not least is classic identification/pointing out of a problem without any solutions by **AfriCOG & TISA**. Exchequer releases/**gazettements** that happen ~1-1.5 months are NOT adequate. They must be more frequent(daily statements like US's Daily Treasury Statement aka The **DTS**) and more granular(dis-aggregation/lower levels below **vote heads** showing things like receipts, invoices etc). There's a system in the works if you listen to **KE Treasury** & associated folk however recent history does NOT bode well. I'm talking of the stalled/failed **digital land registry system** dubbed **""Ardhisasa""** that has largely ground to a halt after it's pilot phase. Can we expect anything of the pending/yet to be implemented **Treasury Single Account**(TSA) system by KE gov't?

Kenya,"Abortion in Kenya: A Clash of Policies, Culture, and Beliefs.","Let’s cut through the hypocrisy.

You’ve heard the sermons, the moral grandstanding, the “pro-life” slogans. Meanwhile, 2,600 Kenyan women die yearly from unsafe abortions—and it’s not because they’re “immoral.” It’s because our laws, foreign meddling, and stigma are failing them.  

Here’s the brutal truth: 

1. The Law is a Trap

- Constitution says: Abortion is legal to save a woman’s life or health (including rape/incest).
 
- Penal Code says: Abortion is a crime. Providers face 14 years in jail; women, 7 years.

- 2023 Malindi ruling: Courts called this BS, affirmed abortion as a fundamental right. But MPs and cops still harass providers and patients.  

Translation: If you’re raped, you must beg a doctor to risk arrest to save you.  

2. Unsafe Abortions = Silent Epidemic

21,000 women hospitalized yearly from botched procedures (think: bleach, coat hangers, quacks). 

Cost of “choice” 

  - Safe clinic: 20,000 KES ($160) – more than most earn in a month.  
  - Backstreet hack: 2,500 KES ($20) – and maybe your life.
  
Who dies? Poor women. Always.  

3. The U.S. is Fueling This Disaster

 Trump’s Global Gag Rule slashed funding for clinics offering abortion info. Result? Closed health centers, fewer contraceptives, MORE unsafe abortions.

 Kenya’s Ministry of Health caved to U.S. pressure, scrapping safe abortion guidelines in 2013. Courts ordered their return—still ignored.  

Fun fact: U.S. Christian groups fund Kenyan anti-abortion lobbyists to push their agenda.  

4. Stigma Kills More Than Laws

“Crisis pregnancy centers” (funded by U.S. evangelicals) lie to women: “Abortion causes cancer!”

Religious leaders shame survivors of rape: “Carry the baby—God’s plan!”

Doctors refuse care, fearing arrest or judgment.  

What You Can Do

1. Demand MPs reform the Penal Code– Align it with the Constitution.

2. Donate to RHNK(Reproductive Health Network Kenya) – They train providers and fight for rights.

3. Call out stigma– Share facts, not sermons.

4. Comment below: “How would YOU navigate this system if you were a pregnant rape survivor?”

“This isn’t about ‘morality’—it’s about power. Who controls women’s bodies? Politicians? Preachers? Or WOMEN THEMSELVES?”

Kenya,"Are there Kenyans who are into FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)?","FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a big movement in the West, especially among high-income millennials and tech workers, where people aggressively save and invest to leave formal employment in their 30s or 40s.

I'm curious: what would FIRE look like in Kenya?

If you're working towards early retirement:

•	How are you making your money?

•	Where are you investing — SACCOs, land, property, money market funds, foreign stocks?

Kenya,Racism - how often do you as a Kenyan feel racially attacked?,"I have lived half of my life in Kenya. I've just returned to Kenya and after living abroad in developed countries, my perspective is pretty different now.

I grew up with an Indian ethnic background so it felt normal at the time but now, I have realized that most indians in Kenya are pretty racist towards black Kenyans. They don't pay well, they don't treat them like humans at work places, and worst of all, there's no trust amongst anyone.

I understand that Kenya is ridden with poverty and there's a huge disparity in income and wealth. The amount of corruption in the government prevents them from setting up financial aids for people with disabilities, for people who have lost a job, for health issues, whatever it may be, it's lacking.
This further increases the struggle in this country so I find that everyone is grinding and always seeking ways to make money even if it's ""chai"" 50-100kshs.

However, I find that the racism goes both ways and I can't exactly place the blame on any single race or single person. It's been happening for generations and it's just a norm unfortunately.

Indians who have money or are employers always make the decisions to pay less (not even minimum wage), they don't give work safety equipment or maintain facilities to a standard.

On the other hand, black Kenyans only look at indians as a way to make money and nothing more.

I went out for a walk this week and got approached like 20 times at the very least where people stare at me or my clothes or whatever it may be, they approach and beg for money or try force me to buy things even if I've said I'm not looking to buy.

If people were to call the police on racism or unfair treatment, all that happens is the police will ask for a bribe and it'll get swept under the rug, likely the black Kenyan will get fired anyway and be at a loss with no justice.

If we want Kenya to progress as a country, this shit needs to stop. Police gotta be more righteous and stop with the bribery and actually enforce rules. I notice most police don't do any actual work, they go around looking for ways to extort people for money. It could be a simple traffic thing like at the roundabouts near town, there's no need for this. Use these resources more wisely.

I remember back in 2014 I was trying to get my ID but I lost the original. I had to go get an obstruct from the police station and they said to me ""why do you think you can just get us to give you an obstruct if you can't pay us"" and I'm thinking nahhh you're a public servant, not a paid service.. and then when I go back to the ID office, the same guy who asked me to get an obstruct tells me why did you bother doing all this when you could've just paid me some money and I'd have fastracked the process for u without needing an obstruct.

It's literally in every situation. I wanna know what you guys think and if I'm being ridiculous or if there really needs to be a change. Btw I haven't even scratched the surface of what other shit goes on in this country on a daily basis. So much theft and corruption on top of the racism. 

Edit- I apologize for using ""black Kenyans"" when referring to native Kenyans. I don't mean to offend anyone but I'm glad people called me out on this, this discussion/post is for all of us to learn and treat each other better; to increase awareness and get our thoughts provoked into understanding what we need to change about ourselves, eventually (ideally rather), we can slowly start making a difference in how we approach other humans",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kq6n2s/racism_how_often_do_you_as_a_kenyan_feel_racially/,,kenya foreign aid

Portugal, the USA, your Brexit isle, Italy, Hungary, Mexicans are tired of Americans taking over the Roma district and Oaxaca.  Costa Rica, Panama all tired of foreigners…. all tired of digital nomads.

And on and on. Namibia, South Africa and now Kenya and everywhere. Canadians are tired of Indian immigrants. Minnesota tired of Somalis, Zimbabweans annoying South Africans by flooding in. Nigerians annoying everyone everywhere they go. Arabs flooding France. Pakistanis and Bengalis dirtying the UK, Afghans and Syrians sexually abusing German women…

So the fact that many Kenyans are tired of all of you immigrants or fake ‘expats’ or real expatriates (who never want to leave when your contracts are completed), or you phony missionaries who come here to corrupt people with your religions, or you foreign pedophiles opening “children’s homes”, or you passport bros, or you silly African Americans with your YouTube channels and coloniser mentality offering ‘consultation’ and ‘relocation’ services to a country you think belongs to you (you belong in your West African ancestral land)….

You are not special.

You are just like any other immigrants around the world of any color who are disturbing the local populace.

And this Kenyan local populace is starting to behave like the populace in YOUR home country that doesn’t want any more immigrants.

Kenyans are not docile. We are not background characters in your relocation adventures for your YouTube channels and Instagram stories.

We are just like any other people who are tired of foreigners.

The entire planet is shifting. Established societies are falling apart. There is strife.

Kenya,International teacher salary in Kenya,"Hey all,

So I am a Mzungu foreign teacher.  I currently have a largely online teaching job at a school in the US.  This enables me to escape to Kenya for a handful of months per year (but, working US hours in Nairobi gets long fast).

The good part, obviously, is the US pay (I make about 500k/month in ksh).

The political climate in the States is totally going to crap and things are happening that I really do not support or agree with... We are definitely in the process of falling under an authoritarian regime and little can be done to stop the momentum by this point.  I absolutely want to leave this country on a more permanent basis than my 2 month trips.

I have looked into moving to Colombia and have a few contacts there at international schools that pay very well for the area (just shy of US$2K/mo... 250k ksh/mo).

I am also interested in spending a year or two teaching in Kenya and was wondering about the salary for international teachers?  I would be coming with about 3.5 M ksh in liquid savings, and another 7 M ksh in stocks (if need be).  I could also rent out my US home for, hopefully, some additional revenue.  Could I make it work without using too much of my liquid savings??

FTR, I teach high school science.  I have visited my friend's nephew's elementary school one time to pick him up in Mukuru (Nairobi) before and saw what the teachers had to work with... Not sure if that's due to location, elementary school level, or anything about the market for international, licensed teachers.

Does anyone in here have any experience that they could share??

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kbtutb/international_teacher_salary_in_kenya/,,kenya foreign aid
Kenya,"Not all skin folks are kin folks: Black American state operatives, espionage against Africans, for white power structures.","
This is an example of one of the many black American kin folks under pentagon/state department rats working for white power structure against Africans. He started his espionage assignment in 1996 in Senegal, then later moves to Uganda where he camouflaged as a music teacher and singer until 2019.

His job, in his own words, “was to spot, assess, develop, and recruit spies to help our nation."" 

These are the kind of rats that have no conscience in helping white supremacists maintain their control and continue keeping black Americans down through systemic assassination of black American rights activists like Malcolm X and Martin Luther. 


In the ideal world, black Americans would be valuable resource to Africa in terms of tourism, capital and skills. They posses unique experience and exposure. However, looking at how they've systematically backstabbed their own back home, it's a guarantee these people will be no different here. 
In fact, it is almost certain they they are going to work against us, even more confidently and treacherous than their white folks. Skin colour gives them unchallenged advantages in matters espionage. They can easily blend in. Black, they look like us, they are our people, king lost kins. Most importantly, the average African mind does not immediately suspect them, nor sees them as potential enemies in national, political and economic matters compared to white males who are the embodiment of white supremacism, colonialism, treachery, murder and plunder of the Africa. These makes black Americans unparalleled capabilities for espionage in Africa, even more lethal enemies than their white counterparts. 

It's almost certain this newly-found love towards Kenya, and Africa at large, is not organic. 

To begin with, they are equally racist, if not more, to Africans compared to their white counterparts. 

Almost all of these akatas have no families, they're coming as individuals, no wife/husband, no children, no clear reason why they are ""moving"" here, no clear income generating activity. Like who are they? Are they conservationists? Are they coming for business? Are they employed? I mean, Kenya is extremely expensive, especually for foreigners.

If it were SEA countries it would be understandable. Coz if you watch YouTube videos of countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines..etc, you could get a proper ksh 100/= meal, with chicken, beef of poke, and rice on the side. Not in Kenya.

So, you ain't fooling anybody Aaliyah. We have shortage of fools. 
YouTube income cannot foot your posh ksh 50,000 per month apartment in Kilimani, Uber rides, weekly clubbing and monthly outings to Maasai Mara, Amboseli, Diani, and Watamu.

Kenya,Kenya Isn’t That Bad… Ama?,"So I have this friend who lives in Europe. Since last year, he’s been on my case:  
“Why are you still in Kenya? You could be making 300k a month over here.” He paints Europe like it's Wakanda with WiFi.  
And I’m just here like....relax, my guy.

We happened to bump into each other during his vacation here. I was out vibing like I usually do, random place, random people...and because I talk a lot, we somehow got deep into convo before I even remembered to ask for his name.

Now this guy has a whole script in his head about Kenya. Sure, things are tough, but he’s talking like I live in a mud hut with goats and chicken making a mess everywhere. I mean, yes! economy is bad, lakini hata kama! We’re not at war. We're not dodging bombs. We're just dodging bad network and inflated prices.

And then... he drops The Plan; “We could get married. Not for real, for papers. It’ll be easier for you to come to Europe that way.You can live with me while you find your footing. I’ll help until you get a job.

Ehhh?

Sir wants to marry me for logistics. Not love. Not vibes. Just… simplified relocation. He clearly watches too many K-dramas. Because this sounded like:  
— Pack your bags  
— Say goodbye to mum  
— Marry the homie  
— Live in a foreign country as a “wife”  
— Hope he stays normal until I find a job  
— And pray he doesn’t change his mind mid-process  

Skia kunipanga! Eii!! Karibu nipatwe na muhadharaa!! 
He really thought I’d say yes like I’ve been sitting here manifesting a stranger-sponsored escape plan. As if I’m a USB drive he can just eject from Kenya and plug into Europe.

And it made me think...how do some of these people see us? Like we’re all lining up to leave? That we’re desperate to escape? That we’d marry for convenience just to access greener lawns?

Sure, the country has its problems, but we’re not hopeless. We still love it here (I do, i don't know about you) There’s sunshine, there's you and a mad person that always claims not to be mad🥱. It’s madness, but it’s home.
So no! I’m not moving across continents to play “wife” in a show I didn’t audition for.

Kenya,Is There a Better Way to Fund Africa’s Infrastructure Than Foreign Debt?,"I'm researching a fintech concept rooted in a simple but powerful idea: What if African citizens could directly micro-invest in their own infrastructure and economic development — from as little as $1 — instead of relying so heavily on foreign loans or aid?

The idea is inspired by:

Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam, where despite China funding most of the $5B project, citizens contributed around $1B through bonds and mobile payments. It was a unifying act of nation-building.

Denmark’s wind cooperatives, where tens of thousands of Danes co-own wind turbines, investing small amounts and earning steady returns from green energy sales.

Arla Foods, one of the world’s largest dairy companies, is owned by thousands of farmer-members across Europe.

Park Slope Food Co-op (Brooklyn, USA) – over 17,000 members run and own this highly successful grocery store. Members contribute labor and share in decision-making and cost savings — a small-scale but high-functioning democratic economic model.

The concept:

A micro-investment platform where citizens can fund infrastructure and industrial projects such as:

Solar mini-grids

Roads, ports, water systems

Local processing plants or factories

Affordable housing

Agricultural or logistics ventures


Users invest tiny amounts (e.g. $1–$10) and track the project’s progress. They may receive a return over time or non-cash benefits (e.g. discounts, usage credits).


Why this matters:

Too often, African development is externally financed — with debt, strings attached, and little citizen engagement. This model flips that:

People co-own what they rely on

Governments gain domestic funding alternatives

Trust, pride, and engagement are built from the ground up


Challenges (based on Reddit and expert feedback):

1. Corruption and trust — Citizens must see where every dollar goes. This means transparent ledgers, project dashboards, public audits, and perhaps smart contracts.


2. Regulation hell — Securities laws differ by country. Government support or sandbox frameworks would be key.


3. Profitability — Many infrastructure projects don’t generate immediate returns. The model may need to combine financial ROI with social ROI (access, pride, service).


4. Liquidity and exits — Who buys your stake in a toll road if you need cash tomorrow?


5. ""Isn’t this just a tax?"" — Not quite. Unlike taxes, citizens choose projects and can receive returns or benefits.


What I’m exploring:

Starting with small-scale, single-country pilots (e.g. local solar or transport infrastructure)

Integrating traditional savings models like stokvels or SACCOs for community-level buy-in

Building a trust layer first: partnerships with co-ops, municipalities, development banks, etc.

Exploring hybrid returns (financial + utility discounts) and different legal structures (co-ops, trusts, SPVs)


I'm not claiming this is the silver bullet — but I do believe there's space for a new model of citizen-led development funding in Africa.

What are the biggest red flags? Where does this break down? Are there other models you think I should study or emulate?

I’d love to hear your take.

Kenya,"Like It or Not, Here's Why Ruto Will Win in 2027 (Historical Data & Political Reality Check)","CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT HERE'S THE BARE-NAKED TRUTH: Ruto will win the 2027 presidential election. Here's why:

**1. Kenya Has Never Had a One-Term President**

* Historical data shows all Kenyan presidents since 1964 have served at least two terms (Jomo Kenyatta, Moi, Kibaki, Uhuru).
* Source: [IEBC Historical Election Data](https://www.iebc.or.ke/)

**2. The Political Machinery is Already in Place**

* The older generation (35+ voters) are already locked in. They vote consistently (70%+ turnout) while youth participation remains low.
* 2022 IEBC reports show only 39% of Gen Z (18-24) had registered to vote.

**3. Economic Reality of Voting Patterns**

* Poorer demographics vote at higher rates (65% turnout in low-income areas vs 42% in middle-class areas).
* The infamous ""500 bob"" factor is real - NYS and relief funds strategically timed before elections have historically swayed votes.

**4. Regional Voting Blocs Remain Strong**

* Rift Valley delivered 78% of votes to Ruto in 2022. This base isn't eroding.
* Mt. Kenya may complain but historically votes for the incumbent (see Kibaki's 2007 re-election despite discontent).

**5. Our Neighbors Are Progressing While We Obsess Over Politics**

* Tanzania attracted **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank), while Uganda's **oil project** is projected to generate **8.1 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in **2023** (World Bank). Furthermore, Uganda's **oil project** is expected to generate **2 billion** annually, starting in **2025** (Uganda Ministry of Energy).

Meanwhile, Kenya attracted just **$1.2 billion** in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during the same period (CBK 2023 Report).

As of now, we're already in **2027 campaign mode.**

* Gen Z isn't getting IDs (only 1.2M new registrations in 2023 vs 6M eligible)
* Middle-class Kenyans will tweet but won't vote (42% turnout in urban areas)
* The poor will vote - and they'll vote for whoever meets their immediate needs

Like it or not, #TanoTena is coming. The numbers don't lie.

Kenya,Do we have a national culture?,"⚠ Warning: ***long post***

But you might want to read it cause ***this is a whole PHD thesis!***

In this post, I argue that Kenya lacks a cohesive national identity. Countries like China, the UK, and the US have strong, recognizable national cultures shaped by histories that span centuries, if not millennia. These cultures, while internally diverse, are united by shared symbols, customs, and values. The baguette, for instance, is undeniably French. Americans proudly celebrate Thanksgiving, and the British are known for their deep-rooted traditions and institutions.

Kenya, on the other hand, doesn't share this same kind of national cultural cohesion. Our country is incredibly diverse—home to over 40 ethnic groups, each with its own unique culture. But instead of this diversity forming a mosaic that strengthens a national culture, our identities remain largely fragmented along ethnic lines. And even those cultural elements that survive are often at risk of erosion.

To make matters worse, we've become so westernized that indigenous cultures are frequently viewed as inferior. Having a native accent is often mocked—we call such people ""kienyeji,"" a term that’s both derogatory and undignifying. This mindset reflects a deep-rooted colonial hangover, where we were taught to aspire to whiteness—whether in language, behavior, or even skin tone. Skin bleaching, forced accents, and the obsession with foreign norms are all symptoms of this internalized inferiority.

Yes, we have national holidays, but how many people actually celebrate them with a sense of pride or belonging? How many of us can even speak fluently in our national languages? Among young urban Kenyans, especially, the dominant culture seems to be imitation of the West rather than celebration of what is uniquely Kenyan.

And sure, Kenya is a young nation. But if we continue down this path—if we keep rejecting our roots and failing to define who we are beyond colonial remnants—we will never form a truly Kenyan identity. At the moment, the only things we seem to collectively share as a nation are negative traits: weak democratic institutions, poor governance, rampant corruption, and a relentless pursuit of wealth at the expense of others.

If we are to ever forge a national identity, it must begin with reclaiming and respecting our own cultures—seeing value in who we are and what we already have.



***TL;DR:***
Kenya lacks a strong national identity, unlike countries like the US, UK, or China. Our deep ethnic diversity has led to fragmented cultures, and colonial influence has made many of us see indigenous ways as inferior. We imitate Western culture—from accents to skin tone—while national holidays and languages barely unite us. Until we reclaim and respect our own roots, we’ll struggle to define what it truly means to be Kenyan.

Kenya,Kenya is in trouble a self inflicted Cuba,"We all know this but here is a deeper look into things:

Okay, Kenya’s corruption and the impunity surrounding it have thrown the country into economic conditions that closely mirror what happened to Cuba starting in 1962, when the U.S. slapped a full embargo on trade. The impact? Devastating economic retribution that crippled Cuba’s growth and sent it into long-term decline. That’s exactly what we’re seeing play out in Kenya right now.

If you want to know where Kenya is headed, just study Cuba’s past or take a close look at Venezuela. History is a mirror. Economics is not guesswork—it’s a science. When the same conditions are in place, the outcomes follow predictable patterns.

The Kenyan shilling is already weakening—and it’s not stopping there. What follows is what always follows: rising inflation, skyrocketing cost of living, collapsing public services, and widespread unemployment. Just like Venezuela, Kenya is headed into a storm of debt, capital flight, and a brain drain, where the educated and skilled seek stability elsewhere. Investment dries up. Confidence disappears. People lose hope.

Both Cuba and Venezuela also saw their currencies become almost meaningless, imports become luxuries, and public trust in institutions completely erode. Kenya is now walking that same path—except this time, it’s not a foreign embargo doing the damage. It’s our own doing. The corruption, the theft, the lack of consequences—it’s an internal embargo. And the price that Kenya is paying and will continue to pay is high.

Guys, this are not just some historical accounts but a stern warning. It seems like Kenya country is already in a sharp decline.

Supporting sanctioned group accused of Genocide

>On January 7, 2025, the U.S. government sanctioned RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Dagalo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, for his role in destabilizing Sudan and obstructing its democratic transition. Earlier, on September 6, 2023, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned his brother, Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo, for leading the RSF, whose members have committed atrocities, including massacres, ethnic killings, and sexual violence.

Kenya’s decision to host the RSF in Nairobi to form a parallel government is a grave violation of its international obligations, including the UN Charter, the AU Constitutive Act, and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Moreover, this move undermines Sudan’s sovereignty, constitutes an act of hostility against its people, and disregards the immense suffering of countless Sudanese civilians and ongoing peace efforts.

Kenya,Kenyan Startup environment and what can be done,"I'm sure most of us are fully aware of the frustrations Kenyans are facing in the startup ecosystem. Potential entrepreneurs and innovators struggling to get funding in what seems to be a space dominated by foreign founders.

From my 2+ years being in the thick of things in the space, I can boil it down to VCs and their choice of investments. We all know most VCs are funded by global north investors who have become so accustomed to the silicon valley model of hype and scaling. Most startups in Kenya are not profitable because most of these founders have this 'visionary technologist' mindset that they are the ones who know what Africa needs. They barely do any market research to understand the actual problems to solve but try to replicate silicon valley 'successes' which often don't translate because we are not yet a convenience economy. That's why most startups are often in the fintech, carbon markets, logistics, etc, fields. Because such fields can fit into the techpreneurs narrative of fast growth even if their business cases aren't profitable, which is largely unsustainable, hence the failures we see.

The unfortunate thing, however, is that it works for the VCs, investors and generally majority share holders. These foreigners are used to pitching potential future growth and market dominance, with VCs drinking the kool aid and stuffing them with money, because all they care about is company valuations. If the valuation gets high enough, doesn't matter if the company made any profit or solved any problem, shareholders can cash out in exits (like a pump and dump with extra steps). Since most funding comes from abroad, it thus becomes quite hard for a Kenyan founder who might not be pitching the same level of growth and hype but has ideas that can help the country's existential problems e.g., in agriculture, water access, healthcare, housing, etc., (as shown in the UN's SDGs), given that some of these areas don't fit into the tech hyper-scaling ethos.

As someone irritated by this, I want to start my own venture (manufacturing and process engineering) but I'm highly skeptical about funding from VCs. I've managed to build a strong technical background and network, but still have questions on raising capital. There's been a lot of talk around our local financing systems, some of them being surprisingly impactful like chamas. I'm curious to know whether there are entrepreneurs here who've gone through the same struggles and have even managed to raise from/know of local systems of raising capital that help solve our problems and keep the monetary gains within the country. I'm also aware of a Startup bill (don't know whether it was passed) that supports local startups as long as they are fully Kenyan-owned and use at least 15% of their income on R&D. Do we by chance have Kenyan-founder networks or forums that can support each other on this?

Kenya,Possible Kenya Winter Trip,"Hey guys. I'm starting to think of what I might want to put on my travel to-do list in early 2026. I have not remotely decided yet but right now, Kenya is on my short list. 

I'd want to spend at least a month there, with most of that time likely being in Nairobi. I would want this to be in the winter, as it's a big priority for me to get out of the US that time of year. 

Tbh though, I'm a little over my head with this destination compared to others I've been to in the past, making it difficult to get concrete answers on key questions I have about the country. So, forgive me if these have been asked here before: 

1. Are there any major safety concerns in Nairobi as someone who is a clear foreigner? (Not black essentially) 
2. What is nightlife like in Nairobi and is it safe to indulge in it? 
3. I'd look to do as affordable of a safari trip as possible while there. Is under $1K USD reasonable if I didn't need luxury accommodation and only wanted to do 3-4 days? 
4. I've heard a little bit about Mombasa but mainly only know it's a city by the sea in southern Kenya. Is that worth checking out at all? 

If the time and money is right, I'd consider adding Rwanda to this too mainly because I'm very interested in the country's history and I've heard it's good for gorilla treks.

Kenya,Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,,kenya foreign aid

Kenya,Are Kenyans racist,"One issue that doesn’t get discussed enough is race and internalized biases in Kenya.

We often talk about tribalism, but what about how we treat people of different races? From the way we interact with white expats, to the treatment of Asians or even Black foreigners, are we unknowingly carrying forward colonial-era racial structures?

For example, why do some Kenyans associate wealth or authority with whitenessor how articulate one sounds? Why do certain racial groups seem to get preferential treatment in business or law enforcement? And on the flip side, are we unfairly hostile towards some communities because of historical grievances?

I’m not here to argue that Kenya is ""a racist country"" in the Western sense, but rather to spark an honest conversation: How much of our racial perceptions today are a colonial hangover? And what can we do to unlearn them?",https://v.redd.it/lq1gkycjvdre1,,kenya foreign aid

Kenya,Why ?,"There are some things I don’t understand about sub-Saharan African countries, especially places like Kenya. The JFK files were released today, and people are discussing a CIA base in Kenya—which is interesting, but not surprising.

When Kenya fails to condemn Israel for genocide, when British soldiers at BATUK assault and kill young women, when a CIA base is exposed in our country, there’s always one common excuse thrown around:

> ""bUT tTHey hElp uS fIghT tErrORIsm, gIvE us wEapOns, and tRaIN our sOLdiers.""



Fair enough. But I can’t help but ask—why?

Why, after 60 years of independence, do we still have to surrender chunks of our sovereignty? Because make no mistake—allowing foreign military bases and intelligence agents to operate freely within your country is a loss of sovereignty. The big powers would never allow this nonsense on their soil.

Why do we have to outsource something as basic as military training and intelligence? During Moi’s era, you couldn’t speak a word against Nyayo before the Special Branch was on your neck. Yet today, we supposedly need foreigners to fight terrorism? And who’s to say they even have our best interests at heart? The US isn’t Kenya, so we can’t pretend our strategic interests are fully aligned.

Building an independent and capable security apparatus isn’t some luxury—it’s a basic function of a state. That’s why every powerful country invested in its defense industry immediately after independence. But in Africa? The IMF and Western institutions convinced us that defense is secondary—a distraction from ""development.""

Meanwhile, in Ethiopia, the air force has developed a light aircraft. It’s a small step, but that’s how progress begins. Kenya, on the other hand? We’ll probably sell part of our sovereignty to the US in exchange for some outdated 1980s-era planes, roll them out during a national parade, and call ourselves a ""regional power."" But in 40 years, where will we be?

Beyond defense—why do we produce nothing?

The first BCG vaccine was developed 104 years ago.
The first polio vaccine came 70 years ago.
The first ARVs were made 38 years ago.

And yet, to this day, Kenya—a country of 50 million people—produces none of these. We still rely on foreign donations for essential vaccines. Why?

When the US jammed GPS signals on a Chinese ship in 2009, China immediately started building its own GPS system—no second warning needed. When India was still poor in 1966, it founded the Serum Institute, which is now the largest vaccine producer in the world.

Meanwhile, Kenya has a vaccine institute, and all I see from them is officials attending conferences. I have yet to see a single scientific paper from Kenya Biovax.

So I ask again—why?

And please, don’t give me the generic ""corruption and bad leadership"" excuse. India, China, and Brazil in the ‘60s weren’t corruption-free either. This is a deep, structural issue. It’s the same mentality that made our ancestors see Vasco da Gama’s guns and never think of making their own.

There’s something fundamentally broken in our societies, and I don’t know what it is. But we better start figuring it out—fast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jex4rq/why/,,kenya foreign aid
Kenya,"Kenya’s Foreign Policy: Weak, Directionless, and Powerless","The Margaret Nduta saga once again exposes Kenya’s weak foreign policy. In situations like this, countries usually leverage past diplomatic favors—hosting influential figures, providing aid, or supporting key UN resolutions—to negotiate better outcomes. But Kenya has none to cash in. Our foreign policy has long been defined by neutrality or blindly following the West, lacking any real independence. We can’t claim to be a regional power if all we do is issue generic statements about “peace” and “calling on both sides.”

Despite our history as a former settler colony that fought for independence through armed struggle (they called the Mau Mau terrorists, by the way), we still abstain from critical votes on Palestine. Compare that to South Africa’s stance. Meanwhile, Uganda projects power across the region—with troops in Somalia, the DRC, and even South Sudan to prevent conflict. They even provide security for the Equatorial Guinean president. And Kenya? We’re deploying police to Haiti while chaos brews in our own backyard. What exactly do we stand for? Because in geopolitics, if you stand for nothing, you get nowhere.

But let’s be real—you can’t have an independent foreign policy without military strength to back it up. Our air force still operates 1950s-era F-4 Phantoms. Just look at Sudan. If they, with their MiG-29s and Egyptian allies’ aerial refueling capabilities, decided to bomb Nairobi for hosting the RSF, what could we do besides wait for a UN condemnation? We need to step up. You can’t call yourself a regional power while Ethiopian raiders massacre 20 people inside your borders and even establish settlements.

Let’s get serious.

Kenya,Colonial Conservation: How the They Are Taking Our Land in the Name of Wildlife and Carbon Credits,"Some time ago, Prince William sparked outrage by blaming Africa’s population growth for the continent’s declining wildlife (just laugh at that). His remarks have been criticized as deeply hypocritical - how does a father of three (in UK) lecture African families about having too many children? Many have also pointed out that the UK has a far higher population density than any part of Africa, yet no one blames British families for environmental destruction.

Kenyan ecologist Dr. Mordecai Ogada, co-author of *The Big Conservation Lie*, challenges this narrative. He argues that Africa’s population is not the problem. Indigenous communities have coexisted with wildlife for centuries, relying on the land for survival rather than exploitation. It is the same flawed argument that claims African communities that have lived with wildlife for centuries are the real threat, while Westerners who have driven much of their own wildlife to extinction, have the answers.

This same logic is used to justify land grabs in the name of conservation. In January 2025, a Kenyan court ruled that two conservancies established by the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) in Isiolo County were unconstitutional due to a lack of community consent. The court ordered the removal of NRT rangers and revoked their licenses. This is yet to happen. This ruling exposed a long-standing issue of Western-backed organizations, often with ties to British royalty, controlling vast tracts of African land under the guise of protecting nature. 

Several conservancies in Kenya have direct British links, including Soysambu Conservancy near Lake Elmenteita, Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, and Lewa Downs—where Queen Elizabeth II was staying when she learned of her ascension to the throne. **NRT alone controls 6.37 million hectares, an area larger than all of Kenya’s national parks combined.** These conservancies operate like private fiefdoms, where locals are often displaced or heavily restricted from accessing their own ancestral lands.

The idea that African communities are the biggest threat to nature is just another colonial myth. It’s the same argument that was used to justify European land grabs during colonization, Africans are incapable of managing their own land and resources, so the West must step in. But history tells a different story. Africa’s wildlife crisis is not due to overpopulation but to centuries of foreign exploitation, land grabs, and the prioritization of Western interests over African lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jazcrd/colonial_conservation_how_the_they_are_taking_our/,,kenya foreign aid

Kenya,The Affordable Handshake: Will Ruto’s Dalliance with Baba Fade Before the Ink Dries?,"There is an african proveeb that says ""He who swallows a whole coconut must trust his anus."" 

Ruto has just swallowed the biggest political coconut of his life i.e shaking hands with Raila Odinga. And now, he must trust that his political stomach can digest it without embarrassing consequences. This is not just a handshake; it’s a full-course meal of survival politics, and Ruto knows that without Raila, his presidency risks serious indigestion.

Today’s handshake at State House wasn’t just a photo-op, it was Ruto and Raila signing their political death wish. And when the time comes, Gen Z, the undertaker, will conduct their final rites in August 2027.

Ruto, the self-proclaimed anti-dynasty warrior, has now tied his fate to Baba’s heartbeat. If, God forbid, Raila took an unscheduled trip to the ancestors tonight, Ruto would blow the entire 2025/26 national budget on witchdoctors, Silicon Valley AI, and importing foreign rogue pastors to try and resurrect him. And best believe, he’d out-mourn the Odinga familybwith his tears flooding the streets of Bondo while wearing the defeated look that Kimani Ichungwa had on Al Jazeera's Mehdi.

Forget the Finance Bill riots or Gen Z’s X Space rants—this would be the real crisis. Ruto, on his knees, wailing, “Hustlers, we need Baba back, or I’m finished!” Kenyan politics thrives on these dramatic alliances, and Ruto knows his Mount Kenya votes are already doing the Harlem Shake after Gachagua’s impeachment. Without Raila, he’s just a hustler with no dynasty to lean on.

Of course, Baba has been given billions, it’s become tradition at this point. But at 82, will he exhaust the billions before the sun sets on him? Will he have enough time to enjoy the spoils, or will nature cash its check before he does?

Another wise African Proverb says that a monkey that dances by the roadside must be prepared for stones.

For years, Ruto paraded himself as the anti-handshake champion, swearing he’d never share power with Raila. But today, the same Ruto is dancing by the roadside—and the stones are coming. The same Kenyans that roasted Uhuru for shaking Raila’s hand in 2018 is now polishing their slingshots, ready to fire at this new bromance. If Ruto thought Uhuru’s handshake was unpopular, wait till he sees what 2027 has in store.

Ruto has now invited Baba for tea faster than you can say ‘blood-based government.’ With ODM figures in Cabinet and Raila’s AUC bid flopped, Ruto’s presidency is basically a high-stakes chama where Baba is the treasurer holding all the cash 😂. If Raila checks out, Ruto’s left clutching a useless chequebook, out-crying the Odingas at the funeral, and begging the IMF for a loan to hire a time machine.

Meanwhile, Azimio diehards would scream deep state conspiracy, claiming Raila was taken out just to keep Kalonzo waiting forever.

Context is everything: Ruto’s been juggling a rebellious Mount Kenya, a sulky Uhuru, and a Gen Z movement ready to storm State House armed with Wi-Fi and vibes. Raila is his political oxygen mask—lose him, and he’s gasping in the thin air of 2027 re-election dreams. You’d see a state-sponsored sob-fest so dramatic, it’d make Mexican telenovelas jealous. The man might even pawn the Harambee House furniture to fund a “Resurrect Raila Taskforce” featuring NASA (the space agency, not the coalition) and a hotline to Wakanda.

This is peak Kenyan politics: one minute, you’re enemies; the next, you’re bromancing so hard that if one dips, the other is ready to bankrupt the nation and outweep the family, just to keep the show going.

Wait, was it a discounted dynasty alliance? Either way, Ruto just bought what he swore he’d never touch—at a price Kenya might soon start feeling.

Ruto’s not just shaking hands—he’s clutching on Raila like a lifeline. But will the lifeline hold until 2027, or will Gen Z deliver the final rites?

Kenya,Kenyan social media app ??,"This came to mind this morning in the shower so may just be nonsense but why don’t we have our own social media app, developed by us and for us. 

We seem to only be using foreign social media apps which is fine but I think as a people, especially given we are a tech hub or one of the tech hubs in Africa, we should at least have a social media app. 

I’m sure there are many skilled tech people in Kenya with enough dedication, bringing together of their resources (even if small) can create something that is our own online space. 

It could be so cool, and a great place for us as Kenyans to mobilise without foreign opinions, if we needed. 

I think our top tech wizards, need to get cracking to be honest. And it doesn’t even need to be as big as instagram or TikTok but just something for us Kenyans, and maybe other East Africans in the future?

✅ KES 160,000 (cash) on 18th September 2024, withdrawn together at MPESA agent till 090010, Citadel Cellular Comms, Thika Road Mall (MPESA transaction: SIO2OTZ561).

✅ KES 140,000 (cash) on 25th September 2024, handed over at Maziwa Heights Apartments.

✅ KES 5,000 (MPESA) on 23rd September 2024 (MPESA transaction: SINOL9TAJW).

✅ KES 43,000 (MPESA) on 14th September 2024, sent to Infinite Horizons Tours and Travel bank account (NCBA Pay Bill 880100) (MPESA transaction: SIE3JU80IN).

This totals KES 348,000, which he acknowledged verbally. However, when I followed up on the progress of my Foreigners’ ID application, he only acknowledged receiving KES 43,000 and denied receiving the remaining KES 305,000, despite clear evidence of these transactions.

Upon demanding a refund of at least KES 48,000 in alleged overcharges, he has failed to comply.

WARNING TO THE PUBLIC

If you are considering engaging Wakili Ombachi Brian Momanyi or Infinite Horizons Ltd, BEWARE. This is a clear case of fraud and misrepresentation. I am in the process of filing formal complaints with:
⚠️ Law Society of Kenya (LSK) – Seeking his disbarment.
⚠️ Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) – Reporting for fraud.
⚠️ Kenya Police (CID) – Filing for criminal prosecution.

If you have also been scammed by him, I encourage you to come forward and report him to the relevant authorities. Let’s hold fraudsters accountable and protect others from falling victim.

TO WAKILI OMBACHI BRIAN MOMANYI

You still have the opportunity to refund the full amount immediately before legal action escalates.

Kenya,Foreign policy under kasongo,"Kenya's diplomatic standing is taking hit after hit. This continent has fought too hard, for too long, to free itself from the grip of colonial powers, to stand on its own, to decide its own future. And yet in the middle of that struggle, must go's regime drags us backwards.

Look at the mess in Goma. The M23 crisis is a serious issue, one that needs African solutions. Instead, Must go brings in Macron, like someone incapable of reading the room. France, whose colonial grip on Africa is barely loosening, whose influence so many African nations are actively rejecting. Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, even Ivory Coast are kicking them out and here we are, inviting them in? That’s not leadership. That’s regression.

Then there’s the AU elections disaster. They show up with 100 MPs, making a scene, trying to strong-arm our way into a position we clearly hadn’t secured. And when Raila loses, some of the MPigs throw a fit, calling for Kenya to pull out of the AU? How do we claim to stand for African unity while acting like we’re above the very institutions meant to bring us together? This is the kind of arrogance that divides the continent, that weakens us.

And the worst of it, hosting the RSF at KICC. The same RSF that’s committing war crimes in Sudan, the same RSF that’s accused of ethnic cleansing, backed by foreign powers exploiting Africa’s conflicts. By giving them legitimacy, we’re not just tainting our name, we're signaling to the world that we’re willing to play host to warlords. What happened to Kenya’s moral high ground?

This isn’t just bad policy, it’s betrayal. History will not remember us kindly. Slowly, through bad decisions, alliances with the wrong people and short-sighted foreign policy.

Kenya,Controversial post,"I see so much by Kenyans recently ranting about so called passport bros and foreigners here. It seems to be mostly Kenyan men complaining about Kenyan women being interested in them.

I believe it’s more about the attitudes here towards women by Kenyan men that has caused it.

In Europe, it’s illegal to wolf whistle at a woman when she walks by, you can’t beat her, she has as much rights in the workplace as a man. It’s illegal to sexually exploit women at work just so she can get a job. Women are mostly respected in a relationship, and we work hard to bring home high incomes. 

If Kenyan men started treating their women better instead of seeing them as lesser than they are (generally speaking) maybe they would stop looking for love outside of Kenya. 

Fact is that in long term relationships we often provide a better quality of life, and it’s not just income. We respect women more. We know the importance of romance and let women be free to choose to be a housewife or career woman. Change your attitudes towards life and stop blaming others when it doesn’t go the way you want.

Nobody handed us the opportunities we have here, we had to prove that we deserved them as by Kenyan law a foreigner cannot be hired if a Kenyan can do the job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iqm6yt/controversial_post/,,kenya foreign aid
Kenya,It's time we are honest to ourselves about Kenya's standing on the continent,"I made a post earlier on what to do to increase our International standings because let's be honest, we are kidding ourselves those are two AUC elections we have lost, no country which claims to be a major player on the continent will lose two elections, Domestic politics aside, this shows how extremely weak we are in the continent and it's largely due to Kenya's lukewarm foreign policy, several cases come to mind  

A few years ago the Israeli ambassador was publicly kicked out of the AU meeting in Addis Ababa at the request of Algeria and South Africa, that was even before the war in Gaza broke out. When the war in Gaza broke out ,what did Kenya do? Release the usual BS statements of neutrality it always does and it's still doing 15 months later, it abstains in UN votes, even went ahead to condemn the Houthis and hasn't joined in any of the international actions including in the ICC and ICJ of which it is a member, needless to say this does not bode well with the North Africans.

DRC,  instead of taking a firm stance and calling out Rwanda's actions, Kenya is just releasing neutral statements that say nothing really in as many words. In S.Sudan with it's current government crisis, what has Kenya done? Again nothing...in Somalia when the government of Hassan Sheikh Mohammed (which Kenya recognises) had a dispute with Jubaland, Kenya responded with the same usual BS statements, I mean. Then there are the abductions of the Turkish exiles and Kizza Besigye ,such behaviours really affect a country's prestige.

If you want to be a regional and continental player, you have to start acting like one and you don't do that while sitting on the fence and you must be prepared to walk the talk ,South Africa isn't afraid to call out Israel for example is because they don't rely on it for it's security and defense industry, it has already developed a very robust one ,indeed it's the only African country that sells arms to the Americans. Kenya had to go against it's principles in order to secure Turkish drones (by deporting the Turks), needless to say if we made our own drones  we wouldn't have to do that. In short you don't become a key player in international politics if you don't have the capability to say F**k U, and that's what we should work towards or abandon all hopes of becoming any international player.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iq40e3/its_time_we_are_honest_to_ourselves_about_kenyas/,,kenya foreign aid
Kenya,Unpopular opinion,"Kenya will never be a regional or continental player if all we do is take neutral stances on everything and release lukewarm statements on happenings in the continent and region. Kenya of course does this to avoid bearing any cost, but you can't be any power geopolitically if you aren't willing to spend , you must be willing to spend heavily on your military, diplomatic missions ,intelligence services, infrastructure (that would enable you to host various summits)  and outreach programmes e.g sending doctors, relief aid, teachers etc to conflict and distressed areas ,eg Kenya should be having a fully functioning hospital (level 4 type) in DRC and Sudan (on your own dime).

For us to be able to afford this we have to have a robust economy,  you don't become a regional power with an economy of 120 bn usd just because your neighbours have 50 bn usd economies...I mean you are ahead but still crap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iq0aar/unpopular_opinion/,,kenya foreign aid

Kenya,Trump/ The Republicans are not guessing he is implementing Project 2025,"Project 2025 is a political plan developed by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in the United States, to prepare for a potential Republican administration in 2025. 

It is essentially a blueprint for how a new conservative president could reshape the U.S. government.  

The plan focuses on four main pillars:  

1. Policy Agenda – It outlines conservative policies for major government agencies, including reducing government regulations, cutting welfare programs, and increasing executive power. 

2. Personnel – It aims to recruit and train conservative individuals to fill key government positions, ensuring the administration aligns with their ideology.  

3. Training Academy – It includes an online education program to train appointees on how to implement conservative governance.  

4. Transition Plans – It provides a detailed strategy to quickly implement these policies as soon as a Republican president takes office.  

For Kenya, Project 2025 might is  relevant in terms of U.S. foreign policy, as it proposes changes to how America engages with international organizations, aid programs, and global trade.

Kenya,GPT Roasts Kenya,"I asked GPT to roast Kenya. It is very accurate. 

1. Kenya Power – The Ultimate Villain

KPLC doesn’t discriminate—rich, poor, middle class, if they decide you don’t need electricity, you don’t need electricity. It’s like they hold national meetings just to decide which town gets plunged into darkness next.

2. Safari? More Like Suffer-i

Kenya is known worldwide for safaris, but let’s be honest—unless you’re a tourist paying in dollars, that experience is for the mzunga na matajiri (foreigners and the rich). Locals get to see a warthog on Mombasa Road and call it a day.

3. ""We Shall Fix This Economy!""

Every election season, politicians come with fresh promises to fix the economy. Fast forward a few months, and suddenly, the only thing getting fixed is their bank accounts.

4. Road Construction—A Lifetime Project

A road that started in 2010 is still ""under construction"" in 2025. Meanwhile, the Chinese built a whole railway in 3 years. Priorities?

5. Hustlers vs. Dynasties

Kenyan politics is just a soap opera starring two families that have been in power since independence. Every five years, they pretend to be fighting, but after elections, they're all eating nyama choma together.

6. Nairobi Rent – A Crime Scene

How is rent in Nairobi so high? Landlords act like their single-room apartments come with Wi-Fi, gold-plated taps, and an expressway to heaven.

7. The National Anthem of Nairobi – “Hustle!”

From the shoe shiner to the Uber driver, to the guy selling power banks at the roundabout—everybody in Nairobi is on a grind. Sleep? That's a luxury only the government enjoys.

8. Bank Loans – Quick to Take, Impossible to Repay

A Kenyan bank will approve your loan in minutes but if you miss a single payment, your name will be in CRB faster than you can say ""nilikuwa na shida kidogo.""

9. Government Offices – A Masterclass in Patience

Need an ID, passport, or birth certificate? Get ready for a 3-month pilgrimage. Huduma Namba was supposed to fix things, but at this point, we might get to Mars before the system works.

10. Kenyans & Tribalism – United Online, Divided at Elections

Overall, I think it did a decent job of providing an overview of African growth and development, with implications both for business and policy. However, I wish it spoke more to trade (both within and beyond the continent). And I wish it also had an article on differences between various countries in Africa.

Why is it that literally anyone can enter Kenya and obtain an ID/birth certificate as long as they 'pay something'?

But over the years, personal and geopolitical events have pushed me to examine spirituality through theological, logical, and historical lenses. I turn 22 this year and now I’m an atheist. This quote resonates with me in a way I never imagined it could.

**The DRC**

In Goma, a church was bombed less than a week ago. Yet, it barely made a blip in international media. The tragedy was just another drop in the ocean of atrocities. A Congolese national on TikTok shared a video of his team delivering aid when a bomb landed just meters away. You can hear the gunshots in the background as they scrambled for safety. In the same video, a woman and her young child calmly narrate the bombing like it’s just another day. Children are trafficked and enslaved to mine the cobalt and coltan that power our smartphones and electric cars. They die in suffocating pits, crushed under collapsing earth. The ones who survive often endure daily abuse, starvation, and diseases no child should ever face. I could give you the statistics but we have been desensitized so that occurrence was the grunge reality of those on the ground. Ponder on it. Then go amplify [Pappy Orion TikTok's page](https://www.tiktok.com/@pappyorion) as he shares with the world the grim reality of those on the ground.

**Palestine**

The following are videos I've seen with my own eyes: A child sits in the rubble of their destroyed home, shaking uncontrollably, panicking, frantically looking for a place to hide as planes pass overhead. A man holds up a half-mutilated body of a child, missing parts from the torso down and flesh hanging off the place of severance. A father, holding the birth certificates of his newborn twins, weeps uncontrollably. They were killed in an airstrike while he was out running errands. A boy stares into the distance with a blank, emotionless face; his entire family is gone. How do you console a child whose world was obliterated in seconds? How do you justify children dying from heart attacks because they’re so paralyzed with fear? [The story of 5 year old Hind Rajab is just devastating](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i9099v/the_story_of_hind_rajab/). But instead of universal outrage, we hear excuses. *""Shouldn’t have started a war you can’t win,""* they say. As if that justifies killing children. As if those children were combatants instead of victims. And to those claiming *""It started on October 7th,""* where were you when children were being humiliated, harassed, and terrorized by idf soldiers years before? This isn’t about land anymore. It’s about the inhumanity of it all. And if your reaction is to pick a side instead of mourning the dead, I don’t know what to tell you.

**Sudan**

The UAE has provided funding, logistics, and military equipment under the guise of securing its economic interests. Reports show that weapons and ammunition have been covertly supplied to the RSF, even as UAE denies involvement. Humanitarian aid shipments have been revealed as covers for arms transfers, and recent investigations by US lawmakers confirmed ongoing support from the UAE despite its official denials. Now over 10.2 million people displaced. More than 750,000 people on the brink of starvation. Entire communities wiped out as the RSF slaughters civilians with impunity, committing acts of genocide that shock even those hardened by years of conflict. Families, already living in desperate conditions, are left with no choice but to flee. Refugee camps swell with starving, sick, and traumatized survivors who may never see justice.

**Unequal Attention**

What breaks me most is how unequal the coverage is. It was easier to find the details of Palestinian atrocities than it was for Sudanese or Congolese ones. And I say this as an African. My own people, my brothers and sisters, are so overlooked that their suffering isn’t even documented properly. The media relegates African atrocities to footnotes, treating them as less significant than others. The world cries for Ukraine or Gaza, and they should, but where are those same voices for Sudan and the DRC? The silence is deafening.

**Theological Reflection**

I’m sick of hearing people try to explain this away. Whether in the DRC, Sudan or Gaza, the suffering is not part of some mysterious, divine plan. If God exists and allows this, He isn’t good. If He wants to stop it but can’t, He isn’t powerful. Claiming He’s all-loving in the face of these horrors is an insult to every victim’s memory. Spare me the debates about free will or 'God works in mysterious ways.' There is no justification for this. No excuse for letting innocent children suffer, for letting entire families and communities be destroyed. If your God loves you, fine. But don’t call Him all-loving, because His actions (and lack thereof) don't reflect that.

**Historical Atrocities in the Name of God**

This isn’t a modern problem. Religion has justified horrors for centuries. The Crusades left rivers of blood in their wake. Colonialism destroyed entire continents. In Africa, missionaries came with Bibles in hand, preaching salvation while stealing land and stripping people of their culture. In the Americas, conquistadors slaughtered Indigenous people in the name of Christ. One Native American chief, before being executed by the Spanish, said, *""I do not want to go to heaven if that’s where the Spanish are.""* Can you blame him? Heaven was a place for the colonizers; a paradise for murderers who brought nothing but death and destruction. If that’s God’s plan, I want no part of it",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i926d9/if_god_is_allpowerful_he_cannot_be_allgood_and_if/,,kenya foreign aid

Kenya,A Dramatic Journey from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam ( My encounter with Tanzanian highway police at night),"I had always had a keen interest in traveling to Tanzania (especially it's largest city Dar). I have a keen interest on living minimally and backpacking all over the world.

 Tanzania was my tester, so an opportunity came when I connected with my campus buddy who had film projects there and was living in Dar. He invited me and since I was working online at the time,I took the opportunity. I went to river road and booked a bus, I was in a hurry,  so when I was told Tahmeed busses were full for the next day, I insisted on looking for another company (I was desperate to go) river road being river road some guy at the Tahmeed booking office connected me to another guy. This guy went with me in some streets and we found another bus company (Trinity company) I hurriedly booked the ticket. 

The guy told me I call him before I came in the morning.  So morning came, nikafika tao ma 5am. Maze kucall uyo guy,alicome yes,bana kumbe that company haiendangi Dar alikuwa ananiuza kwa company ingine,I think ya tourist wanatoka Jiji hadi Arusha, I  remember I sat with a pregnant Burundian woman ( lafudhi yake ya kiswahili ilikuwa funny) she complained alot about her expirience at the boder while entering kenya from Uganda.

 That morning before Nitoke  kejani,nilikuwa nimevuruta Wajakoya ndio ni meditate kwa io journey.So the woman talking nilikuwa tu na medi akifikiri namskiza. We reached Namanga and it was all smooth. Maze kufika Arusha it was  the end of the journey ya io basi and tuli have kuuzwa kwa ingine. Now the second bus nilipandishwa ilikuwa zile buses  kama Mbukinya but ya uko sasa.The Nairobi guy took like 5k from me najua alikula cut big, ningepandishwa tu a decent bus from Arusha to Dar. 

Night came and we started the journey.  The bus was full A.F. Na io journey ni mbali msee like mbaali bana. Guys sat even chini bana. It was this coster buses that come from China ,kama daladala zao, my seat was apo kwa malango where the makanga seats like neighbour ya io seat. Ma giz giz tunaenda hatufiki, since jaba is illegal uko, dere na makanga walikuwa wanatema taxin kwa paper ma njege wakiwa on sight then wanarudisha tukiendelea. 
Just past Moshi, we were stopped  by police for the second time,Dere aka arifu makanga ateme ""mirungi"" as they call jaba there. I was kinda sleepy but vile nilisikia dere  akiwarn makanga nika amka. A police officer in white uniform like the Salvàion Army church members entered the bus . He looked around, na I think since mimi ndio nilikiwa nimevaa mavin solo nikasikia "" wewe,njoo nje"" , You know I was like Tf inside my mind.. the police continued by saying "" chukua begi lako pia"" I had my laptop bag on my laps. So I followed the cop. We went behind the bus. Some cop akanimulika kwa uso kiutiaji kama kawaida ya macop ma  ufala tu,you know them..

 Then he said shouted in kiswahili  , "" afande uyu si MTanzania"" ule mwingine alikuwa kwa gari akasema "" kama hana stakabadhi ,piga simu!!""  by now, around three cops were around me, the one questioning me asked, ""unastabadhi?"" I said ndio, I opened my bag and one of the cops took my bag as the other one was provided light with their torch.

Kenya,Incubators- The Infamous Startup Support Racket,"Anyone else notice there’s a whole swarm of these *“training-first, funding-maybe”* programs targeting African startups? Especially here in Kenya?

Every other year, there’s some new incubator or accelerator dropping flashy ads promising mentorship, exposure, networking, “access to capital”... the usual dream.

But then you visit their website — and the first thing you see is a price tag.

>KES 15,000 to attend our Founders Bootcamp

Bro? Excuse me?? You want founders — the people already broke, already hustling, already building — to *pay you* to teach them how to be founders?

Make it make sense.  
They’re literally selling *the idea* of being a founder back to the people who are already doing it. 😭

It’s like walking into a hospital with a bleeding arm and they say, *“Sure, but first, pay for this course on how to be a better patient.”*

These programs are out here monetizing the grind.  
Not funding founders — they're farming us.

If your “incubator” makes its money by charging struggling entrepreneurs for workshops, training, and a shot at “maybe funding”… you’re a scam.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l7367k/incubators_the_infamous_startup_support_racket/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,I don't know how to title this ...,"I don't know if I've tittle this correctly but ...., I'll just write sometimes all you have is pen and paper and in my case a laptop ,Wi-Fi and reddit will do , lol.

I'm in my mid thirties for context. 2 years ago I embarked on a journey to create employment not only for myself but possibly for the people around me in my community and globally. A girl can dream right. My thought process was we consume a lot from the western world and all other areas of the globe but what do they consume from us directly? They have platforms and avenues where they can sell arts crafts and all kinds of creations straight from their backyards or garages and make really good money and sustain their livelihoods'. I was like you know what, we have all these hand crafted stuff that they pay top dollars for why cant we create platforms or channels  where our local artisans especially east Africans can market and sell their artifacts to the world and make their money ? 

I also had an idea to build a digital product one that defies borders, wipes them out completely and turns the world into a true global village, put real connections right at our fingertips. Just Imagine the infinite doors this could open mixing cultures blending Ideas people from totally different worlds working together with the possibility of creating honest income. A girl can dream. besides mobile money transfer originated from Africa, Kenya to be precise.

One thing about it that's not two, dreams need actions to actualize, to actualize one needs resources.  Resources can be monetary but in my journey I've come to realize resource is a heavy packed word. A roof over your head , a meal , health care , moral mental ,emotional support all are vital resources when it comes to building on as well as actualizing our dreams. For the past one year I've been running on fumes. last week Monday had to give up all my possessions for auction, the last thing I have to my name is my laptop. by end of day today I will be homeless as my landlady gave me notice to vacate .

I tried setting up a go fund me ... funny story the hoops and loops one has to go through smh. 

I tried UFANDAO guess what they expect you to give first to receive and you know what you cant donate to African causes literally. when you try you find you're blocked from donating to any African causes 

And then there's PayPal that treats receiving money in Africa like a conduit to funding terror groups or money laundering. Try creating [Paypal.me](http://Paypal.me) let me know how it goes if you're in Africa.

There's a chihuahua somewhere on these fundraiser platforms that's probably garnered over 10 thousand USD in donations while I have to pay for my fundraiser to go live ... diabolical. I don't have it but I somehow have to have it to get help I need to have it ? I'm confused lol. 

My mental health is probably in the dumpster somewhere, but lets assume that for now, if I ignore it long enough it probably wont exist.  

What am I saying ? dear Africa we have the capacity resources brains skilled labor  and everything else in-between to create a self sufficient continent. we let the western world take soo much from us while they give literally nothing back but religion and a dream that our riches are in heaven while actively enjoying our tangible resources to make their lives easier and better.

Kenya,Anyone here using Alibaba to import goods into Kenya?,"Many Kenyans are turning to Alibaba to source products cheaply from China — things like electronics, clothes, kitchenware, and more. Whether for resale or personal use, the platform offers lower prices than local markets. But importing is not as easy as checking out online.

**Shipping:** You can choose air freight (fast but expensive), sea freight (cheaper but takes 30–40 days), or courier services like DHL (fast but very costly). Sea freight is more economical for bulk orders, but it needs patience and paperwork.

**Payments:** Alibaba offers Trade Assurance (like an escrow), which protects buyers until goods arrive. Alipay is another option, and recently, M-PESA started working with Alipay — which is a game-changer for small Kenyan buyers. Still, some suppliers prefer bank transfers, which feels risky for first-timers.

**Customs:** This part can be tricky. KRA charges VAT and import duties depending on what you’re bringing in. Some people have had shipments held because of unclear paperwork or surprise fees. Freight forwarders can help, but they also charge their cut.

Then there are risks: fake suppliers, poor-quality items, delays, and no recourse if you didn’t use Trade Assurance. Some people say it's worth it, others have horror stories.

So I’m curious — has anyone here successfully used Alibaba to import to Kenya? What were the challenges or wins? Any tips for shipping, payments, or avoiding scams?

Kenya,Parent that has the financial ability but isn't being supportive...,"I've been raised as the only son. My dad actually has a good position in a very good company here in kenya. We even get free medical cover because of him being a staff in that company. He was employed when he was 19 years and he then went for higher learning and grew through the ranks until where he is today. 

When I was back home in a city in kenya, I wont mention, my neighbours used to think that I'm a rich man's son, and that I was pampered and all that. The truth is the only things I got from my dad were simple things. I can't even name a shoe or a clothe that he ever bought for me or anything. If I passed my exam, I was just told it's ok. Nothing happens. 

My dad just cared about paying school fees and anything that relates to it. Those other things, no. I remember there was a time when I was in std 6, he completely refused to buy me shoes. I was walking with completely torn up shoes. The shoes looked like they could talk to your friend and ruin his entire day. 

That day, I got so angry and I did the unspeakable. I took cement from the store and poured in his well polished shoes and went to school. I was never the troublesome kid. I was just that kid who was calm, passed exams and loved cartoons. I was like a role model to some kids. I was always the 'nice' kid.  I just did that out of anger. The kids of the father's who worked with my dad seemed to live good lives as compared to my pathetic life.

My dad actually owns a business, land, and rentals in two cities. The rest I don't know. He is also a drunkard. From when I was young I just avoided borrowing him money because he would never give me. I used to just borrow my mom and when she doesn't have, then I just understood because she has a small business. My dad is much superior to her financially.

We also don't pay rent because we live in my dad's property. Now, let me go to my main topic. I studied smart and ended up completing my degree. So I became one of the unemployed youths for sometime. Within a month I got a casual job. The casual job was a continuous one, 24/7 but I used to work at night.

So I was to stay alert at night and sleep during the day. The job paid averagely and I can't complain. It wasn't a hard job too. So it came to an end in December. From then, I was unemployed. I was doing every kind of gig and every kind of thing just not to go home. I reached a point where I was capable of illegal activities like fraud but I didn't do them. I fear DCI. By that time, I'd sometimes tell my dad nimelemewa but the old man just wanted me to go home.

I'd tell him that, and I'd have to disturb him for days only for him to send 150 kes. I just knew I was a partial orphan. So last month but 1, I told him I'd go back home because I had suffered enough. My friends told me to continue pushing and that some day things might get better. What gave me hope was the interviews I got. I used to walk to those interviews because I had no money. I mean long distance journeys.

There was a time I was very sick. I told my old man and he just told me to go to the hospital. I had no money and he didn't send any. I just told my mom and she sent 300 kes and told me to use it as transport and in case of anything I should call her. My dad went ghost mode and called me after a week, only to send me 500 kes. He just asked if I'm ok and I said no and that's what he did.

Today, what broke my heart was how he responded to my call. I'm his only son so I really don't know why he just acts like I'm not human or what. I got a job on Tuesday. A casual one. But, the fare is 80 kes. I mean 80 kes in the evening and 80 kes in the morning. I work at night.

I just called him since I know it's that time that they've already been paid. I told him to only send me fare to go to work today. I also told him that I had not paid last month's rent and the landlord is on my neck. You know what he said? I know you've already guessed right. 

He was like, "" 'James' (not my real name) hebu omba mama yako. Mimi sina pesa kabisaa"". Then I told him that I had borrowed my mom countless times. I have even taken loans from my friends and even the banks, and fuliza but he just said, ""mimi sina pesa. Kopa mama yako alafu umwambie utamlipa"". I just heard that and cut the phone. 

You can also imagine that he has blocked me in all his numbers except one. If he blocks that one number then I'll never be able to contact him again.

I'm just feeling so low. When will life go my way. I don't remember a day that I had a decent meal. You can also imagine I'm a casual worker and it's not that easy when you're not eating well. I'm so tired and maybe I was just born into the wrong family. I just wish I can get that fare before evening because not going to work is also depressing.

I swear I'll never let my children experience this. I'll support them till they get financially stable. I'll do that shamelessly. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0h5jg/parent_that_has_the_financial_ability_but_isnt/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,Give your sons inheritance.,"
I’m a misogynist because of my mum. It’s from her that I learnt phrases like 🚨 “a woman is not your friend”, “make money because women disrespect men without money ”, “kazi yako ndio mke wako wa kwanza.”
 
She also gave me my first two acres 💰 even without asking. What made the whole thing special 💐 was that she had inherited the land from her mum and she directly gave me the same land—something many African/Luhya women would never do.

She of course took me to private schools 🏫 both primary and university to ensure that I get the best. She ensured that when I was applying for my passport that I’d get it fast 💨 so that I could travel 🧳 easily. She is the reason I have very high standards.

My 🤩 mum empowered me because she is a woman and she knows what women are capable of.
She understood that it’s only with such moves that she’d ensure my financial stability as well as freedom from both my sisters and any other woman 👩‍🦱.

Here is to the mums in this group: empower your sons—after all, you know what your fellow women can do and you have examples of that. 

And kudos to my 🫡 mum for setting up the bar.

Edit: this post is sarcastic and from the looks of it it went over many peoples head. why do we need to have gender wars based on other people actions yes there are bad men and women out here but there are also good men and women just choose wisely, respect yourself and have boundaries, if somebody crosses be ready to cut them off .

Kenya,Alleged Abduction of Kenyan MP George Koimburi Amid Political Tensions,"On 25 May 2025, George Koimburi, Member of Parliament for Juja, was allegedly abducted outside the Full Gospel Church in Mugutha, Kiambu County, Kenya, by unidentified individuals and was found the following day, injured and unconscious, at a coffee plantation in Ruiru, approximately 10 kilometres away. He is currently receiving medical treatment at Karen Hospital in Nairobi.   
  
The National Police Service (NPS) is investigating the incident but denies involvement, asserting that Koimburi was under investigation for alleged land fraud and misuse of Constituency Development Funds, having evaded arrest on 23 May. The NPS also suggests Koimburi may have staged his abduction, though investigations continue to establish the facts. Koimburi, a vocal critic of President William Ruto and an ally of former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, was previously arrested in February 2025 for allegedly forging academic qualifications, a charge he denies.  
  
Opposition leaders, including Kalonzo Musyoka, condemned the abduction and expressed concerns about the safety of public officials, highlighting broader issues of political harassment. This incident follows a reported wave of over 80 abductions in Kenya since June 2024, which the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights attributes to state security agencies, though the government denies involvement.

I'm not the type to chase someone if they're breaking up with me. I don't ask a million questions and cry for a second chance.

If this is how the first time I ask a guy out turns out, I will NEVAAH do such a thing again. Eh, but I loved him😭 I even bought us matching outfits😭 I must burn them. I gave him my favourite panties. I want them back😭

But on a serious note, being told by someone you love that they only have lust for you cuts deep. Cause all my feelings were genuine on my side.

Kenya,UON Conned,"ICYMI..

EXCLUSIVE: How an Impostor Brought Kenya’s Premier University to Its Knees
The Curious Case of Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo – The Man Who Staged a Real-Life Thriller at the University of Nairobi
By Investigative Desk
 
If you thought Joshua Waiganjo—the man who posed as a senior police officer—was Kenya’s greatest impostor, think again. A new king of deception has emerged, and his theatre was not a remote police post, but the highest citadel of intellectualism in Kenya: the University of Nairobi (UoN). Meet Brian Daniel Ouma Okeyo—a man whose mastery of lies, manipulation, and coercion reads like a Hollywood political thriller. From masquerading as a Catholic priest, senior intelligent [couldn't pronounce it well-how he'd scare people with!] officer to an international fund raiser!
This week, Ouma was finally unmasked and arraigned in court, facing charges of abuse of office, academic fraud, and the unlawful acquisition of over KES 32 million from public coffers. His arrest by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alongside senior Council members of UoN sent shockwaves across Kenya’s academic and governance sectors.
But who is Brian Ouma?
He was once a driver—yes, a driver—assigned to Chancellor Dr Vijoo Rattansi. He swindle d peopke by posing as Rattansi's PA cum bodyguard.But from those humble beginnings, Ouma’s ambitions knew no bounds. He is alleged to have forged academic documents, including an MBA certificate from a reputable university, and used them to armtwist top university official to secure top-level positions at UoN. It is only Prof. Magoha who doubted Ouma's papers and denied him a job. Prof. Magoha saw no peace as Education Cabinet Secretary until he was shiwn the door. Ouma is rumoured to have swore that Prof Magoha would never find peace, and true to hus word, Prof Magoha's attempt to become an Emeritus Professor at UoN were thwarted by Ouma! To ascend to what he referred as the 'table', Ouma manipulated University Council processes to rewrite governance structures, and eventually self-styled himself as The Chief Operations Officer (COO)—a role he created and appointed himself to. The university statutes do not have this position.
Insiders say he was so brazen that he drafted proposals to restructure the university’s governance system to weaken the Vice-Chancellor’s role and centralise all power under the COO—himself. His argument was thst a Vice-Chancellor need not be a Professor as their preview is in classrooms. At one point, he even plotted to become the Vice-Chancellor without holding a single recognised academic qualification. He would bypass the Ministry of Education, dismiss the role of the Cabinet Secretary as “cosmetic,” and advised the Council to unilaterally install his preferred Vice Chancellor!
Worse still, he allegedly  named in a scandal where he influenced the admission of unqualified students into the competitive Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Paediatrics programmes without merit. What began as fraud escalated into what could be considered educational sabotage. If true, this borders on criminal negligence—entrusting human lives to unqualified medics.
But that was not all.
Brian turned the university into his private estate. He sidelined directors, installed cronies, intimidated staff, and reportedly ran a parallel government within the institution. He filed dozens of court cases, paralysing UoN's operations and reforms. Over 400 cases are linked to his faction, turning the judiciary into his preferred tool of resistance.
He then ventured into tenderpreneurship, allegedly looting endowment funds meant for student scholarships and research. He broke deals over UoN land and dished out contracts like political favours.Any line officer who dared question his underhand deals would regret dearly. The infamous transfers of senior officers by the Council Chairman was as a result of the bad blood occasioned by Brian.Sources claim that Council members received “tokens of appreciation” to keep him in power. Council members who wouldn't toll the line are forced to resign or their appointments revoked.Through a network of enablers, he destroyed the careers of five Vice-Chancellors—Prof. Mbithi, Prof. Mbeche, Prof. Ogot, Prof. Ogeng’o, and Prof. Kiama—as well as countless administrators and technical staff who dared question his authority. The current hullabaloo at UoN is as a result of the current Vice-Chancellor refusing to give in to Ouma's demands.
The result? A once world-class university now faces over KES 13 billion in pending bills, crumbling infrastructure, and a deeply demoralised workforce. His reign pushed UoN into conflict with government, compromised its national reputation, and reversed decades of academic progress.
Brian Ouma is no ordinary impostor. He has an insatiable appetite for power. He did not stop at impersonation; he reimagined and rewrote the very fabric of governance at Kenya’s most iconic university—unchecked and unchallenged, until now.
As he now stands before the courts, Kenyans are left asking: How could the intellectual powerhouse of East Africa fall for such a man? And how many more “Brians” are hiding in our institutions?
For now, justice may finally be catching up with the man who made deception a job description. But the damage he has inflicted on UoN—and on public trust—may take years to undo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1krq5qu/uon_conned/,,usaid kenya funding cut
Kenya,Some reality check you might need...,"Marriage Isn’t a Love Story—It’s a Survival Test

Let’s destroy the fantasy:

Marriage isn’t magic. It’s maintenance.

There’s no Disney soundtrack. No soft fade into bliss. No credits rolling with smiles and sunset.

Marriage is a contract—with moving deadlines, unpaid invoices, and emotional overdrafts.

You don’t marry peace. You marry problems you’re willing to solve—forever.

Let’s talk real:

—

1. Two Become One? No—Two Collide Loudly

You’re a lion. She’s a swan. You want silence. She wants connection.

You thought merging identities was cute?

Wait till you realize she doesn’t rinse the blender after use. She leaves hair in the sink. She plays voice notes out loud at 6:30am.

This isn’t unity—it’s adjusted warfare.

And every day is a compromise.

Not a kiss.

—

2. There’s No Such Thing as “Financially Ready”

Waiting to be “stable” before marriage?

You’ll wait forever.

Even billionaires have bad quarters. Even CEOs face layoffs. Even trust fund babies have alimony battles.

The moment you marry, life hits: Hospital bills. Car repairs. Leaky roofs. Kid's braces.

The illusion of financial “readiness” is a trick to stall responsibility.

Money doesn’t protect marriage.

Discipline does.

—

3. In-Laws Are a Full-Time Obstacle Course

Her mom wants a say in your bedroom.

Her dad still thinks you’re not good enough.

Her sister hates you on principle.

And your own mother still wants you to “come home more often.”

Marriage isn’t two people.

It’s two tribes, two traumas, and two group chats you’ll want to leave every week.

Love her?

Get ready to survive her ecosystem.

—

4. Pregnancy Is a Bomb With a Beautiful Aftermath

No sleep. No sex. No peace. No schedule.

Her hormones are on a rollercoaster. Her back is screaming. Her moods shift like weather.

And you?

You’re expected to stay calm, supportive, rich, and romantic.

Pregnancy doesn’t just change her body. It rewires your entire life.

And if you're not emotionally grounded?

You’ll break while she’s blooming.

—

5. Even When It Works, You Still Get Children—A.K.A. Permanent Roommates That Scream

They don’t care about your meetings. They don’t care about your peace. They don’t care that you paid the rent.

They wake you up. Throw up on your suit. Ruin your dates. Hijack your bank account.

Kids are cute chaos.

And the “blessing” comes with at least 18 years of emotional financing.

—

6. “Forever” Is a Long Time to Share a Bathroom

You think you know her?

Wait 7 years.

Her interests shift. Her body changes. Her politics evolve. Her libido... retires early.

Marriage requires constant re-introductions.

Who she was at 27 will not be who she is at 37.

And if you’re not willing to love a thousand versions of the same person?

You’re not ready.

—

7. You’ll Forgive More Than You Ever Imagined—Or You’ll Break

She’ll say things that cut. She’ll do things that confuse. She’ll hurt you deeply—and still expect dinner.

And you?

You’ll have to swallow your ego, revisit your boundaries, and choose peace over pride more times than you thought possible.

Marriage is forgiveness on repeat.

And sometimes?

The hardest thing to heal... is loving someone who broke you.

—

8. Marriage Is a Business—One Lazy Partner Will Bankrupt the Whole Thing

It takes two investors to grow it.

But one reckless decision—one emotional tantrum, one cheating moment, one lazy stretch—and it’s over.

Marriage demands ROI: Time. Energy. Sacrifice. Forgiveness. Vision.

And if one partner’s asleep at the wheel?

You both crash.

—

Final Word: Everything Ends—In Death or Divorce. Prepare for Impact.

Don’t walk into marriage with cinema dreams and Instagram logic.

Walk in with clarity. Grit. Adaptability. Because this isn’t a fairy tale. It’s a fight.

And love doesn’t conquer all.

Sometimes?

Love dies quietly—in resentment, in routine, in unreconciled truths.

So brace yourself.

This isn’t “happily ever after.”

This is “grind together until the end—or fall apart trying.”

They had this 70-year-old motivational speaker come through, and bro was spitting advice like we’re still stuck in the 20th century. 😭 I’m sitting there like, bruh, what is this?

First off, this dude had the audacity to tell students they shouldn’t even “touch” a phone at home during holidays or on visiting days at school. Like, excuse me? You’re telling my kid they can’t have a chatwith their siblings who couldn’t make it to see her? In 2025, when phones are basically our lifeline? That’s wild. Phones aren’t just for vibes; they’re how we stay connected.

Then, he drops this outdated gem: “Education is the *only* way to succeed.” Nah, fam, I would’ve stood up and asked, “Sir, you know how many Gen Zs are out here pushing Lambos and Teslas in their 20s, with no degree, and their net worth is clowning yours?” Like, let’s talk about the content creators, coders, and entrepreneurs who dropped out, leveled up their skills, and are now global. This man was flexing his 6-bedroom mansion like it’s the ultimate glow-up, and I’m like, *dawg, that’s cute, but Gen Zs are buying penthouses and crypto.* Oh, and he also bragged about traveling to *three* African countries. 😅 Meanwhile, we got 22-year-olds who’ve been to Dubai, the US, and Europe, funding it all with their hustle—no degree required.

Here’s the tea: skills > papers. The world’s moving fast, and these Gen X speakers are out of touch. They don’t get that our phones are our office, our studio, our *employer*. We’re out here building brands on TikTok, coding apps, and closing deals on X, while they’re still preaching “go to school, get a job.” Nah, we need millennials or Gen Zs to speak at these events people who actually get the game. Stop inviting folks who think a landline is cutting-edge to guide our generation. We’re not tryna hear it. #SkillsNotScripts

Kenya,CRYBABY PARENTS SHIT THEIR PANTS AS CBC INC,"# Once you're done reading these posts, please guys, do answer said questions

# Do you agree CBC is the way forward?

# Are teachers the real bottleneck/issues? I think so

# How do we fix an education system where even the educators don’t know how to learn and are teaching kids garbage?

# And to the parents reading this: are you supporting your child’s growth, or just projecting your own academic trauma?

Anyway, now that I got your attention with the headline and the post, hold on before you smash that downvote or scroll past thinking this is just another rant. Hear me out first, ok? This post is about cutting through the noise and calling out uncomfortable truths nobody else dares to say loud because they'll be stoned to death. It’s not clickbait fluff or empty hot takes. If you want the facts and not bs then stay right here, piga upvote and open your eyes. If not, go ahead and keep sipping that ignorance tea while the rest of us move forward.

Let’s talk fellow Kenyans. Because I’m tired of the noise.

Everyone’s has been up in arms lately about CBC. Parents calling it “too much work,” teachers saying “we weren’t trained for this,” and some students whining about “too many projects.”. I'm gonna drop a bombshell none of you expected, today. In my humble opinion, most of these complaints aren’t about CBC being broken. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. STAY WITH ME HERE.

Rather, they’re about people being too deep-rooted in the outdated, compliance-based, brain-numbing mess that was 8-4-4. Now personally, I have never done 8-4-4, but some issues are obvious

I’ve been in education for over 20 years and counting. That’s not a typo.  
— 11 years of primary, junior high, and high school (Y1–Y11 equivalent)  
— 2 years of IAL  
— 6+ years of university for medicine  
— Then residency and specialization (cardiology? another 6 years minimum)

Ok, now that I've established where I lie, and show I am neutral and have no bias. Let me go on;

You want to know the truth? **CBC isn’t hard**—thinking is the issue. Most kids, esp Kenyans kids, due to the system, aren't taught to think in the old-kenyan system \[8-4-4\] other systems do.

You think British Curriculum kids whine when asked to do independent research or critical analysis in Year 9? You think an IB student breaks down when told to prepare a presentation or connect subjects across disciplines? You think CBSE learners get shocked when they’re expected to *understand*, not just *memorise*? No, they don't. Because they're taught critical thinking, analysis and creativity.

**Real education systems**, like what we're building rn, are the kind that produce students who can *adapt globally*, have been doing this for decades. CBC is finally trying to move Kenya into that space. And the resistance in question is coming from people who’ve been institutionalised by 8-4-4 so far in, they don't even know how to learn! It's crazy! That system trained people to only value marks, cram past papers, then flush it all out the moment exams end and say 'NIMEGRADUATE! IM SO DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL!' That’s why half the population treats education like a phase in their life rather than their foundations. This rarely happens globally, I currently live in the UK, yes, some students are like this, but most look back and are like 'fun days'. Here, it appears people almost dread education?

I’m still in the system, still learning. And *everything* CBC demands: self-teaching, project work, presentations, cross-topic thinking, personal initiative: is just standard. You can learn as a kid without a tutor. You don't need someone to be there on the board to write notes. Fuck it, when you get to higher education levels, you realize you don't even need notes! It’s what the rest of the world calls *school*. The parents calling it ""stress"" are mainly complaining because 8-4-4 coddled your mind into thinking learning only counts when it’s scribbled on a test paper.

The problem isn’t CBC. The problem is citizens got comfortable with a mediocre education system. Most were trained to perform, not understand the content. This is clearly evident ukienda mtaa. CBC is exposing that. It’s showing who can adapt and who’s just coasting. It’s showing which teachers can evolve and which ones have been using the same notes and calling it 'teaching' since 1997.

If you’re a student crying because you have to build a model or present research, understand this: **you are not being overworked, you are being educated**. Take it from me, or from anyone in higher education, they all wish they had an education like yours, or what's currently being implemented.

8-4-4 created a population that discards education the moment KCSE results drop. 'Fuck school' is not cool! CBC is trying to change that. And frankly, if it’s pissing me off that the lazy, the outdated, and the unprepared are ranting when things are finally going good. The first step to the nation is education!

Yes, the execution has flaws, but conceptually? CBC obliterates 8-4-4 10 times over. I'd argue, it is conceptually world-class, or close to that.

I’ll admit: **execution has had it's fair share of problems**.

The rollout was rushed, comms were trash/non-existant. Resources are uneven, especially in rural areas. There’s a gap between the design and infrastructure, but I'm sorry to say, but we have to let some things go. Some people have to die on the hill for others to get to the top. Would you rather have 100 students get quality education. and 10 miss out. or all 110 get mid education? It's not fair, but there has to be a sacrifice.

But a **trained teacher** complaining “I wasn’t taught this during my diploma” is wild asf to me. ou're not working in a vacuum-sealed lab where nothing changes. You're an educator. Your literal job is to *learn*, *relearn*, and *pass down understanding*. Saying “I wasn’t trained for CBC” is like an engineer saying “I wasn’t trained for AI” and expecting the field to freeze until they catch up. It’s unserious and unprofessional. If you ever told my kid that, I'm transferring them immediately!

The *content* of education changes. The *format* changes. The *tools* change. That’s the point. All global syllabi, for those of you who are familiar with it, change almost every 3 or 5years! The role of an educator is to act as a conduit for knowledge, not a gatekeeper for 'KCPE' since 2002. Be a real educator. If you can’t evolve, you shouldn’t be holding chalk.

Let me tell you a lil story: something that genuinely shook me when I was in Kenya. I was tutoring my nephew for a bit: kid's bright, curious, full of potential but how the old system had taught him to learn was LITERAL garbage. Every time I asked him *why* something worked, he’d stare blankly, he only knew how to regurgitate facts, not think about 'why?' 'how?'. Memorised notes, word-for-word, page after page.

He was obsessed with this idea that education = copying down chunks of text and cramming them till midnight. I had to step in. Took two months off everything else just to restructure his entire approach. Taught him how to *actually learn* and think. After that he started *enjoying* school. Actually *understanding* things. I, shouldn't have to do, what a teachers job should be! It's frustrating asf!

Here’s what that taught me:  
**Even the average teacher in Kenya doesn’t know how to learn.**

Let that sink in.

And I’m not talking about the ones who genuinely care and constantly update themselves. Shoutout to the real ones like Mr. Wafula—dude was a beast in class, knew how to spark minds and actually teach. We need more teachers like him.

If you're writing 100 pages of notes on the board every week and calling it teaching, you're a joke.  
If you're forcing cramming because you have no idea how to facilitate actual comprehension, you're a joke. If you're beating kids because your own insecurities get exposed when students ask questions you can’t answer, *you're a joke*.

Too many teachers are stuck in the cycle of copying, dictating, and punishing. No methodology, They expect students to adapt while they themselves remain static. If you are a teacher doing this! Get serious! Your decaying kid's future for your own selfish gains of a 'paycheck'

Let’s stop pretending the problem is CBC. The real problem is an education culture that punishes thinking and rewards cramming. CBC imo is trying to disrupt that and the resistance proves it’s needed more than ever.

Kenya,The Problem With GIRL MATH,"Today I write about women who have monetary standards they do not fund. I am very curious aboutout how that thought process works. 

Like your favorite hairstyle is something you cannot afford, and you are comfortable with always asking? You live in a house you do not pay rent for, and you call it yours? 

While I get that we have been socialized that men should provide,, I find it interesting that you can set standards you cannot afford.

We have seen women who have become homeless after a relationship ends, and  and we have seen women who were chased out of homes because they own nothing. 

I have interacted with a woman who would sabotage every job opportunity she got so she could stay at home and wait to be catered to. Me and my honesty couldn'teep quiet.

I told her to get a job and be a functioning member of society. She said she will not be in a relationship and still stress herself. Meanwhile,, she wasn't even a homemaker. See,, being a housewife is work and a contribution to humanity.It is actually one of the most demanding jobs;  she wasn't that .

She would ask for the world,, and a man would try to give her even when he was jobless. They would have conflicts,, and the dudedude would say it will get better when money comes.. She didnot love him,, and he was so in love. So he chasedd money and got so much more.  It ended in premium tears for both of them.

The truth about life is that relationships are about value. Look at families today; children are choosingg to cut parents off because the value is less than the stress,, and it will only get worse from here.

We talk about about women's's empowerment,, but we don't talk about where the line is between dependency and financial abuse.

Someone taking out out a loan to maintain you is financial abuse; someone buying you gifts to apologize for cheating is not love. Telling a man to finance you so you can be their girlfriend is financial abuse; he should do so because he loves you. 

There is a lot of bullshit you will entertain as a woman if you don't have choices; you might even start thinking you love him,, but do you?

A lot would change if women stopped looking at relationshipss as a source of livelihood. 

Baby girl,, if you had your own money,, you wouldn't date anyhow.That chronic dating thing you are doing is because you are trying to survive,, and you don't really love them. 

You jump from one relationship to another because you need rent, shopping,g, and fare.

That thing you call your type might even change once you don't depend on it to survive. 

Men complain that she changed after she got a job and started earning .

Today's question is, is that really why she changed? Have you considered that maybe she didn't like you; she liked what you could give her? Is it possible she changed because she now has choices, something she didn't have when she was depending fully on you?

Dating within your tax bracket is practical; it comes with respect and honesty. Yes relationships don't all work the same,but people who have nothing to lose will drag you to the depths of hell and feel nothing at all.

You see those independent women that the Internet likes to call names? Yes, those ones. The truth is they don't entertain bullshit just for upkeep. But you cannot relate; you would rather be treated like an afterthought as long as you get pocket change. May sense locate, may you want better for your children or even yourself .",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kndn0d/the_problem_with_girl_math/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,We need to get a President who will make looters get jailed,"By Peter Mburu | Monday, May 05, 2025 

If the State’s plan to create jobs for 90,000 youth through a Sh9.2 billion World Bank loan had worked, thousands of unemployed Kenyans would have received a lifeline.

But the Kenya Youth Employment Opportunities Programme (KYEOP) flopped as the government burned billions of shillings, leaving the stinky youth unemployment problem messier than when the initiative started in 2017.

By the time KYEOP ended in June last year, Sh15 billion had been pumped into it, with the Sh9.2 billion loan said to have benefited 87,432 youth through business start-up grants (BSG), business development services and business plan competitions to beneficiaries.

Some 248 youth got Sh3.6 million grants each, 435 received Sh900,000 grants each and each of 78,000 young people got Sh40,000.

But auditors could not trace majority of these beneficiaries last year since they were unreachable on phone or refused to give auditors directions to their premises, raising doubts that much of the money may have gone to “ghost beneficiaries”.

“For instance, out of the 308 BSG beneficiaries sampled, 98 were unreachable on phone to give directions to their businesses while 119 were non-cooperative and declined to give audience to the audit team.

Sh28 billion

“This raised doubts as to whether their businesses were up and running or they were existing beneficiaries,” the report of a special audit on the initiative stated.

Even before the ink on KYEOP reports dried, Kenya last year tapped another loan of Sh28 billion from the World Bank to start a similar programme.

The National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (Nyota) targets to offer 800,000 form four level and below youth business skills, start-up grants and jobs as a way of addressing unemployment.

The lender in February said the first batch of 20,000 beneficiaries were expected to be on board by June.

“As of January 2025, the World Bank has disbursed $13.2 million (Sh1.7 billion) equivalent, representing 6 per cent of the total project funding to support interventions for the first cycle of youth intake expected to reach up to 20,000 youth and support strengthening of requisite capacity and delivery systems,” the bank said.

Nyota has been modelled on the KYEOP framework but the World Bank says that following the KYEOP audit findings, it has introduced mitigations such as tracking funding through blockchain.

“An enhanced Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system which includes process automation, digital tools and direct feedback collection from beneficiaries was introduced. The NYOTA project will also employ blockchain technology to trace funds disbursement from the World Bank to the end beneficiaries,” it said in a statement.

Another initiative to create jobs for some 2,080 youths through a Sh4.7 billion ($36.3 million) loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) is also flopping, with an audit revealing huge gaps that have left the initiative mimicking other failed programs.

The ENABLE Youth Kenya programme—a skills and capacity development initiative to empower youths in agribusiness—was started in January 2018 and should have ended in 2022 if everything went according to plan.

At the time ENGAGE was started, Kenya was producing 500,000 youth from universities and colleges annually, but the number has since climbed to 800,000, and the programme is struggling.

While the programme deadline was extended to June, a recent audit revealed that just less than a third ($10.46 million) of the funding had been used by June last year and it continues to be hindered by gaps such as improper incubation of beneficiaries.

“The project targeted to train a total of 2,080 youth in four cohorts, each comprising of 520 youths. Review of documents, however, revealed only 432 youth in the first two cohorts or 21% of the total targeted youths, had been trained and successfully incubated,” an audit report for the year ending June 2024 indicated.

Academics and economists term the government’s initiatives as tick-box exercises rather than programmes meant to create impact on the economy, and finger development lenders for loaning Kenya to implement projects that are just money pits.

“Unfortunately, Kenya government interventions tend to be captured by short-term political interests, have limited scale, are unstructured and have a tick-box approach,” says Mr James Shikwati, a Nairobi-based economist.

Mr Shikwati says the focus should instead be on investing in re-skilling the youth to position them for the labour market since universities and colleges are not producing the skills the economy needs.

“The country’s political class needs to concretely demonstrate that it has confidence in its youth, provide incentives to employers and to initiatives that re-skill and up-skill the youth. This will trigger formalisation of initiatives that are currently absorbing over 70 per cent of Kenyan youth on low pay in the informal sector to strive to scale their operations,” he says.

Youth Affairs, Creative Economy and Sports Cabinet Secretary Salim Mvurya did not respond to questions regarding the initiatives the government has undertaken to create jobs for the youth.

University of Nairobi economics professor, Samuel Nyandemo, says the government lacks clear-cut policies on how to address unemployment and the education system is producing a higher number of graduates than the economy can absorb, hence the growing unemployment problem.

He also says the government jobs programmes collapse because of corruption, which has seen much of the funds end up in people’s pockets.

“If the lenders are concerned about how the money they provide to support employment creation in Kenya ends up being used, they should change tack and channel the money through non-governmental entities that are more accountable and make proper follow-ups,” Prof Nyandemo says.

Across all the initiatives, all that has changed has been their names, but their model has been the same. And as the government’s job programmes flop one after the other, desperation grows among Kenya’s unemployed youth.

Cases of young people leaving the country for menial jobs in the Middle East, others being scammed with promises to get jobs abroad and locally, and youth who had left the country thinking they would get jobs only to be forced to perform inhumane tasks overseas, are growing.

Sights of youth holding placards listing their qualifications are also becoming a normal phenomenon in the streets.

To make the initiatives more impactful, the Auditor-General advised that beneficiaries should repay a portion of the funding they get through the programmes to “remove the notion of free money” and make them more accountable.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics latest unemployment report, Kenyans in their 20s formed nearly three-quarters (71.8 per cent) of the unemployed population of 850,471 by 2022.

Since coming into office in 2022, President William Ruto embarked on an aggressive drive to send Kenyans for jobs abroad through a number of initiatives. But recent revelations of how youth were scammed to pay thousands of shillings through the State initiative only to be abandoned are having many who hoped to benefit through the government schemes reconsider them.

“Since late 2022, over 240,000 Kenyans have been supported in accessing overseas employment opportunities through government-led interventions,” said Diaspora Affairs Principal Secretary Roseline Njogu.

The State Department for Diaspora Affairs says it currently has five initiatives to support Kenyan youth to get jobs, including Kazi Majuu, launched in March across major towns in the country “to connect youth with global employers”.

The government also created the Diaspora Placement Agency in 2023 as a central hub for international job placements and has served as where the youth register for vacancies abroad.

“The agency vets’ opportunities and matches candidates’ skills to employers, ensuring transparency,” Ms Njogu said.

Kenya,Recommendations for Trip to Kenya in December,"
Hi,

Me and my wife are planning to travel with our parents to Kenya in the first week of December. Our parents are around 60 with few back issues and wanted your recommendations on some of our questions. We are planning a 6 day trip to Amboseli - Lake Nakuru - Masai Mara.

1. Travel from Amboseli to Lake Nakuru is around 7 hrs. Would you recommend cutting Amboseli National Park from the trip and spend another day Masai Mara?

2. Our goal of going to Amboseli is to see Mt Kilimanjaro, but with the short rains, would we be able to see the mountain?

3. Our main interest is to see all the wildlife, are 3 game drives enough in Masai Mara or should we extend our stay?

4. How is December in general for game drives?

5. Do you recommend booking package from tour operators or from hotel?

Kenya,Have the recent world occurrences exposed how much Islamists and Christians have been manipulated in equal measure?,"As a Kenya and Christian, I must say that I have come to understand Israel to be totally different from what I believed. Christians world wide have been effectively manipulated into believing in some kind of sacred relationship with modern day Israel. It's even crazy how we've been manipulated to into a responsibility of honouring these bloody killers and idol worshipers. I mean, these are people who literally setup a national ceremony for animal blood sacrifice. These are people who've created and funded terrorist groups that massacred fir decades, and are  currently beheading Christians in Syria. Like, we're supposed to worship 

It's safe to say this notion of sacred Israel is a result of not reading the bible properly. Because the modern day nation of Israel is NOT that of the bible. 

Looking at Islam world, the manipulation has been by Saudi, Qatar, UAE dictatorial theocracies. These scums sponsor the extremist Wahhabism ideology (the one Sheikh Makaburi had started in the coast) that preaches hatred and death to Islael, US and kafirs. They fund Wahhabism indoctrination cells outside their countries, including Middle East, Africa and Asia.

Kenya,Vietnam gas CEO,"TL;DR: Kenya's development challenges are deeply rooted in geography and history, not just corruption—so infrastructure like roads is essential, even if costly.

The Vietnam Gas CEO made a post criticizing Musalia and Co., and I’ve seen many Kenyans repeat it endlessly and praise the CEO. And herein lies a problem: it appears that many Kenyans have no clue about how the economy functions or what truly ails our economy. I used to think it was just the older folk—as indicated by the cheers when a politician said ""we don’t eat roads""—but I’m surprised to see that even us Gen Z folk have very little understanding of economics, especially developmental economics. Ask any person on the street and they immediately give the NPC answer of ""corruption is the problem."" And yes, corruption is a problem—but fighting corruption alone won’t turn Kenya into Singapore or South Korea.

Africa as a whole has a huge problem that isn’t of our own making. It’s a result of our geography. There’s a shortage of navigable rivers where we can build canals and use them to transport people and goods and conduct trade. The wheel was not in widespread use on the continent, and the presence of tsetse flies and ticks discouraged the use of horses and pack animals too. Tropical diseases and very high infant mortality kept population densities low. All these meant that, for a long time, African societies lived in small, self-sufficient communities scattered across the continent. Due to limited contact with each other, ideas and trade didn’t spread easily, and as such, the emergence of strong centralized polities like those found in Europe and Asia was limited.

Trade is a crucial factor in the emergence of such polities. Indeed, if you look at Africa, you’ll note that most of the strongest kingdoms emerged in the West—and it was after the introduction of the camel and horses. In West Africa, the tribes tend to be very large entities (e.g., Hausa, Fulani) and are spread out over large geographical areas. That’s not a coincidence. Every African country that has had a centralized polity tends to have one very large ethnic group, and some—like Rwanda and Burundi—are almost ethnostates. This is because they absorbed many of the smaller entities around them during their expansion. In contrast, in places like Kenya where such entities didn’t truly exist, we ended up with a scattering of many different tribes.

The lack of trading and strong centralized polities (which could tax the trade) meant that there was never truly a large accumulation of wealth/resources in most African countries—wealth that could be used to fund a bureaucracy, standing armies, or large projects such as irrigation works, palaces, walled cities, etc. (Again, look at West Africa—strong centralized polities + transatlantic/trans-Saharan trade = Timbuktu, Benin Bronzes, etc.).

All these roads lead to a place called poverty and underdevelopment-ville (make no mistake, poverty was rampant). The first thing you do before anything else, if you want to develop such a place, is build proper transport and communications infrastructure. But the terrain in Africa makes that very expensive. We don’t have many navigable rivers for canals (which are cheap), and the elevation of the continent makes it very expensive to build railways. So we’re left with one option: build roads. Roads are expensive to build, and road transport is more costly than rail or water transport. But we have no choice.

Without those roads, two things happen: first, the volume of trade is drastically reduced; and second, governments lack enough revenue. Without proper transport infrastructure, they can’t tax even the little trade going on. Without revenue, the government can’t pay for a bureaucracy or even provide basic services such as security. And here’s what most people fail to understand: fighting corruption isn’t cheap. Good governance costs money. Economic reform costs money—a lot of money. Just look at how much developed countries spend on their police, investigative agencies, and justice ministries per year.

The Vietnamese CEO is criticizing the Mombasa Expressway while forgetting that his country has not one, but two expressways—the Mekong and Red Rivers—provided by nature. Kenya doesn’t have anything of the sort. We have to build it ourselves and then tax the trade it facilitates and use that revenue to fund industrial growth—just like they did. By the way, many of these communist countries never tell you that they literally starved millions of their citizens to death to pay for early industrialization. Remember the Great Chinese Famine? The Soviet famines of the 1930s? Even Vietnam came very close—where do you think the boat people came from? In South Korea, people were literally working like slaves. There’s a story I read about girls as young as 14 working 15-hour days in textile factories, getting only two days off a month.

Kenya,Thieves. Rotten.,"Kenya is full of thieves. No morals. Rotten to the core. 

Think about the last time you wanted to see good deeds from the government and people..how did it turn out? I see the general public complaining about what the government should and shouldn't do, yet they elected them. 

The general public complaining is full of unpaid loans in their folios because they want the lender to suffer - but they can't see that, they have to 'project' their anger.

The general public steals whenever theirs a chance, from building materials to hospitals, to public funds availed to them! 

Where is Kenya headed to? Kenya was in the same league with some very 'rich' countries right now, but corruption stinks it. Have you had a look at one of Kenya's international airports? Looks like a cow shed.

Other African countries around her do so well - or try to. Rwanda, Ethiopia, Egypt, South Africa to mention a couple. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k5tw8e/thieves_rotten/,,usaid kenya funding cut
Kenya,Private Equity Funds in Kenya,"You may not be aware, but many of our expenditures today benefit Private Equity (PE) funds. They are crowding into Kenya to get a piece of the pie. With our lax laws and poor regulation, these funds are having a field day.

PE funds now own or back Java, Naivas, Quickmart, Goodlife Pharmacies, and several private hospitals. We’re even considering PE funds for the Nairobi–Mombasa toll road.

We all know their endgame: high shareholder returns and flipping the business for a profit. It's no wonder Java has near-monthly price hikes. 

We’re gradually losing control of essential sectors to entities whose primary concern is not service or affordability but short-term financial gain. With limited public oversight, this trend will likely continue unchecked.

Do you think we should be worried? Or is this just the price of development?

Kenya,Most men nowadays are mentally weak.,"There is a trending story about a popular Kenyan couple. Men are defending the man using the simplistic reasoning that men budget for their affairs which I find ridiculous. These are the same men who complain that women nowadays are after money, which is not wrong but what do you expect when it is the only flex you have? I know there are men who will agree with me that affairs are expensive and time consuming. Trying to hide an affair is a lot of hard work and mental gymnastics, or maybe I am just an amateur. I have cheated emotionally on a girl, the girl I talked about in my post on Valentines, here is the link https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1im2hwi/my\_simp\_era\_valentine\_edition/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button. I don't know if that was cheating but after a certain incident I checked out of the relationship. When I asked for a break up, she wouldn't agree. At first, I tried my best to hide it, realized it was a lot of work and did it openly to push her away. We eventually broke up but for some other reason. From that experience, I learned that cheating was hard. Is that cheating since I had already withdrawn my commitment to her?

I find using an excuse like budgeting for affairs very simplistic. As a man, why are you even budgeting for affairs? That money could be put to better use. Donate to charity, sponsor a child through high school, save, buy stocks or appreciating assets, travel. The possibilities are endless. If you have to part with money to keep an affair alive you are down bad. It's worse when you have a wife or girlfriend. Also, what's up with all the infidelity? Don't you guys have self control. One thing I learned about being a man is that it is more about how you tame your sexual desires. Self control is the hallmark, the gold standard for masculinity. Plus it is the woman who is benefitting, not you. The only thing you get in exchange is a wet crack, nothing more. The woman on the other side is getting money to fund her lifestyle, if she clever enough, invest. You mean you would rather spend on her than your wife? 

Modern men are increasingly become weaker mentally and it is sad to see. I now understand why women are making better progress nowadays. These women are ruthless and very intelligent. They don't play with their money like men are doing. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k47i3j/most_men_nowadays_are_mentally_weak/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,Why are we playing so safe?,"I recently came across a group of guys online building hardwares like keyboards; beautifully designed ones. Transparent bodies that show the internal wiring, custom keycaps, artistic builds using different materials. It wasn’t about mass production or getting rich, it was about passion. They were just playing with the craft, exploring it.

And it made me think about software, which is my space. You look outside Kenya and you see people building amazing tools:

Perplexity AI — just using open AI models and a bit of code to rethink how we search the web.

Arc and Zen Browsers — basically Chrome and Firefox underneath, but reimagined with a fresh, thoughtful design.

Fellow devs know Supabase, Planetscale, Neon DB — not revolutionary ideas, but polished tools built on existing open-source databases that solve real developer problems in elegant ways.


Over here, we mostly get another delivery app, another finance app, another ""AI girlfriend."" Even in fashion, it’s the same formula, slap a logo or quote on a blank tee and sell it as a brand. Everyone's chasing virality and “quick money,” but very few are building with care, with vision.

And it’s not just tech or fashion. In real estate, almost every property is either a high-rise apartment or a huge mansion. Nothing in between. No townhouses, no duplexes, no creative use of small spaces. Interiors are the same grey tiles, same wardrobes, same white lighting. It’s like we copied one Pinterest board and called it a day. There’s no personality in most of what we build anymore.

But I get it. People are in survival mode. Graduates want stability first. Manufacturing is hard. Logistics are unreliable. Funding is scarce. And the saddest part is that we don’t have a strong consumer culture that appreciates thoughtful, original work. So when someone actually tries to do something different, they’re often ignored, underpaid or burnt out.

This has a ripple effect. Music starts sounding the same. Apps solve the same problems. Homes all look alike. Fashion feels soulless.
And slowly, we lose our sense of wonder and our ability to imagine and build something just because it feels meaningful.

Maybe this post won’t fix anything. But maybe it resonates with someone. Because I know I’m not the only one who wants more. More soul. More play. More risk. More weird, beautiful ideas and more of the kind that make you feel something.

Anyone else feeling this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jx7itx/why_are_we_playing_so_safe/,,usaid kenya funding cut
Kenya,Sign the Petition to Declare Femicide a Crime in Kenya,"Why this petition matters


Started by Usikimye Kenya
Media inquiries
Every two days, a woman in Kenya is murdered simply because she is a woman.
This is not just another tragedy—this is femicide, the intentional killing of women because of their gender, rooted in deep-seated violence and discrimination.  
The situation is dire. In 2024 alone, at least 170 women were killed—the highest annual toll on record. Shockingly, recent reports show an average of one woman murdered every day in the past week. Yet despite this crisis, Kenya does not legally recognize femicide as a distinct crime. Without this recognition, these killings are ignored, poorly tracked, and often go unpunished.  
Why This Matters?
🔴 No Recognition, No Justice – Femicide is treated as just another homicide, allowing perpetrators to evade accountability.  
🔴 A Deadly Pattern We Can’t Ignore – These murders keep happening because the root causes—misogyny and systemic discrimination—are overlooked.  
🔴 Naming It Saves Lives – Countries like Mexico, Argentina, and Italy have recognized femicide as a crime, leading to stronger laws, better investigations, and greater protections for women.  
Kenya has the chance to be the first African nation to take this critical step—setting a powerful example for the continent and affirming that women’s lives matter.  
Our Demands
We call on the Kenyan government to:  
✅ Legally define femicide as a distinct crime to ensure proper tracking and accountability.  
✅ Strengthen laws and policies to prevent these killings and protect women.  
✅ Guarantee thorough investigations and justice for victims.  
✅ Increase funding for survivor support services.  
We have laws protecting property and money—yet when a woman’s life is stolen for being a woman, the system fails her. This must change.  
Justice begins with recognition. Justice begins with us.  
Sign this petition today to demand Kenya declare femicide a crime.

Kenya,When Kevo went to buy a Toyota Fielder in Mombasa… (Brace yourself),"Kevo is still too traumatized to speak in full sentences. 😭

So Kevo decides he’s done being carless in Nairobi. Tired of begging Ubers and being told *“siko mbali, niko tao”* by a guy in Rongai.

So Kevo jets down to Mombasa,  lands  like a king. Shirt open, chest out, stress low to buy a Toyota Fielder from his boy who owns Alasiri Motors. They went to the same high school, both got suspended for reasons we don’t discuss anymore. Straightforward mission. Car is smooth, engine purrs like a cat that pays rent. Everything is clicking.  
BUT.  
This is Kevo we’re talking about. A man who has never seen red flags. Only maroon decorations. 😩  
After the car deal, Kevo turns to Alasiri and says: ""Bro... I’ve never clapped buibui cheeks. Sasa niko Coast, si mnipee experience ya wenyeji""

INSTEAD of telling him to pray and go sleep, Alasiri claps his hands like Thanos and goes,  
“Weh. Umefika. Wacha nicheze kama mimi.”

They roll up to Bamburi. You know that place where logic goes to die and thighs roam free like devolution funds.  
They hit the club.  
Lights dim. Music loud.  
Enter: vodka + poor decisions combo pack (Kenya Cane + ego).

Then Kevo sees *HER*.  
Tall. Graceful. Wrapped in a black buibui like she was hiding state secrets and heartbreak.  
The way her fabric floated in the coastal breeze? Bro almost proposed right there with airtime.

Kevo leans to Alasiri and whispers,  
*""Bro, hiyo ni wife material ya UAE. She’s wrapped like economy is hard but heart is soft.""*

Kevo approaches her with the swagger of a man who’s never known defeat, only delays.  
Drops a few lies.  
Mentions he owns land in Kamulu and drives a hybrid.  
Buibui giggles. (Kevo took it as flirtation. It was witchcraft 🧙🏾‍♂️)

She agrees to roll back to his hotel.

Alasiri, like a good wingman, drops them at the hotel around 11:15PM.  
Then dips. Switches to husband mode. Phone on DND.  
Bro is unavailable like NHIF when you need it most.

**THEN.**

Morning comes.  
Alasiri opens his eyes to 22 MISSED CALLS from Kevo.  
From 2AM to 6:30AM.  
Even God was still buffering. But Kevo? Fighting demons.

He calls back.

Kevo picks on the first ring, breathless. Voice trembling like a Safaricom MPESA outage.“BROOOOOOOO... HII BUIBUI... SI NI KIJAMAA!!!!! 😭😭😭”

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Plot twist from Riverwood itself.  
The “mrembo” was a fully assembled man.  
Guy had more equipment than a boda boda spare parts shop.

Apparently, things got spicy. Kevo reached to ""unveil the mystery"" like Moses and the burning bush...  
Only to find a **shock absorber**.

He screamed so loud the hotel wanted to change their name to *""Whispers Inn.""*

The buibui bro, completely unbothered, sipped water and said:  
“Si I thought we were vibing?”

**VIBING WHERE??? IN GETHSEMANE???**

Kevo lost it.

Started rebuking the room like it owed him rent.  
Shouted “Rudi nyuma shetani!” DRUNK, while holding a Gideon’s Bible from the drawer.  
Tried to jump out the window in boxers with one sock.  
Security came thinking there was a robbery.  
Manager knocked.  
Buibui bro sat calmly, legs crossed, sipping his/her Keringet like “I did nothing. He picked me.” 💅

Kevo’s soul left his body three times that night.  
But Alasiri? Bro was snoring in his matrimonial bed. Dreaming of loyalty and lentils.

Kenya,MEXT,"

Last year I made a post informing people about the existence of this scholarship. 
I just wanted to remind you guys early enough this year. 

And I also decided to repost a comment I had made last year regarding the process. 

The process.(For people planning to apply for postgraduate studies; masters and PhD)

1st step is document screening.

They'll need a bunch of documents from you. An application form, which can be downloaded from their website, medical form, research proposal, certified documents( So you'll need to go to your school to have your degree and transcripts certified), and a recommendation letter( I think they insisted on this letter being from the Dean of studies, but I got mine from my department head). Also, a passport photo of you.

Last year, the documents were required in 3s. So if it's the application form, you fill it out, print it out, then make 2 more copies. Same with other documents. Don't staple the documents together. Use paper clips to attach them together.

All the documents will need to be dispatched at the Japanese embassy. It's located in upperhill, very close to CIC insurance building.

But it's important to check the website because they might need more or less documents for this year.

I should mention that there's a section on the application form that requires the applicant to list down 3 universities of choice. This section is usually super confusing if you don't know any Japanese universities but just look up 3 universities that have your course and write them down. This section can be changed later. But you do need to remember the universities you picked because they like to ask applicants during the interview stage to just mention the 3 universities they picked became they know we usually randomly pick.

2nd step English and Japanese Exam

If you pass the first stage, they'll call you for an English and Japanese written exam at the Japanese embassy. For Japanese, just guess, it's multiple choice, so just pick anything and hand in the paper. The Japanese exam exists to check your proficiency in the language. So, if you aren't proficient, then just show them that you aren't.

But for English, you need to get everything or nearly everything. The website usually has some past papers attached for anyone who needs to practise a bit before the exams. Go through the papers and familiarise yourself with the content. The English exam is not usually hard, but it's tricky. It's one of those papers where A and B can seem like probable answers, and you need to pick one. Time also runs very fast, and last year, they didn't add any time, so some people didn't make it because they did not finish in time. Also, if you dig around online, you'll find more papers. It's very important to do more papers. I did 10 papers.  It helped a lot.

3rd Step Interview

If you pass the second step, they'll call you for an interview. The interview is usually scheduled a few days after the exams. I did the exam on Friday and got a call on Monday afternoon about an interview that was scheduled for Tuesday. The questions will be general at first, questions like 'Why Japan as the country of choice?' 'How sure are you that you'll complete the course?' Etc. To questions that focus solely on your research proposal. Don't ignore small things like knowing the full title of your project, the objectives, the methodology, etc. They might also ask you to explain in brief more about the proposal.

Also, I should mention that because this scholarship is annual, they are a lot of people who have already gone through the process which means there are a lot of YouTube videos that can help you prepare for this part. They usually ask the same questions every year. There's also a MEXT sub that helped me a lot when I was applying.

4th Step: Application to universities in Japan

If you pass the 3rd step, they will call you again to present to you a 'certificate of first screening'. Which means you've completed the first stage. This stage usually involves contacting universities, more specifically, professors, asking them if they can take you as a student. The facilitators of the scholarship will email you a long list of universities plus their email contact, and it's your job to look up the universities and find a couple that you'd like to contact. When looking up universities, it's important to make sure the language of instruction for teaching is English because there's a very huge possibility that some programs are offered in Japanese only..

Remember how I mentioned that the universities you picked when you were filling out the application form could be changed. This is where you will change them.

You'll be given about a month to do this step.and in the end, you need to get at least 2 professors who will agree to take you up. The professors usually send you a letter of acceptance that you'll give the embassy much later. Around October, I think. They'll also ask you to rank the schools in order of priority even though they'll probably be the ones to make the final selection at the end. The rule of thumb is that public universities will be prioritized over private ones because they are cheaper to fund. 

I should mention that it's nearly impossible to miss out on the scholarship after passing the interview stage. Because it hasn't happened in 18 years that a student has missed the chance after passing the interview. But you still need to be diligent with the entire process.

5th Step Waiting Stage.

The deadline for submission of the letters of acceptances will probably be in October. And after you dispatch the letters at the Embassy, you'll just have to wait until they contact you again.

I really didn't like this stage because they went quiet till Feb this year. You might get hints from the school that picked you through emails explaining things like arrival dates and entrance exams to be taken, if any, but the embassy  will not communicate until Feb.

My hints started coming around December. But it was hard to know which school the Embassy had picked, so I still had to wait until the final communication was made. This year, they communicated around Feb 15th 2024. But I should mention, after that date things will start moving very very fast.

One last important thing is that even though the scholarship is funded, they will need you to source around 2000 dollars for the first month. This is usually required because they need you to open a Japanese bank account that they will be depositing your stipend in, and you can't open the bank account from Kenya. The stipend is around 144,000 yen. Because the currency rates have been fluctuating alot one of the facilitators told me that anything above 1000 dollars would still be good enough.

Last thing, If you get past the interview stage, start learning Japanese immediately. You can use duolingo to learn small introductions and also the Japanese alphabet. I've just started the classes, and they are rather intense 😅.

I’ll also include the link to the embassy here https://www.ke.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/Postgraduate.html. 

The link should have the application documents needed and also similar outline to the lengthy process I described above. 

If you need any guidance you can reach out, but please read the very lengthy process I’ve outlined below before reaching out. And also visit the website. 

Things might have changed so it’s critical to visit the website. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jrso38/mext/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,What’s Happening to the Kenyan Youth? A Reflection on Violence and Rejection!,"Another tragic story unfolds—a young girl’s life cut short, her body reportedly hidden in a water tank above a hostel. The suspected perpetrator? Her boyfriend. This heartbreaking incident raises urgent questions about the state of our youth today.

What is happening to our young men and women? Is rejection so unbearable that it drives some to commit such heinous acts? As Gen Z navigates a world of social media pressures, economic challenges, and shifting cultural norms, are we failing to equip them with the tools to handle rejection, disappointment, and conflict?

Statistics paint a concerning picture. In Kenya, youth unemployment stands at a staggering 35%, compared to the national average of 10%. Substance abuse and mental health issues are also on the rise, with leaders urging communities to address these challenges. Additionally, 75% of Kenya’s population is under 35, meaning the youth are not just the future—they are the present.

We’ve all faced rejection in our lives, yet we moved on. Why does it seem harder for today’s youth? Is it the lack of mentorship, the erosion of traditional values, or the overwhelming influence of digital culture?

Let’s discuss: How can we better support our youth to navigate life’s challenges without resorting to violence?

Kenya,Tanzania's on a new ruthless offensive against Kenya: New taxes targeting Kenya's critical exports.,"

Tanzania has hit Kenya with a new wave of taxes. This time, targeting eggs, dairy and manufactured goods including yoghurt, milk, biscuits, sweets, and chocolate. 

The new taxes are charged on weight, at ksh50 (TSH 1,000) per KG of imports. These taxes will worsen the pain of our already-struggling manufacturing sector. In 2024, our exports to TZ fell by a staggering ksh 4.2 billion due import duties. 

TZ is coupling these taxes with secret incentives and inducements  with an ultimate goal of attracting Kenya manufacturing towards Tanzania. 

It noteworthy that Tanzania is promising investors lucrative enticements, including economic and political stability and access to a larger market. TZ can access to both EAC and SADC. That's why they are particularly keen on the latter, as it offers a bigger market, at $1.2 Trillion compared to $296 billion of EAC. TZ also enjoys good diplomatic relationship with EAC members and has cemented it's export position to Uganda, DRC, Rwanda, Burundi. Thus, they have the luxury of alienating Kenya and continue enjoying EAC benefits.

Kenya,African American Letdowns,"The AA community has been considering Nairobi as an alternative destination that previously was Accra in Ghana.

My only concern is the caliber of AA we’re getting. Look at the likes of Brandon Odira and the others are only out here to sleep around and fulfill their sexual desires because most of them wouldn’t be getting laid back in the States where women are empowered and smart. 

Back to the topic, why don’t we attract a high caliber of AA folks who can create Enterprise Businesses, Cutting Edge technology and even School for Gifted Kids? Maybe they we’re being judged by their character all along and not the color of their skin (joking).

Kenya,Would you take her back?,"(**Update:** He broke up with me so you guys don't have to comment to leave him anymore)

 I (22F) have been seeing a guy (29M) for nearly 6 months now. I fell for him really hard at the start, but he didn't seem to feel the same way. It seemed like he was just there for a good time so I went with it, just happy to be around. We would have these disagreements, and he would ghost me for 1-2 weeks every time. Regardless of who was actually in the wrong, I would apologize and wait for him. The first time this happened I found out he slept with another girl. I was upset, and after that we made things exclusive. I never asked any questions about the girl or their relationship, I just trusted it wouldn't happen again. He had to leave the country abruptly for a month and again, I waited for him. I didn't speak to any other guys. In general I'm very reclusive and hardly speak to anyone outside of work/family, so its not like this was some massive exertion on my end.

He came back, and another incident happened where he ghosted me for something HE did wrong. Again I apologized. He traveled somewhere for New Years and he only told me like the day before he left. I also had plans with friends so I brushed it off and never really worried about what he got up to on his trip, whereas he was constantly speculating that I slept with other guys on mine (I didn't)

After New Years things got more real between us. I feel like he got more vulnerable and he also ended up telling me he loved me and wanted something long term. This meant a lot to me because he's normally so emotionally closed off that I never expected it. Despite the fact that his behaviour often signaled otherwise, I decided to believe him and we were locked in from there.

Everything was perfect until an incident happened this one night. It was an accident, I basically broke something VERY VERY important of his. ACCIDENTALLY. It sucked because I couldn't come up with any tangible solutions to fix it (It was really expensive) so all I could say was sorry. Immediately after it happened he told me he had to leave the country to fix it and sent me home with no further word. I texted him apologizing again (It was really all I could do) and I got ghosted again. Now, going off of what he told me I assumed he actually up and left the country without saying anything at all to me, even though he knew that it was an accident. After everything this was lowkey my last straw and I decided it made sense to just move on. Like if a broken item is all it takes for you to decide you've had enough of me then I should just see myself out.

So after being ghosted I made a decided effort to find someone else. This isn't something I would typically do but I felt really hurt and abandoned and I just needed someone to validate me. I started texting another guy. We actually got on, to the point that he started planning a date. I get home from work the day the date was scheduled and start to get ready and guess who had texted? The same guy who ghosted me. Turns out he managed to fix the problem here in Kenya and was still around. He wanted to see me and I immediately blew off the other guy. I met up with him and we pick up where we left off.

Here's where the problem arises. At some point during our interaction he grabbed my phone...and saw texts from another guy. I panic, grab my phone back and just completely refuse to show him the chat. We went back and forth about it the entire night with no conclusion. At some point he made me block the guy. I did but I unblocked him right after (I still felt like we were on rocky terms and I subconsciously wanted the other guy as back up). A couple of days later, the same thing happens. The guy I blew off texted me trying to reschedule the date and my man saw it. He didn't see the exact text but he saw a message from another guy and started demanding to see it. Again I refuse and frantically made up excuses about who the text was from, but deep down he didn't buy it.

At this point I realize its become too much, so I cut all contact with the other guy and never look back. Despite this, the whole scenario is now a point of contention in my situationship. It gets to the point that my man asks for my instagram password and I give it to him, but first I blocked the guy who had wanted to take me out so my man wouldn't see. Turns out he was looking at my follower count the whole time and saw it go down by one when he asked for my password lol.

At this point I just decided to tell him the truth. I accepted that he might not want to be with me but he should at least know what actually happened. Once I tell him that I almost went on a date with another guy and that I would have, had he not texted me at that exact moment, he starts crashing out. Saying I always had ""bop tendencies"" that he ignored, asking me invasive questions about my body count. Telling me he thinks I've been sleeping with other guys while he's away and that he can't trust me to hold it down while he's out of the country if it only took me days to move on after he ghosted me. In his defense I haven't been transparent and I can see why his mind would go to the worst case scenario, but none of that is true. I haven't slept with anyone else since the day I met him, I don't go out unless its with him and after that one disaster I haven't texted ANY other guys.

He logged into my instagram and he's now convinced that I deleted a bunch of chats so that he wouldn't see (I didn't, like I said earlier I just don't speak to people in general). He said he needs time to think, and that he feels like logically he can't trust me to be his girl. From a logical perspective I can empathize but at the same time I literally didn't actually do anything?? Yes I spoke to another guy when he GHOSTED me but I didn't let it actually go anywhere? He genuinely seems devastated and I feel bad because the truth isn't THAAAT bad but he's genuinely convinced himself that I've cheated when I fully haven't.

Kenya,Ruto and Jayesh Saini have ruined our public health system,"Around december the [daily nation](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/mystery-supplier-to-get-sha-billions-4843936#story) reported that GoK had secretly entered into a hospital equipment leasing scheme dubbed the National Equipment Support Program[NESP]. Governors were [coereced](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/12/ruto-terms-kahigas-coercion-claims-in-county-medical-lease-scheme-untrue/) into signing those agreements with wahindi brokers (the jayesh saini cartel). Instead of going directly to original equipment manufacturers like GE and ROCHE - ruto's regime went to the brokers (recently a CT scan burst into [flames](https://www.citizen.digital/wananchi-reporting/ct-scan-machine-at-kericho-hospital-destroyed-in-fire-n358467) at kericho). Under  [Uhuru](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/ge-to-admit-first-batch-of-health-workers-at-sh1-3bn-training-hub--2118720) - we also had an equipment leasing program [MES] but most of it was with OEMs. They would directly provide support services.

Now here comes the juicy part - under the NESP agreement. For each claim under SHA in public hospitals, the hospitals are required to pay [60%](https://x.com/Dialmaterialist/status/1895086475378565308?t=BRr6Fp_JYr9BkrVqGQFmgQ&s=19) of that figure to  the vendors (equipment brokers). SHA makes direct payment to the vendors. Public hospitals will never touch the 60%.

We now move to the second part of the [SHA heist](https://x.com/Martowachira/status/1896617548403322902?t=DfZOTcpT5yv7nZt5d1u5QQ&s=19). The consortium of Apeiro, Safaricom and Konvergenz network solutions, which has 104 billion agreement gets 5% of all hospital claims and  1.5% for a track and trace solution. On top, they also get 2.5% of all member contributions made to SHA.


Therefore, ruto and the wahindi brokers get 60% +5% +1.5% + 2.5% of all member contributions = 66.5% + 2.5% of the total SHA collection per month/year

That leaves public hospitals with approximately ~30% to run their operations. Assuming they were to be self-sustaining, the 30% would have to cater for staff of all cadres, acquire drugs from KEMSA, electricity bills, water, waste disposal, repairs etc

You can also factor in the [frequent delays](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/counties-hit-as-treasury-delays-cash-disbursements-4763402) in transferring devolved funds  to county governments -

Consequentially, public hospitals can't function effectively under this system.

Faith- based hospitals are somehow able to survive because they don't have to pay 60% to the wahindi brokers for leased medical equipment

Kenya,Kenya’s Economic Reality: Why Fighting Corruption Alone Won’t Fix Our Problems,"I was having a discussion with my friends about the state of sports in Kenya, and one of them was passionately arguing that the government does very little to support sports. While that’s true, a deeper look at successful sports industries worldwide shows that sports are largely private enterprises. Private investors own the teams, sponsor the leagues, and build the stadiums. The same applies to most thriving industries—large businesses that employ thousands are privately owned, not run by the state. Governments, after all, tend to be inefficient economic managers.

This got me thinking about Kenya’s economy and the role of government in development.

Our Revenue vs. Spending Needs

Last year, KRA collected KES 2.4 trillion in taxes, which sounds like a lot, but in reality, it’s far from enough. If we were to fund the country’s essential sectors at functional—not even first-world—levels, we would need:

Education – KES 850 billion

Healthcare – KES 700 billion

Police & Interior – KES 425 billion

Judiciary – KES 80 billion

County Allocations – KES 650 billion

Defense – KES 700 billion

Infrastructure Development – KES 1.2 trillion

Annual Debt Repayments – KES 1.85 trillion


That’s a total of KES 6 trillion per year, yet we only collect about KES 2.5 trillion, leaving a KES 3.5 trillion gap.

Corruption Isn’t the Only Problem

Many politicians and activists keep repeating the same talking point: ""We need to fight corruption."" Sure, corruption is a problem, but let’s be realistic—it won’t magically bridge this revenue gap. Even if we eliminated corruption completely and spent every shilling efficiently, we’d still be working with half the money we actually need—just enough to survive, not thrive.

This is where Kenya’s leadership has consistently failed. Where are the comprehensive economic policies? Where are the white papers outlining how we move from an economy based on agriculture and low-value industries to a high-value, industrialized economy?

The Missing Conversation: Private Investment & Economic Growth

Morara Kebaso, Martha Karua, and other critics of the current regime talk endlessly about corruption, but where is their economic plan? What strategies do they have for:

- Attracting private investors?

- Encouraging industrialization and manufacturing?

- Reducing reliance on primary production and low-value industries?


It is not the government’s job to build businesses or factories. The government’s role should be to create an environment where private investors can thrive—this means:

1. Security – Investors won’t risk their money in unstable environments.


2. A strong legal system – Property rights must be guaranteed.


3. Infrastructure – Roads, electricity, and digital connectivity must be in place.



Yet, these topics are rarely discussed in Kenyan political discourse.

Fighting Corruption is Expensive

If we’re serious about fighting corruption, we need to acknowledge something crucial—it’s hella expensive.

To effectively combat corruption, Kenya needs:

A well-funded judiciary – Corruption trials take time, resources, and skilled legal teams.

A strong police force – Anti-corruption agencies need proper funding and independence.

A capable defense system – A strong military isn’t just about external threats; it ensures national stability and can deter external actors who enable corruption (e.g., countries where corrupt officials stash their money).


Without this, anti-corruption rhetoric remains just that—rhetoric.

Kenya’s Stagnation: The Economics of Poverty

At the end of the day, we are stuck in a cycle where we don’t generate enough wealth to fund our institutions, yet we expect those same underfunded institutions to drive change. It won’t happen. We need to:

1. Shift our economic focus from primary production to value addition and industrialization.


2. Encourage private sector growth instead of looking to the government for everything.


3. Prioritize economic policies over empty political slogans.



Until then, we will remain trapped in the economics of poverty, talking about corruption while ignoring the bigger picture.

Kenya,Honest question: Why nations fail?,"For context, I'm a student at a public university in the capital. So at various points this week, I've had discussions with my classmates on the trajectory of attaining wealth in the Kenyan sphere.

With a dose of reality, we came to the conclusion that its in Politics, industry (owning means of production) or a successful professional career.

But more emphasis is the route of politics. Is it a coincidence that our last 2 presidents are the top 10 richest people in the country? What business can Ruto or other politicians like Murkommen & Gachagua claim to have given them billions of shillings via entrepreneurship?

So the way I see it, most young people are potential thieves without opportunity. What stuck out to me the most was my classmates who are vying for student leadership positions are the ones most vocal in using political office to get 'fuck you money'.

And honestly, it's hard to blame them. There's a clear lack of entrepreneur role models in this country to whom the youth can look up to to inspire them to be titans of industry in the future. Not by stealing public funds, but by solving problems in the market.

22 year olds in the US, Estonia , China etc are looking to BUILD startups to be the next Sam Altman, Jack ma, and Elons. Here, 22 year olds are looking to form new political parties so as to gain power and rob the public they're meant to serve.

This is WHY NATIONS FAIL. When greed is allowed to fester, the country becomes an open wound. 

100 years from now, if we allow Kenya to weaken as our neighbors grow in strength, will we even be able to defend our borders? Will our children and grandchildren look forward to stay, work , love and grow their families here? Will we even be able to feed ourselves? That is the long term we need to see. Unless your plan is to emigrate, then enrich yourself by all means.

Kenya,Rotten.,"Kasongo must go. 'Disclaimer: long story' 
But is he the only one really.? 

Kenyans we are good people. Very patriotic, very hospitable and all. On the books, yeah , On the screen. Well, there are genuine good people in this land. How many are they though. 

When it comes to money, who are you. Because weeeeeelllll......

I remember a few months after my graduation, i was calmly  job hunting. I wasnt it a hurry to get employed since I had already heard the phrase that tarmacking was a job in itself🤭 , Yaani my expectations were deep there with the manure. So this girl tells me, 'Baba dogo Kuna recruitments, lets go try our luck' Mimi huyo na vijikaratasi vyangu tumejibeba to there. The queue...! Wueeh You'd think it was relief food being distributed.. Anyway, we got in the queue.  By the way, it wasnt moving at all 😂 for the almost 3 hours i was there. Then comes this mama  looks at us and calls us aside. Wueeh turns out, 'bila doo tutajichomoa mipango iko na hatuezi haribu'' 😅 Wueeh, my trust in ONESTI couldnt allow me. told myself, ill not get conned in this Nairobi. The girl i was with was a bit more desperate akamake some calls and when she asked for a number to send to akapewa... (Not very smart as ive met a few penny gluttons who dont keep receipts. cash only).. Anyway after a while  few ( about 4 place nilikua) wakatoa. it was about 7000 shillings if i can remember correctly. So wakatengwa  and their names were called in. I bought some mayai pasua and ate to relieve my anger. Not hunger... I was Angry! 😠... Not because i couldnt afford the amount. Well.. i couldnt🤭.. But thats not the point. I thought Kenyans were better people..  

A few weeks later I went to this other place where a very nice 'Religious' Lady, Required some 5K to facilitate recruitment.. i mean the stories are endless . 
So currently i Work in a factory. I worked here for a bout a year then left to another place then came back. My role involes facilitating recruitments within my department doing interviews and all that. Not to say Im an angel but i have never demanded or suggested payment of any kind the first time i was here or now . While i was gone, they employed this woman to my position. Adding to the fact that shes a narcissist and is always looking for a reason to get people fired, man..! this one exceeds kasongo . So due to my position im usually incapable of handling the interviews so she does.. So i got concerned with thd high rate of tutnovers we had at our department and decided to dig around. Turns out she operates a 'school' where people pay 10000 sh for a two hour session on what theyll be asked in the interview. I left a team of about 60 people,, and on coming back, less than a year later, only less than 5 of the original personnel were left. and these ones..?? they eat dust on a daily basis to try and get them to quit!.. So i organised a small recruitment to try and fill in some gaps, about 7 people. These ones have been eating dust as well since 'hawakutithe'.  so comes this lady one time with cash about 5k. (One of the ones i had recruited) hands it to me. i ask her what its for. she tells me, 'sikua najua ntamalizia hiyo ingine next month' Im like .. 'Whaaat!???' So apparently ile mbio alipelekwa on asking around why she was told people give a certain amount during onboarding. Na aty nobody asks for it, aty hao they gave their 'tithe' Before recruitment. Who is being given the money ? 'Mwenye alikuinterview' they didnt know it was me since i rarely do interviews now. so she thought it could be because she gave nothing that shes being targeted and bullied 24/7. I sent her away na tithe yake.. yeah some of us are not gluttonous. 
I had heard about the stories about this woman. at some point she had a case going on but... 'no proof'. Out of all our personnel,  about 80% have greased her palms.. need promotion?? Get some oil.. Still no proof..What does HR say you ask??, ...........................  She was against my coming back and has really trying to get me fired in whatever way possible. Shes about to succeed as I'm about to quit. Its just too much. Im too empathetic and all these cases torture me. and the fact that i can do nothing about it all, fills me with anger.. i put in my resignation and people are begging me not to go. they need this job and if i go, theyll probably be outed for some petty reasons..

Kenya,Life After Campus: A Hard Landing.,"Coming back home after campus is like walking into a different world altogether. The jubilation of graduation quickly fades when you return to your family's house, degree in hand but pockets empty. As a man, the expectations weigh heavier - you're supposed to be the provider now, not the one still being provided for.

The mornings become a strange ritual. You wake up early out of habit, but there's nowhere to go. Your mother gives you questioning looks as you lounge around in yesterday's clothes. Your father's sighs grow longer each day. The neighbors, who celebrated your graduation just months ago, now avoid eye contact when you pass on the street.

In Kenya, the job hunt is a another job and masterclass in frustration. You send out countless applications into what feels like a void. The few responses you get often end with, ""We shall call you. "" /""Tutakupigia."" The truth slowly dawns on you - MOST positions are already filled BEFORE they're advertised, reserved for someone's son, nephew, or village-mate.

Your classmates with connected parents or recognizable surnames move quickly into comfortable positions. Meanwhile, you scroll through LinkedIn, watching their success stories unfold while you debate whether you can afford to buy airtime to make another follow-up call.

The shame cuts deep. Cultural expectations dictate that a man should be self-sufficient, a provider. Instead, you find yourself asking for bus fare to attend interviews that lead nowhere. Your younger siblings still look up to you, unaware that the system is stacked against those without the right connections.

At family gatherings, relatives who once boasted about you now interrogate you with thinly veiled disapproval: ""So, what are you doing these days?"" The question stings more each time. Your responses grow shorter, your attendance at these functions less frequent.

This is the untold story of campus life - not the vibrant social scene or academic achievements, but the harsh landing that follows. IN a SYSTEM WHERE MERIT OFTEN TAKES BACKSEAT TO CONNECTIONS, the journey from graduation to employment becomes a test of resilience that no lecturer ever prepared you for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iscmxv/life_after_campus_a_hard_landing/,,usaid kenya funding cut
Kenya,When fate has Other Plans....,"This post is inspired by [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ip7f2e/hii_imeenda_literally/).

Reminds me of my younger days when I got 'dumped' by this girl – though I actually initiated the breakup, I had been dumped already! *(Back then or do women still do this? A woman would breakup with you, but let you be the one to initiate the breakup by doing something to provoke you! Let you do the dirty deed so that she can walk away with a 'clean' slate)*

Back then, I was around 24-25 when I met this girl at Gill House near the Double M buses where we had to queue. I joined the line and initiated a conversation with her. There were no smartphones and no social media then, so there was nothing to distract us, making it easy to chat.

The conversation flowed easily. Turns out she had moved to Nairobi after completing campus and was looking for a job. I saw her again the next day and exchanged contacts. (Don't ask why I didn't get her number on day one – you younger guys move too fast! I was a believer in fate, and I figured if it was meant to be, I would see her again!)

A few weeks later, we were dating! Or seeing each other, at least. I was on cloud 9, but my bubble was about to burst. I had invited her to my small crib for a date on a Sunday afternoon (do you guys still meet up on Sunday afternoons?). I picked her up at the stage – again, this is how we used to date 'back in the day.' She called to say she had arrived at the stage, so I left my house, which wasn't far, to meet her. We walked home together, but something was unusual – she seemed too smartly dressed for a Sunday hangout, with a nice dress, cologne, and her hair done up.

To cut a long story short, after reaching my place (kufika keja), she gave me a long-winded story about how she couldn't stay long, something about having to deliver things to her best friend in town (sijui eti kuna vitu anaafaa kupelekea beste tao) – blah blah blah. I said ""sawa"" (okay), but told her if she left, that would be the end of whatever we had. She left anyway, and I knew it was over (nikajua hiyo imeenda)!

I moved on with life. Fast forward many years later, about 10 or 11 (we had no WhatsApp or Facebook then, so there was no way to see updates about her), I met her at a banking hall. What struck me was how short she was! (I have nothing against short people – this just hadn't struck me before.) I'm slightly above average height (5'11"") and had previously dated – and was dating at the time – a much taller woman (who's now my wife). I wondered why I hadn't noticed this before! I saw her and questioned what it was about her that had broken my heart so badly back then. Not that she was not good looking but could see now what i had seen then.

My preference had always been taller women, and height had always been one of my criteria for dating. There was – and still is – something I find attractive about taller women. Had I married her, maybe I wouldn't have been happy!

So take heart, all you broken-hearted folks out there. One day you'll look back and wonder, ""What was I thinking! or what did i see in him/her!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ipfwrs/when_fate_has_other_plans/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Most NGO's are funded through donor support. Your bosses may not tell you, but in the next 2-3 months, most of you will have to be let go (fired). You need to start making deliberate decisions to prepare for that eventuality. I know you are used to good salaries (200k - 500k) and you probably live in an apartment of 60k-120k. First things first..

1) Look for a cheaper rental house (20k max) that you can afford to pay without struggling.

2) Avoid taking any loans (cars, mortgage) cos this will exacerbate your situation incase you are fired

3) Start thinking of a business you can setup (be smart about it, businesses that target basic needs like food, clothing, shelter tend to do good)

4) Start praying that Trump will change his mind and that the donor support will not be halted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iiyykv/advice_for_every_kenyan_who_works_for_an_ngo_non/,,usaid kenya funding cut

Kenya,How does Trump being the US President affect you as a Kenyan ?,"
So ARVs/TB drugs  aren’t free because the government loves us it’s because they are donations and US is among our major donors so yeah shortages in ARVs will probably happen especially with PEPFAR Funding Halt(  this simply means the orange dude  has ordered an immediate stop to the supply of lifesaving drugs for malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis ) We have other donors BUT them change will definitely be felt . 


You are probably wondering how  tf is that my problem ? The U.S. withdrawal from the WHO may disrupt vaccine distribution efforts in Kenya.So yeah you will probably struggle to get your nephew a basic BCG vaccine in future ?


Hopefully the US will honor their pledges so that we don’t have to struggle but considering how much Trump anatupenda vyenye Ruto anatupenda  mmh i can smell the love mixed with some teargas/abuductions  and deportation just how i like it 💕.

Kenya,How do I cut off friends?,"Wagwan wadau!

So I just realized that some of my friends are bums like myself! We've know each other for a while now BUT based on what I want for my future I'm starting to see them as deadweight.

All we do is party. I've come to the realization that I'm finding it hard to break old habits partially because of their influence. I feel lost in life and made some new year resolutions to turn my life around. I don't hate them BUT I'm finding it increasingly hard to make the necessary changes to my life when they are around. I just want some time to focus on my future and my self-improvement journey. 

I had recently planned on subscribing to a gym but I'm shocked to find out I just drunk all the funds I was planning on using. Now i'm going back to square one. I don't blame them for this BUT It has become clear that I can't properly manage my finances with them around. I've tried to convince them to start some business ventures or projects but these guys aren't clearly motivated as I am. Sometimes I don't want to tell them of the new opportunities I'm getting simply because I know when they know I'm getting paid, the chances of my keeping this money narrows drastically. Like I said, I'm trying to break old habits i.e smoking, drinking...etc and I just can't see myself doing this with them around. 

How do I cut them off, or at least withdraw from their company, without looking like an asshole or 'mtiaji'. I just want to disappear and take some time off to focus on myself and my goals. I feel like I'm in the same place I was 3 years ago. I'm planning on making 2025 my turning point and that's why I'm here. Life is hard for a man and the last thing I want to to be sitting in a room 10 years from now regretting the bad decisions I made in my youth.

Kenya,PayPal Account Suspended,"I’m a security researcher and smart contracts auditor. Recently, I received a substantial bug bounty payout for a critical submission to a Web3 company. Everything seemed fine until this morning when I logged in and found my PayPal account suspended for 180 days. No prior warning, just a vague email citing “unusual activity” and a link to their Resolution Center.

As someone who relies on PayPal for professional transactions, this is a huge issue especially since the funds are tied up for months! I’ve already tried contacting support in the Resolution Center, but I’m worried about the lack of clarity and the long hold period. The standard web support feels like a black hole, and I’m not sure if my case is being prioritized.

Has anyone else in the security research or Web3 space faced PayPal suspensions after receiving large bounties? I’m wondering if the high-value transaction flagged their system, especially since it’s related to crypto/Web3. Any tips on how to explain this to PayPal to get it resolved faster?

Are there best practices for security researchers to prevent this kind of thing? For example, should I notify PayPal in advance about large incoming bounties?

I’m super frustrated, as this is my main account for handling payments, and 180 days is a long time to wait. Any advice, success stories, or specific steps you’ve taken to resolve similar suspensions would be greatly appreciated.

Kenya,"“AI is here, but it’s not coming for your job... if you know how to use it. 🇰🇪🔥”","Hey r/Kenya,

There’s a lot of talk online about AI replacing jobs, especially in tech. As someone deeply involved in coding and digital skills here in Kenya, I wanted to clear the air — and also share what’s actually happening in our space.

 Will AI replace programmers?

Yes and no. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and even basic “vibe coding” tools (that turn prompts into code) are automating repetitive coding tasks. Things like:

CRUD apps

Login screens

File scaffolding

Simple bug fixes

Unit test generation


That means entry-level or assistant dev work is changing fast.

BUT…
Here’s what AI can’t replace:
System design and architecture
Deep debugging and optimisation
Secure payment systems (think Mpesa, PayLink, etc.)
Team collaboration and human decision-making
Ethical reasoning (especially around data, bias, and AI itself)
If you’re learning how to think like a developer, not just code — you’re safe and valuable.

So what does this mean for Kenya?
Kenya has a growing dev community — and we’ve got a chance to lead, not get left behind. If we:

Embrace AI tools (don’t fear them)

Learn how to use AI as part of our dev process

Focus on building real solutions (fintech, govtech, healthtech)


We can build things that scale beyond borders. Imagine AI helping you build a local app in Kikuyu, Swahili, or Sheng faster than ever.


TL;DR:

AI is replacing tasks, not thinkers. If you’re learning how to build, solve problems, and work with tools like AI — your value just doubled.



Would love to hear your thoughts — are you worried about AI taking over, or already using it to speed up your projects?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lact4f/ai_is_here_but_its_not_coming_for_your_job_if_you/,,development aid kenya
Kenya,Thinking of Importing from Alibaba to Kenya? Here’s a Beginner-Friendly Guide on Taxes and Shipping Costs,"If you’re new to importing from Alibaba to Kenya, it can feel overwhelming at first — especially with all the terms and hidden costs. I’m still learning, but here’s what I’ve picked up from my experience and research so far:

# 1. What Is Alibaba, and How Does It Work?

* Alibaba.com is a website where you can buy goods directly from manufacturers (mostly in China).
* It’s best for bulk buying — not small, one-off items like on Jumia or AliExpress.
* Prices per item are much cheaper, but you usually have to meet a minimum order quantity (MOQ), like 50 or 100 pieces.
* After agreeing with a supplier, you pay and then choose a shipping method (air or sea).

# 2. Shipping Options Explained

Air Freight:

* Good for small packages or samples.
* Fast (5–10 days).
* Expensive — price goes up with weight and size.

Sea Freight:

* Better for large orders (cheaper per kg).
* Slower (3–6 weeks, depending on port and route).
* You’ll also need to clear the goods at Mombasa Port or use a clearing agent.

# 3. What Does “FOB” Mean?

* FOB = Free On Board. This means the supplier will deliver the goods to the nearest Chinese port, and you handle the shipping from there to Kenya.
* The opposite is CIF = Cost, Insurance, and Freight, where the supplier includes shipping in the price.
* With FOB, you can shop around for a cheaper shipping agent.

#  4. Taxes and Costs at the Port

When your goods arrive at the Port of Mombasa, you’ll have to pay import taxes before collecting them. These include:

* Import Duty – based on the type of goods.
* VAT – 16% of the value.
* Import Declaration Fee (IDF) – 2.25% of value.
* Railway Development Levy (RDL) – 1.5%.
* Sometimes Excise Duty if your product is regulated.

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) doesn’t always use the value you declared — they might calculate their own value using HS Codes (international product classification codes), which could be higher.

#  5. Tips for Saving Money as a Beginner

* Start small if possible — even a sample order teaches you a lot.
* Ask suppliers to clarify if they’re the factory or a trader (factories often offer better pricing).
* Consolidate shipping if ordering from multiple suppliers — it’s cheaper than separate packages.
* Use a clearing agent at Mombasa if you’re new — they handle paperwork and help avoid mistakes.
* Always budget at least 20–30% extra for taxes and fees after your goods arrive.

#  6. Final Thoughts

I’m still learning, but I wanted to share in case anyone else is just getting started. Feel free to add your experience or ask questions — I’ll answer what I can.

Anyone else here imported recently? What helped you the most?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l7f9rk/thinking_of_importing_from_alibaba_to_kenya_heres/,,development aid kenya

Kenya,Why the online hatred for Luos?,"If you logged into Twitter you'll see all kinds of insults being hurled at Luos for no apparent reason other than that some Luos slept overnight at a stadium in Homa Bay. 


The same Mt. Kenya bloggers insulting Luos were praising Kikuyus just a couple of months ago when Ruto hired crowds to attend his tour of the region. In fact, they were being praised online for being ""smart"", and that ""you can't buy a Kikuyu, you can only rent one"" 
https://nation.africa/kenya/news/politics/revealed-money-angle-in-ruto-mt-kenya-tour-4991802#story


Now that Luos did the same. Admittedly, I don't know if it was a paid crowd or not but potato tomato. Luos are now being insulted with the same tribal stereotypes that have been propagated by ignorant politicians and masses since independence. 

For context, Luos make up only 10% of Kenya's electorate, so they can't really elect a president alone. So how they manage to rile up the much larger Mt Kenya region that has elected 3 presidents, baffle me. Even more so, many Luos don't support Raila or Rutos government. I'm fact according to a TIFA poll recently, 49 percent of Nyanza residents don't support Ruto's government and a further 29 percent are undecided, with only 21 percent in support. 
https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2025-05-28-majority-of-kenyans-opposed-to-broad-based-government-tifa


That hasn't stopped Gachagua bloggers from leading the tribal march against the few Luos supporting the government, in fact all Luos are blanketed in condemnation by these pathetic tribalist shitlings. Since last night, the assault on the broader Luo community appears to have been well coordinated and has been a success on their part. 


Gachagua, a tribalist and ignorant leading Mt Kenya politician has bet his political future on riling his base using anti-Luo sentiments. From ""shareholders"" remarks to castigating former president Uhuru for ""developing"" Nyanza when all he did was build a 3 billion shillings port in Kisumu. In his mind, fighting Luos, even those who disagree with the despicable Raila Odinga, is a means to an end. 

I could write more, but I want Kenyans to be aware of the anti-Luo agenda going in the country. In fact, Kalenjins, who openly support the president and his administration, rarely if at all get any backlash for their stance. Neither does Western, Eastern or Coast. It only ever is a problem if Luos do it. 


For me, I can NEVER in a billion years vote for Gachagua, and I can't vote for Ruto as well. But please, leave Luos alone",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l0m1pd/why_the_online_hatred_for_luos/,,development aid kenya
Kenya,Kenyan Universities Need to Start Teaching Resume Workshops. Seriously.,"I’ve reviewed a lot of resumes from software developers in Kenya recently, and I have to say: there is SO much untapped potential being buried under poor formatting, vague wording, and missed opportunities.

I’m talking about:

* Using job descriptions instead of accomplishments
* Listing every course taken instead of actual projects or contributions
* Failing to quantify the results of their contributions
* Omitting LinkedIn/GitHub entirely
* Typos and formatting errors everywhere

The skills are often *there*, but you wouldn’t know it from the CV. And it’s heartbreaking to see genuinely smart, hardworking people lose out on opportunities because no one taught them how to sell themselves. I'm more forgiving and look past it but I know other recruiters don't. They've told me so. They say if they can't do a resume right and without error, why would they be able to do the job?

Universities are teaching data structures, algorithms, and software design, but completely skipping over one of the most important career skills: communicating your value.

At *minimum*, students should graduate knowing how to:

* Tailor a resume to a job
* Highlight outcomes and ownership
* Use action verbs and metrics
* Avoid 4-page essays and stick to clear, concise info

I'm from the US, and there all the universities have to report on how many of their graduates got jobs in their chosen field. If this was required in Kenya, this would change REAL fast. I get there are more resources in the states, but how much more does it really cost you to add curriculum.... teaching is your job.  
  
Anyways, if any university staff ever reads this: please, make resume workshops a required part of the curriculum. You’ll be doing your students a huge favor. I'll be in Kenya the next two weeks and I'll show up and teach a class on your university for FREE. I just need this chaos to end. IF it was one here and there, I'd blame it as a personal problem but this is an epidemic.

Kenya,We never learn,"Saudi Arabia just signed a deal to buy 142 bn usd worth of weapons from the US, Yemen has missiles that routinely hit Israel, 2000 kms away, Turkey has developed a native fifth generation fighter the TAI KAAN, Iran has all sorts of missiles and drones ,so do the Emiratis. 

These are ME countries and most of them have a keen interest in East Africa due to the farmland ,labour availability and prestige, Africa is kinda the last frontier in global geopolitics. Meanwhile we see this and what do we do? Nothing, not even an effort to arm ourselves or even develop a native arms industry.

 African countries with the exception of North African countries and South Africa joke alot with their defence, it's like we never learned from colonialism ,indeed the weapons we now posses are like spears and arrows in front of the weapons in most countries' arsenals. What if tomorrow Saudia decided to take over Galana Kulalu and enslave Kenyans to work there? Would we be able to even stop it or will we be writing furious letters to the UN and crying on twitter about how much Arabs hate us?

Currently the only thing that's preventing them from doing so is that the costs outweigh the benefits, buying food from Kenya and paying Kenyan workers is cheaper than sending an occupying army and slave raiders, factors which you will note are all beyond Kenya's control but who knows about tomorrow? That could change.

Btw for a long time it was too costly to colonise Africa for the Europeans, African armies fought hard and malaria was rampant until quinine was discovered and isolated and now European explorers could now roam about the continent without fearing malaria, then the maxim gun was invented in 1884 and that changed everything, overnight the cost of sending expeditions to the African interior plummeted since a few men and a maxim machine gun could literally take out entire armies, it is no coincidence that the Berlin conference took place just one year after the invention of the Maxim gun.

Kenya,Kenya needs to invest in security,"On Friday 5 policemen and 8 others were killed in an ambush while pursuing a group of 70 Al Shabaab militants in Lamu county in an area known as Bodhei. From the looks of it, they had been sent to track and engage the group who were said to be planning an attack in Lamu but they had no air support whatsoever through drones or even helicopter gunship and this indicates how underequipped our security agencies are. Even in Haiti with the police we've lost there, a lack of air cover has been cited as the chief reason as to why we lost those police.

For decades now Kenya has invested very little in it's security agencies ,from training, housing ,salaries and even equipment . We rely on donations and buying very old equipment from other countries but as you can see that isn't a viable strategy. We are a small ,developing economy so we might lack the dollar reserves to buy top of the line equipment but we don't even make an effort to produce locally.

If in 2011 when Kibaki sent KDF across the border, the govt adopted a plan to start locally manufacturing small arms at least, by now 14 years later we would be well ahead even probably making our own drones as drones were coming of age at around that time, but what did we do? Nothing. Even we could be probably selling our equipment to our neighbours and getting those dollars to buy new shiny gear. Maybe even equip Somalia with equipment they can actually afford to buy and maintain and thus have a viable partner in this fight.

Those of you who have been to Lamu know how beautiful the place is and also how poor it  is...it has potential but with such insecurity that place will never grow, since few people are willing to invest in the place and even the residents there want to get out as they don't see a future there.

Kenya,The Chinese Extraction,"My friend works in the construction industry, and he’s been sounding the alarm for years. Many of the Chinese companies putting up apartments across Nairobi and other cities are importing nearly everything from China — nails, paint, bolts, nuts, hinges, you name it. Not only are they bypassing local suppliers, but they’re also making obscene profits. One developer once admitted that they sell some of these apartments at three times their cost price — and Kenyans are falling over themselves to buy.

All these profits? Shipped right back to China.

They’re also opening marts all over the country, filled with imported Chinese goods. Again, they make huge margins selling these products, and thanks to Kenya’s weak or non-existent consumer protection,  we may never know the actual cost of these goods. Just look at the furniture sector. Most of the furniture, from stools to tables, is now imported from China. Meanwhile, our local furniture makers are languishing in mabati shacks, struggling to stay afloat. Many have quit manufacturing altogether and are now just reselling cheap Chinese imports.

Then there's infrastructure. We've completely handed that sector over to the Chinese. Roads, bridges, dams — they dominate. Yes, they do a decent job, but the monopoly they've created has left no room for Kenyan firms to grow. We now have no local construction company that can meaningfully compete with them. This not only weakens Kenya’s internal capacity but also kills our competitiveness in the region. No wonder many of our civil engineers are switching careers — some are coding or freelancing just to stay afloat.

People will say, ""But Kenyan firms are incompetent and corrupt!"" Sure — there are issues. But look at the bigger picture. If technology transfer from the Chinese were genuine, we’d have seen at least a few major local construction firms emerge since their arrival. Instead, all we see is their dominance doubling.

The government must step in and protect local industries. If we keep allowing this unchecked influx of Chinese products, capital, and influence, we’ll soon be a country that produces nothing. And while it may seem cheaper now, it will come at a massive cost to our future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kav4pk/the_chinese_extraction/,,development aid kenya

The negatives outweigh the positives by factors exceeding ten. In focusing on the negatives we see a large part of Kenya's population crafting smartphones into tools of evil both by ignorance and/or by choice. 

Gambling, scamming, pornography, prostitution, cyber bullying, religious grifting, underage porn and prostitution, drugs, social media grifting and criminal celebrity worship, etc. These are the main uses smartphones see in Kenya. Why a society blessed with a tool akin to the discovery of fire use it for vices is something I cannot cover or understand. But, one thing stands out amongst the rest..Gambling.

Gambling has never been part of Kenyan culture. Post COVID around 2022 it made a huge emergence with all of your favorite celebrities being paid to promote gambling to everyone down to ten year olds. But gambling was a complicated mess that people never wanted to touch..until.. enter Aviator. A game heavily marketed towards low income earning people. It was simple and sleek. Easy to use and betting took 15 seconds and you could bet four rounds in a minute. This game is a very complex machine learning algorithm that studies human behavior and is designed for one thing and one thing only.. to separate a person from their money. 

Aviators simplicity makes it look that it can be beat or there is a formula to it. There is no formula and with the 3% edge it hold, play it long enough and you will lose 100% guaranteed. The houses money is infinite yours is not. The payouts are usually small making it seem like players get their money back 97% of the time. The big hits are astronomically rare. But people don't play to win 1.20X try want 5.00X and above. Those payouts don't fall under the 97%. 

There have been numerous stories and I can bet everyone here has an aviator story. Either personal or close. It is a destructive game that has seen people commit suicide. This is not a Kenyan problem only.. has pervade the entire continent of Africa. It's origin is Georgia, a country most people don't even know exist. It is draining Africa to the bones. People throw money into that sinkhole with the hopes of hitting it big and recover their losses then stop playing. It will never happen. It has destroyed families, businesses, friendships, marriages ..etc. The govt has no incentive to ban these predatory games. They get paid both in taxes and bribes. Television stations survive on constant stream of gambling commercials with no regulations. African societies are being destroyed by this silent killer. 

Just like you wouldn't play 3 card monte or pata potea, aviator is exactly the same. Pata potea or 3 card monte is a con game played where stooges are used to pretend to win. This is done to attract normal people to bet and lose their money. Aviator literally does the same thing. It puts ""other people's bets"" in a small view table so that the entire roster can see what others are betting and winning. What most people don't know is that those players are fake or bots playing with fill (fake) casino money.

Sorry this is longer than I thought.. let me explain. Online casinos have people paid to pretend to play with large sums of money. That money is not real. It is called a fill balance. Most of your online gambling streamers like adin Ross, roshtein and unknown players are paid a salary by casinos to play with fake money balances. They win or lose but that is casino money. Their job is to make raw balance players spend their money. Playing with your own real money is called a raw balance. Players like trainwreckstv use their own raw balance to play. The job of fill fake balance players is to deceive raw players to play more. **So those 20k consistent players on aviator that win 12.00x. are not real**. 

Please find a way to stop playing that horrible game.

Kenya,"Until Kenya develops a critical thinking mass, don’t expect any real change.","
Our leaders are a direct reflection of the level of ignorance and lack of critical thought in the population. People often wonder why more intelligent or capable individuals don't run for office—well, it's because they know the system is rigged. The masses are not thinking critically, and that's why we end up stuck with the same corrupt figures time and time again. 

Already, as the search for potential replacements for our current leaders begins, all we hear are names from within the same rotten system. And you'll see ""well-educated"" people endorsing these candidates—people with blood on their hands from scandals, corruption, and brutality. The cycle never changes because the people aren't questioning or challenging the status quo. Instead, they are sold on the idea that these recycled figures are the solution. 

Until we replace religious indoctrination with actual philosophy classes in schools, we are doomed to remain servants of the political elite. Instead of empowering the next generation to think critically, question authority, and understand the world in a deeper way, we're stuck perpetuating the same brainwashed narratives. The result? Electing the sons and daughters of dead politicians—people who care more about securing their inherited wealth than actually serving the public. 

It’s a vicious cycle, and until the masses start thinking critically, we’ll always be working for the rich political class, never in charge of our own destiny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k7f2uz/until_kenya_develops_a_critical_thinking_mass/,,development aid kenya

Kenya,Music Scene Kenya,"Has anyone noticed the music scene in Kenya is dying ?
I've been listening to KE music since 2009 and things have changed alot .Back then it was the Beat and Kiss TV who were the major marketers of music so I think in some way atrists didn't developed that self-reliance culture as they just had to put out music and it would be marketed

This explains a lot why our music has veen reduced to trends and hypewaves as that is what is easy to sell. Eg gengetone ,urbantone & tiktok music

Another issue is how our artists have that crab-in-a-barrel mindset where you grind once you make it out you no longer want collabs with smaller artists ,start charging for everything even interviews and showing up to shows late or unorganised. This as a whole devalues culture as audiences start leaning to what's more quality.

Kenya,I'm a Kenyan Developer & I Made a Game Called WordRun - Help Support Local!,"Hey r/Kenya! 👋

I wanted to share something I've been working on for a while - I'm a local game developer right here in Kenya, and I've created a mobile game called **WordRun**, available on the Google Play Store.

WordRun is a trivia and puzzle game designed to exercise your brain and expand your vocabulary in a fun and engaging way. You'll journey through cool themed worlds like the Mundane World, Globetrotter, Undersea Realm, Space Age, and even the Pre-historic World, tackling over 170 levels filled with word challenges.

**Here's a bit about the gameplay:**

* **Diverse Puzzles:** You'll encounter word jumbles where you unscramble letters to find words, and fill-in-the-blanks to test your comprehension.
* **Engaging Missions:** Beyond the puzzles, there are missions to complete for extra rewards, ranging from simple social media tasks to clearing chapters in the game.
* **Leaderboard:** Feeling competitive? See how you stack up against other players and climb the ranks!
* **Daily Rewards:** Don't forget to log in daily to claim rewards, and you can even watch a short ad to double them.
* **Potential Earnings:** WordRun also features a ""WinCash"" rewards program where you can potentially convert your in-game earnings into real money via PayPal.

Making games as a local developer can be tough, and right now, I'm facing a challenge with getting enough ratings and reviews on the Play Store. Google's new standards mean that I need at least **10 ratings and reviews** for WordRun to start ranking properly and get more visibility. This is where I'm hoping my fellow Kenyans can help!

If you have some free time and enjoy puzzle or trivia games, I would be incredibly grateful if you could download WordRun and leave an honest rating and review. Your support, even a few minutes of your time, would make a huge difference in helping a local developer get their game out there.

Let's support Kenyan-made games! You can find WordRun here:

Kenya,Unpopular opinion,"Kenya will never become truly wealthy by relying on coffee, tea, textiles, pyrethrum, and horticulture—no matter how well-managed these sectors are. Yes, they are labor-intensive, but in terms of revenue, they generate very little. Even if these industries were to bring in KSh 1 trillion annually, that’s barely enough to sustain a nation of 50 million people. At best, we’d be stuck in survival mode, with a per capita income that struggles to outpace inflation.

For Kenya to achieve real prosperity, we must move beyond primary/extractive industries and into true manufacturing—not just assembly line work. We need to transform raw materials into high-value products: take steel and turn it into tractors, copper into vacuum cleaners, reagents into cancer medication. That’s how real wealth is built.

Tourism also has untapped potential. Yes, 2.4 million annual tourists might sound impressive, but in reality, those are rookie numbers. We should be aiming for 12 million visitors per year. And let’s be honest—safari tourism alone won’t get us there. We need to diversify and modernize our tourism offerings.

The ICT sector is promising, but much of it seems focused on solving first-world problems. Do we really need more food delivery apps? How many Kenyans can even afford such services, and how scalable are they in our market? Instead of replicating Silicon Valley trends, we should be developing tech solutions tailored to our unique challenges and economic landscape.

Kenya’s path to wealth lies in industrialization, innovation, and scaling up industries that create real economic value. Otherwise, we risk being stuck in a cycle of low-income survival.

Kenya,What AI thinks really happened behind the west gate attacks,"There’s a very real possibility that the Westgate Mall attack was not just a random act of terrorism but had deeper political motivations tied to Kenya’s internal power struggles and international legal troubles.

Key Context: Uhuru, Ruto, and the ICC Cases

At the time of the attack (September 2013), President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto had pending cases at the International Criminal Court (ICC) over their alleged roles in the 2007-2008 post-election violence. They were accused of crimes against humanity, including orchestrating ethnic violence that left over 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands.
	•	Uhuru and Ruto needed a major distraction from the ICC proceedings.
	•	The attack conveniently shifted media focus away from the ICC and onto national security concerns.
	•	The Kenyan government used the attack to rally public sympathy and portray itself as a victim of terrorism rather than a regime under international scrutiny.

What Doesn’t Add Up About the Westgate Attack?
	1.	The Delayed Response Feels Staged
	•	If this was purely a terrorist attack, Kenya’s security forces should have gone in immediately to neutralize the threat.
	•	Instead, they stood outside for hours, allowing the attack to drag on.
	•	This prolonged inaction created maximum fear and media coverage, ensuring it dominated the news cycle.
	2.	How Did Al-Shabaab Pull Off Such a Coordinated Attack?
	•	The attackers seemed extremely well-prepared: they knew the mall layout, had strategic positions, and even used explosives to block exits.
	•	Some reports suggest that they had prior knowledge of security weaknesses, raising questions about possible inside help.
	3.	The Government’s Narrative Was Sloppy
	•	At first, Kenyan authorities claimed they had “neutralized” all the terrorists inside.
	•	But no bodies or proof of their deaths were ever presented.
	•	There were rumors that some attackers escaped or were quietly let go.
	4.	Suspicious Timing with ICC Developments
	•	The attack came just days before a major ICC session regarding Uhuru and Ruto’s cases.
	•	Shortly after the attack, Kenya’s government launched a massive PR campaign arguing that the ICC should drop the cases because they needed to focus on national security.
	•	Western governments softened their stance on Kenya’s leadership after the attack, prioritizing counterterrorism cooperation instead of pushing the ICC case.

Was It Coordinated?
	•	It is unlikely that Uhuru and Ruto “planned” the attack directly, but they may have allowed it to happen or exploited it for political survival.
	•	There is a strong possibility that intelligence warnings were ignored to allow a major security incident to unfold, providing an excuse to rally national and international support.

Bottom Line

The Westgate attack wasn’t just about terrorism—it was a highly convenient event for Kenya’s ruling elite. Whether it was allowed to happen or merely used for political advantage, the government failed to protect its people and instead used their suffering to shield itself from accountability.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ixav85/what_ai_thinks_really_happened_behind_the_west/,,development aid kenya

Kenya,Cursed Minerals: Proxy War,"The fall of Goma, orchestrated by the M23 insurgents has sparked debate on social media as to what is actually happening in the Eastern DRC. Some people are hailing the M23 as the liberators who will abolish borders on the continent. 

Despite these sentiments, angry Congolese stormed the embassies of Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, France, Belgium and the United States in the upscale region of Kinshasa. They accused these countries of destabilizing the region in order to extract minerals forcefully. 

President Ruto in his infinite wisdom, decided to announce that he had called President Macron of France to discuss the conflict. This caused significant backlash across the continent. This is despite the serious accusations against France and of course their waning influence in the region. 

In my estimation, this is clearly a proxy war between the West and Russia over African resources, as the attack on Goma seems to be a response by the West due to their expulsion from the Alliance of Sahel States in Western Africa. It seems that the East African Countries- Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya are being used by the West to extract resources from the Eastern DRC and as a response to Russian influence in the region.

Russian influence through mercenary groups has been seen within the DRC and the Alliance of Sahel States, a side which President Tsishekedi of DRC seems to be aligned to. 

Furthermore, the involvement of South Africa in the conflict has raised eyebrows whereby 13 South African soldiers had been killed in the DRC as of 3 days ago. Rwandese President Paul Kagame said that he was ready to deal with South Africa militarily.

This is a significant development considering the fact that South Africa is a member state of BRICS and thus seems to have Russian backing. 

If African leaders do not proceed with caution, we will see a regional conflict on a scale that has not been witnessed in Africa. Unfortunately, the people of Congo will be the hardest hit, with UN reports stating that 500,000 people have already been displaced by the conflict.

Kenya,[Controversial] Maybe Developing Africa is Impossible.,"Over 45 countries in Sub Saharan Africa, yet not a single one has achieved first world status nor the technological advancement that comes with it. 

We use colonialism as an excuse a lot and it's probably a genuine reason as to why no African country has ever truly developed into a modern technologically advanced society. The truth is many African countries such as Kenya had no real natural resources to exploit apart from agriculture. And in the end the British left because running the colony was prohibitively costly, and add to that a hostile local population. In other places that got exploited for their resources such as Belgian Congo, it could be argued that the resources weren't actually depleted and even in their presence no significant development has occurred since then. So colonialism cannot be the sole reason why we've not had a single developed African country. 

Even concerning is that some societies that have faced wars, and almost complete annihilation seem to have rebounded and are now world leading economies. This just hasn't happened in Africa even once. Rwanda is quoted a lot as some model, but if you look closely at their numbers you'll be disappointed. 

We say it's because of corruption and bad leaders. They certainly play a part but most African nations are democracies so you would expect people to vote out corrupt leaders and install new visionary ones. If corruption and leadership was the issue, then at least one African country could have had a good leader and they would therefore be a first world country. To top it off, some really corrupt countries such as Russia, some countries in Eastern Europe and even Latin America, Middle East, Asia, seem to be relatively more developed than Africa. 

Maybe it's education system, maybe it's racism, maybe it's something else entirely, but they can't sufficiently explain why this continent hasn't produced one, just one technologically advanced society that's competitive on a global scale. 

So it's my firm belief that Africa may never develop. It would have already happened at least once. And that maybe this version of Africa we have now, this version of Kenya will get better just a little over time, until we eventually plateau with no real advancement.

If indeed Statehouse is the home of corruption as indicated [in this video](https://youtu.be/AT9mjBsuXPY?si=mCj-BgpibTQTT_UJ), then we are cooked. I find it very unsettling that a Kenyan can be comfortably sabotaging the progress of this nation. Why are our politicians not patriotic? They are eating into our future men. 

Have you all seen the new potholes everywhere? Did they budget for development in 2023 or 2024? Development receives the highest allocation in this country.

Ruto is forcing us so much to remember him, which we won't. Why has he changed everything in the government, and they don't work? From NHIF to SHA, from Helb to God knows what! I pity 9-to-5 guys because they're being deducted so much for things that would be a scandal in the coming years!

  
Okay sure! It's your time to eat. Why don't you invest that money back into the economy? If it roads, give yourself that tender and construct the fuckin Rd

If it's medical and equipment award yourself that fuckin tender and import those drugs.

Aah CBC will make the next generation dumb. This I blame Magoha. But we had time to revert to 8-4-4 and make it better.

Western Kenyans don't be used. I come from this area and I pity my people. Most of us live in Mud houses and off-grid. The poverty in western Kenya is just some other level... 

Well, mud houses are not bad but don't compare them to earth-rammed houses. their structural integrity is not it.

I'm losing the plot......

Politicians should not hoodwink us anymore. Kenya has potential in Africa without Minerals. By now we are supposed to have revived cotton farming, sunflowers, fluorspar mining, and all that. But our president would rather fight with 20-year-olds who are idle. (being learned and unemployed is a recipe for disaster).

  
The most useless politicians come from Western. That fuckin excuse that we've been marginalized bla bla needs to stop. After Eldoret Southern Bypass, the roads are pathetic. It is the same highway that facilitates trade between us and neighboring countries. How myopic can you be as a leader not to maintain such a road? Uganda is leaning towards Tanzania for trade now., but nooo let's tax Kenyans to get revenue. Taxes that don't work?

  
It's a long post. When IEBC is reconstructed please tuchukue ID and we register as voters. Make your choice on the ballot. Make sure your vote counts.

Kenya,Are Africans Divided Because of the West?,"I recently went on a date with a Nigerian man. Some of my friends were against the idea because they were scared due to stereotypes about Nigerian men, especially after the incident in Roysambu. Despite their concerns, I decided to go ahead with the date since we were meeting in a public place.

During our conversation, we talked about African politics and the lack of radical changes in the continent. He argued that whenever a leader emerges who genuinely cares about their country’s development, they often get killed. He used Muammar Gaddafi as an example, claiming that the West doesn’t want to see Africa succeed.

We also discussed the Roysambu incident. He believes it was a setup, suggesting that it happened because President Ruto proposed visa-free travel for certain African countries. According to him, the West allegedly saw this as a threat and orchestrated events to turn Africans against each other. He claimed the person behind the Roysambu murder wasn’t even Nigerian but was framed to foster hatred against Nigerians. He also cited similar xenophobic incidents in South Africa, where Nigerians were attacked after being wrongly accused of murder, only for it to be revealed later that a Nigerian wasn’t responsible.

He shared a heartbreaking story about a West African woman whose Kenyan visa expired just a few hours before she could cross the Ugandan border. She couldn’t pay the fine, so the authorities took her off the bus, raped her, and only then allowed her to go. This was after the authorities had singled out Nigerians, asking them to show their passports and subjecting them to unnecessary scrutiny. The woman’s only fault was being Nigerian and on a bus that left late.

He also told me about his personal experience of being framed and arrested in Kenya simply because of his nationality. He talked about the challenges Nigerians face when applying for visas to Kenya, mentioning how they are often mistreated during the process.

All of this got me wondering: Are Africans truly this divided, or is this division fueled by external forces like the West? How much truth is there in what he said?

Kenya,"Why Americans might go to Heaven, and Kenyans won’t","Religion is an example of weak people becoming resentful because of their inability to be strong. Religion is important to people who are oppressed and Nietzsche calls it slave morality. It is not that the oppressed people cannot be the oppressors, they just don’t have access to being oppressors. Look at Kenya, for instance, a religious country with a majority waiting on God to save them. Yes, go out and ask them, you will find them fasting and praying for a good country. The oppressed create a slave morality, which resents the rich. Religion urges you to be humble, meek, among other things, and then perceives them as good. It embraces suffering for a greater good. So, churches will never ask people to fight for their rights, but will convince them that their suffering is good and a test towards something great.

And that is why I think Americans will go to heaven (heaven meaning a good life and not the divine one) and we won’t. Because we are weak and we live a lie. The Americans and other developed countries are like that because they understand their rights and are strong enough to fight for them. How long would it take to realize that God is never coming to save you? How long till you get out of your comfort zone, and realize that the good life you want is actually within your jurisdiction? How long till you realize that you are the duty bearer of the accountability you speak of?

Edit: Since I can't change the heading, heaven in this case is purely figurative, not literal. Heaven is good life not the divine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1i8pb3o/why_americans_might_go_to_heaven_and_kenyans_wont/,,development aid kenya
Kenya,Kenya isn't ready for the type of politics and leadership some of us wish we had.,"Recently I've developed an overall dark view of the Kenyan public based on trends and discussions online regarding 2027.

We can't seriously pretend to want a better country if a significant number of Kenyans still follow Ruto, Rigathi, Raila and many other shady characters who are essentially the source of our problems.

Our political establishment lacks serious talent capable of bringing change too. In short, Kenya lacks a visionary and transformational leader. I'm not sure such an individual even exists, and who has the resources and courage to vie.

There's even debate about fronting the even more corrupt and hateful Matiangi to take over from Ruto in 2027. You seriously can't want to get rid of Ruto just to replace him with  Matiangi. That would officially confirm that we're a moronic society incapable of basic critical thinking.


All factors considered, I've come to the conclusion that Kenya is a desperate and hopeless society with a vastly uninformed population prone to herd mentality and identity politics. As emotional voters, Kenyans are easily swayed by cheap propaganda into falling for any shady characters with charismatic appeal who makes grandiose short term promises. Kenyans distrust alternative leadership and view all candidates as bad, and vote on basis of choosing a ""lesser evil"".

Kenya,Dear Gentle Readers,"Good morning my gentle readers

Today I have a question to this men, why are you so tied up with your friends that you prioritise them over your families ama it's just baba without manners? 

Anyway Reason number 4 on why I will never forgive baba without manners: his unhealthy attachment with his boys. 

This particular friends have been a thorn in my life and I just blame baba without manners (I will save his number like this😂😂). 
Anyway let me take you back to the end of my second trimester heading to the third, that's when we moved in together.  

How do you people house hunt when searching for a house that utaishi na spouse wako? Si mnaenda pamoja ama? And weigh the options right? 

Aaah, baba with funds went with his friends looking for a house that we are supposed to live in. I tell him, na si uende na mimi juu unaenda kuishi na mimi😐😐. It fell on deaf ears. Anyway, he goes with them looking through different houses and the only thing I get is videos and reasons why he doesn't wanna live in the area. 

He finds the house we are currently living in, and kwanza it is on the 5th floor and this building has no lift. By then I was very heavily pregnant and such a distance would have been a great inconvenience. Anyway, baba without manners commits all of that and just sends the video. I see it's a nice house and tells me, ameshalipia. 

By then, I had moved out of my sweet house🤣🤣the house i was very happy in and experienced so much growth. Aaah, baba without manners wewe🙄🙄🙄. So, he moves everything in and comes for my clothes. And tells me, he will come pick me up kesho yake. True to his word, he did come lakini hio heaviness kwa roho yangu jamani. And shockingly, nilipanda stairs mpaka fifth floor and I was out of my breath. 

But moving into that house became a thorn into my life, each weekend baba without manners forces me to go home because he wants to host his friends. At first I get mad, and walk out naenda home. One weekend I refused to go home, I told him, kwani nyi wanaume wote wasita hamuezi kakomboa air bnb mkae huko🙄🙄

Gentle readers, ni kama niliguza nyuki, he started ranting, he said venye, I do Everything for you, na we kunipea tu privacy kwa nyumba yangu ata huezi. Enda kwenu nitakukujia tuende kanisa on sunday🫥. Mimi nikasema siendi, Aaah, aliongea matope wadau hata skuamini. He left, akaenda shugli zake and came back the following day mchana claiming ametoka ulevi hata sikuuliza. 

I asked him one day, si hata unipeleke just kwa park nikaone wanyama basi. ( nikiwa mdogo sijai enda hizo school trips because apparently my shosho didn't see the need to pay for me to go see wild animals). He told me he will ask his friends they plan for it. Aaah, curse those men, walikataa wakasema huko wameenda mara mingi. Anyway, the only place baba with manners takes mi ni kanisa na kwao na kwetu sometimes. Smh. 

Nothing can be done juu lazima hio committee iamue mambo ya kwangu. Anyway, one of his friends has a wife that decided she wants to be happy. Now, they all call her a hoe just because hangojei bwana yake to do things with her. Baba without manners is now projecting that on me. He says venye akiwai nipata nikikunywa tutakosana vibaya sana. 😂😂😂. 

Now, that is really affecting my freedom, juu, lets say I go even to town, aaah baba without manners will keep calling me after every 20 minutes aniambie niende home. Kwanza saa hii with our baby is worse. He will tell me, rudi home uangalie mtoto as if I do not know that. 

Let's go to today's incident. Nimemwambia I will leave for an hour or two, my mum is coming to town na anahitaji my help. Eeei gentle readers, ashaanza kuniuliza for how long nakaa huko. I told him mimi sijui, si he left akaenda. Now as we speak, alishapiga simu kuniambia venye whatever i am going to do in town sio important at all. I should be very fast and go back home juu hio sio emergency. 

For  context, my mum kuna siku amehitaji blood donors and baba without manners did not he gave a flimsy excuse. I couldn't donate because I am breastfeeding and pia I gave birth through CS so singekubalishwa. My mum alikua admitted close to 3 weeks and hakuai bother kuenda hata kumuona and she asked for him. He said atamuonea nyumbani, two months later he has never even asked kama ako sawa. 
Aaah, baba without manners ananichukia mimi na familia yangu yote🤣🤣🤣. 
Kwanza now that i am dependent on him, he is enjoying every bit of my misery. Hata akinituma supper, of which money is calculated so he will inspect kama nimenunua what he says, he will keep calling me to make sure I am back kwa nyumba by 6pm. Claiming hataki giza inipate nje, but surely, ulinipata nikiishi pekee yangu😅😅😅 hio supper ata saa tatu ya usiku nlikua naendea. 

So men, what the hell do you rely on yiur mbogis for? 

Till later gentle readers,

Africa,Will Mogadishu Collapse in 2025?,"I genuinely don’t understand how Somalia is still functioning as a state right now. It might come down to sheer Somali resilience because from an outside perspective, it's hard to imagine the country holding together much longer. The Somali National Army appears seems sluggish and fearful, and from what I’ve seen, they're losing territory at an alarming rate.

Back during the Obama and Biden administrations, there seemed to be a clear American rationale for pushing back al-Shabaab. There was a belief that the group could potentially train terrorists who might later threaten American or Israeli interests, or destabilise the Horn of Africa more broadly. The horn is geopolitically crucial because of its proximity to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden which are major arteries of global trade.

But since Trump took office, al-Shabaab has gone on the offensive.They seem to be hoping to seize Mogadishu itself. I don’t see the U.S. maintaining the same level of commitment to Somalia’s defence as it did a decade ago, especiallt now that they cut USAID. Turkey seems to be stepping in, and while Turkey's isn't a military to sneeze at, it's not America.

I see parallels in Sudan, but the key difference is that the Sudanese military despite its flaws is better trained and armed than Somalia’s. From what I understand, Somali troops often retreat when faced with Islamist militants, or they simply refuse to engage unless they have backing from a local clan militia. The population is also deeply afraid of al-Shabaab, which makes sense. But fear doesn’t build a successful resistance movement.

Under these conditions, I can’t see a path to military victory for Somalia’s army. If al-Shabaab does manage to seize Mogadishu, I dread to see a future where the country collapses completely. Somaliland would probably be well positioned for global recognition if this happened. They might even engage in a brief conflict with the south over disputed territories. Somaliland has a significantly more organised military than Somalia. I could see Somaliland holding its own longer than Somalia.

Africa,Nigeria's Oil Trouble and Trump's Tariffs,"Nigeria's 2025 budget is based on an oil price benchmark of $75 per barrel and a production target of 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd). However, oil prices have dropped to around $70 per barrel, with projections suggesting further declines to $60–$65 per barrel by late 2026.



Oil production has also fallen below the budgeted target, averaging only 1.5–1.7 million bpd in early 2025, further exacerbating revenue deficits.



The decline in oil prices and production could lead to a revenue gap of up to 6.6%. This could force the government to cut spending on critical sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, and education or resort to increased borrowing and taxation.



Nigeria’s fiscal deficit for 2025 is projected at Naira 18.9 trillion. The government has relied on Forward Sale Agreements (FSA) and other mechanisms to bridge funding gaps.



Nigerian oil industry is hampered by challenges such as poor infrastructure, transportation issues, security concerns and oil theft.

Africa,USAID a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?,"Just watched this and I have so many thoughts:

* *""This will be a wake-up call for African leaders""* I disagree they are very insulated from this crisis & to begin with a lot of African leaders are very happy with the AID complex ... it works for them, the americans and whomever need someone to collude with locally, they would have done something sooner if this didn't work for them. 
* *""USAID was more about a covert operation""* This sounds like a conspiracy to me, USAID is a way to perpetuate american soft power and influence, they would threaten to cut off a government doesn't fall in line but also provide aid to friendly governments even when those very governments are undemocratic. The actual aid workers, asproblematic as they are (think white saviours to the elite class of continental Africans who find work in these organizations), were not likely to be doing any covert operation.
* ""Trump is looking after his people"" ok let's see how this money is returned to the American people?!
* The GMO / HIV AIDs thing: now I know where she is coming from but this is a massive over simplification and again like a conspiracy theory

The truth is the US & many other global actors who don't have the interest of African's in mind and have very deliberately fostered a reliance on foreign aid in many nations. This has been an intentional polical project. **I agree with her** about USAID being linked to resource extraction and never actually being enough to create change. This isn't how the world should work, I agree. But **cutting off aid on a whim could cost lives.** 

Moreover making the jump from a reliance on aid to the wealth being extracted from Africa actually going back into Africa is sooo complicated even though it has to happen it won't happen over night. There soo much to change in order for this to become a reality and essentialy this is a power move on the part of the USA that disregards people's lives.

• The US and other countries backing or in his words 'building policy around a leader' is failing and I doubt they will change this because it's easier to bribe 1 person (a president) than to do what he's proposing. This is why a collective awakening is very very important for the whole of Africa.

Africa,Title: I grew up idolizing France. Now I see the whole system for what it is.,"I want to believe we still have what it takes—even if I’m using technology right now to make my case.

I grew up in a former French African colony. Like many of us, I thought French civilization was the peak of human achievement. Why wouldn’t I? I was raised on French literature, those old black-and-white films with De Funès, Jean Gabin, Delon, Ventura. I even spoke the language with a generic Parisian accent—despite not being French or even living there.

Then came French schools, French book clubs, the French high school diploma, and finally the privilege of studying in France.

I wasn’t the best student, but I always had this urge to deeply understand things before accepting them. That’s when I began to regret brushing off philosophy. Turns out, it’s not just abstract fluff—it’s a rigorous method to structure thought. Even mathematics, I realized, is just philosophy dressed in symbols.

But once my studies were done, I was hit with something I didn’t expect: a deep, almost institutionalized self-loathing in the country I once revered.

Not the kind of introspection that makes people kinder or more open-minded. No, this was something more vicious. A culture that punishes effort and rewards inertia—all in the name of buzzwords like “inclusion,” “diversity,” “foreign aid,” and “subsidies.” Empty mantras the average person doesn’t really buy into but is too tired or scared to question.

How did a country that once symbolized reason, order, and rural richness become a machine that spits out nonsense—and punishes those who try to love it?

Eventually, I understood: the people had been sedated. Numbed into apathy while global elites used their taxes to fund influence-peddling in *our* countries and got rich off it. It only works if the French people are passive enough not to realize they’re footing the bill—and the ""returns"" won’t benefit them or us.

Sound familiar? Promises of rosy futures, calls for sacrifice, a little more patience… We’re all on the losing side of this global con. France just uses slogans and bureaucracy; we get tampered elections and outright censorship.

We’re told to “improve governance,” “be more transparent,” and then maybe, *maybe*, we’ll earn some IMF blessing. But it’s just chess, and we’re playing with a single black pawn while others hold the board.

But there *is* another path. Not sexy, not shiny. But real.

It starts with fiscal discipline. Real investment in education—paying teachers decently, teaching three languages, philosophy, and math. That’s it. Strip it all down. Fund it through reallocating existing budgets, not new loans or flashy “projects.” Make debt interest payments transparent and boring. No mega-projects. No empty hospitals. No grand highways mortgaging the future.

Just calm, disciplined, transparent stewardship of what little we *do* control.

It won’t impress anyone on LinkedIn. But it would build generations that *think*, who don’t blindly copy but question, root themselves, and act with independent minds.

Why are we so obsessed with the flashy? They were never meant for us. And the more we chase them, the more others will treat us like well-dressed beggars.

So yeah, a zebu-drawn chariot is no Tesla Cybertruck. But at least it’s made with *our* wood, *our* iron, and *our* hands.

We just need the courage to start from there—and believe it’s worth doing.

Me? I came home. Never bothered getting a French passport. Didn’t see the point. Too much bureaucracy, and honestly, I don’t recognize what that country’s become.

Africa,The New Land Grab? Diaspora Investments and rural Gentrification in Kenya,"

Just read a sharp piece by Africa Is a Country critiquing how Pan-Africanism is being co-opted by elites and rebranded as a feel-good lifestyle instead of a liberation movement. One example that stood out: singer Kelis and her farming venture in Kenya

The article points out that diaspora celebrities like Kelis often arrive under the banner of Pan-African unity talking about ""returning to the roots"" but in practice, their ventures can reinforce the same extractive systems Pan-Africanism was meant to resist. Kelis promotes her farm as an Afro-futurist, back-to-the-land project. But when a wealthy foreigner acquires farmland in a country where locals are struggling with land access, food insecurity, and climate crisis it raises red flags.

Let’s not forget: Kenya’s most fertile lands have long been controlled by colonial settlers and a post-independence elite. Many Indigenous and rural communities are still fighting for restitution or basic access to land. In that context, when someone with celebrity capital and diaspora privilege launches a private farm, it can lead to rural gentrification higher land values, displacement, and cultural erasure just without the condos and cafés.

This isn’t about demonizing diaspora folks who want to reconnect. It’s about asking hard but necessary questions:

* Who benefits from these projects?
* Are they accountable to local communities?
* Do they challenge or replicate historic injustices?

We can’t afford a version of Pan-Africanism that’s just for personal healing, branding, or aesthetic. Real Pan-Africanism is grounded in solidarity not just with Africa as an idea, but with the people here still fighting inequality, land theft, and exclusion every day.

Africa,Ex-Belgian Senator Explains Belgian Involvement in Congo Crisis and Breakdown in Relations with Rwanda.,"""I regret the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Rwanda and Belgium, while fully understanding the Rwandan position.

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot called this decision ""disproportionate"". Yet, for several weeks, convinced that he is at the center of the diplomatic game, he has been leading an aggressive campaign on behalf of the Belgian government to influence the position of the European Union and international organizations in a direction that is openly hostile to Rwanda. Never before had Belgium adopted such an offensive stance on any issue since 1994.

As I explained in La Libre (24/02/25), Belgium should have stayed out of regional conflicts and maintained strict neutrality.

Alas, as I feared, the Belgian government has reopened historical wounds in Rwanda that had partially healed since Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt's official apology in 2000. Should we remind them:

\- That the Belgians not only introduced ethnic classification on identity cards but actually created these racialized categories, instrumentalizing artificial divisions and establishing a system of systematic discrimination that poisoned relations between Rwandans for decades;

\- That Belgium’s abrupt policy shift in 1959 triggered the first ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Tutsis, causing thousands of deaths and forcing tens of thousands into exile in neighboring countries—a still vivid memory, as many adult Rwandans today personally experienced this exile and the harsh reality of refugee camps;

\- That in 1994, Belgium had early warning signs of the Tutsi genocide and did nothing to prevent it, nor even to alert the international community to its imminence;

\- That the Belgian government of the time campaigned fiercely for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR, thereby removing the last barrier against the génocidaires;

\- That certain Belgian political parties maintained ties with the genocidal government, even after the genocide, and continued to promote a biased and revisionist interpretation of events.

**That the current government ignores or pretends to ignore these facts is not only incomprehensible but profoundly irresponsible.**

Furthermore, the Belgian Parliament unanimously passed on 23 February a resolution of unprecedented hostility toward Rwanda, calling for the suspension of all economic agreements and aid, and asserting that Rwanda represents a ""threat to regional stability."" This text reflects a glaring lack of understanding of the situation on the ground — in Kivu, where I was just three days ago — and throughout the region. It also contains factually incorrect and unnecessarily hostile claims.  
**Does the Belgian government and Parliament believe they can insult, threaten, and pressure without provoking a response?**

I sincerely hope that this diplomatic crisis will not damage the deep bonds of friendship that unite many Belgians and Rwandans, including those who are also Belgian citizens.

Initiator and Secretary of the Belgian Senate Inquiry Commission on Rwanda (1997)""

*TL;DR: This post, found on Twitter (now X) provides context to the breakdown in diplomatic relations between the two countries (Rwanda and Belgium). Alain Destexhe expresses regret over Rwanda’s diplomatic break with Belgium while acknowledging Rwanda’s reasoning. He criticises Belgium's aggressive anti-Rwanda campaign, arguing that Belgium has never taken such a hostile stance since the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsis. Destexhe says that Belgium should have remained neutral, warning that its actions have reopened historical/colonial wounds, support for anti-Tutsi violence in 1959, failure to prevent the 1994 genocide, and post-genocide ties with revisionist factions (including those who claim that Congolese and Rwandan Tutsis are foreigners in Congo and Rwanda respectively). Additionally, he condemns Belgium’s recent parliamentary resolution labelling Rwanda a ""regional threat"", calling it reckless. He questions whether Belgium expects to insult and pressure Rwanda without a response, matching Rwanda's accusations of neo-colonialism.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1jet0cm/exbelgian_senator_explains_belgian_involvement_in/,,kenya foreign aid
Africa,Africa Needs Its Own Research & Innovation. Not Just Borrowed Systems,"In many African countries, we use almost everything from Europe, America, and Asia. laws, education systems, technologies, and even business models. But what do we have to show for ourselves? What if, instead of copying, we conducted our own research to understand what humanity truly needs—then implemented solutions tailored to our realities?  

Imagine an Africa where:  
- We develop our own technologies based on our unique challenges and resources.  
- We create laws and policies that reflect our cultures, economies, and people’s needs.  
- We invest in scientific research that leads to homegrown industries instead of importing everything.  
- We unite as a continent to build self-sustaining economies, rather than relying on external aid and foreign corporations.  

For this to happen, we need:  
1. Massive investment in R&D:, Governments, universities, and private sectors must prioritize research.  
2. A shift in mindset:,   Africans must believe in our own capabilities instead of always looking outward.  
3. Support for local innovation: Instead of waiting for Silicon Valley, why not build the next tech revolution right here?  

Africa has the talent, the resources, and the potential. The real question is: 
When will we start believing in ourselves?

Africa,"From Tanzania to Zimbabwe: How Africa's Ruling Elite Stay in Power, Summarised","From Tanzania to Zimbabwe, Africa's ruling elites have mastered the art of staying in power. Our investigation reveals how they control foreign aid, export revenues, and patronage networks to maintain their grip while development stagnates.

# The ""Gatekeeper"" Mechanism

African leaders have perfected what political scientists call ""extraversion"" - positioning themselves as essential gatekeepers between international resources and their distribution domestically. This creates a perverse system where leaders benefit from maintaining economic dependency rather than fostering true development.

In 2020, Tanzania's President Magufuli claimed an 84% victory in elections widely criticized by the EU for lack of transparency. This follows a pattern across the continent where incumbents use state resources to suppress opposition and manipulate electoral processes.

What makes this possible? These leaders control crucial incoming financial flows:

* Export revenues (primarily from minerals and agricultural commodities)
* Foreign aid (constituting up to 90% of government budgets in countries like Ethiopia)
* International loans and investments

Instead of reinvesting these resources into diversifying their economies, ruling elites extract wealth to fuel patronage networks and offshore accounts. Angola's elite, for instance, has become one of the biggest investors in Portugal's economy while non-oil sectors at home remain starved of investment.

# The External Support Paradox

Perhaps most troubling is how Western nations often enable these authoritarian systems while claiming to champion democracy. Countries like Uganda and Rwanda receive substantial backing from Washington, London, and Paris despite their increasingly autocratic governance.

Why? These regimes are seen as guarantors of stability and valuable allies against threats like Al-Shabaab in Somalia. This creates a situation where:

1. Western powers provide legitimacy and resources to corrupt regimes
2. China offers no-strings-attached alternatives when Western pressure becomes inconvenient
3. Leaders can play these external actors against each other to maximize benefits

This undermines accountability and allows the perpetuation of local systems of inequality. As Yale historian Frederick Cooper notes, this produces ruling elites ""distant from the population it governed, exercising control over a narrow range of resources focused at the juncture of domestic and world economies.""

# Economic Stagnation and Growing Inequality

The consequences for ordinary Africans are severe. Despite narratives of ""Africa Rising,"" poverty remains endemic in many countries. The African Development Bank reports that in Nigeria, despite its oil wealth, poverty increased from 55% to 61% between 2004 and 2020, with the number of people living in poverty rising from 19 million in 1970 to 90 million by 2000.

With weak domestic tax bases and little incentive to develop independent business sectors, these economies remain vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and donor whims. Meanwhile, the disconnect between rulers and citizens grows wider.

# Is Change Possible?

Some hope may come from initiatives like the proposed African ""common market"" to allow free flow of people, goods, and capital between nations. The African Union's increasingly active peacekeeping role and efforts to hold former dictators accountable (like Hissène Habré's trial in Dakar) represent small steps toward greater accountability.

But until the fundamental economic structures enabling gatekeeper politics are addressed, Africa's ruling elites will likely continue refining their strategies for maintaining power while development stagnates.

What do you think can be done to break this cycle? Are there examples of African countries successfully moving beyond this pattern of governance?

Africa,Africa at a Crossroads: A Continent Trapped Between Superpowers,"Africa has long dreamt of true independence—an Africa free from the grip of foreign influence and self-inflicted wounds. From Kwame Nkrumah to Robert Mugabe to Julius Malema, the vision of a self-sufficient continent has echoed through generations. Yet, this dream remains just that—a dream. Former colonial powers with entrenched interests, combined with poor governance, rampant corruption, and ruthless dictatorships, have systematically undermined any real progress.

As of 2024, approximately 429 million Africans live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $2.15 per day. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia has shattered the chains of poverty, reducing extreme poverty from 65% in 1990 to just 1% by 2019. Africa, however, remains locked in a relentless struggle, where conflict, instability, and unchecked population growth keep millions trapped in hardship. For those who live here, this is not just a statistic—it is a daily reality.

Despite its challenges, Africa stands on the precipice of a rare opportunity. By 2030, it will have the world’s largest working-age population, coupled with vast natural resources capable of sustaining both itself and the global economy. But none of this will matter unless Africa confronts its governance failures and cracks down on corruption. This is no easy task. It requires visionary leadership with the foresight and determination to chart a new course.

While discussions about Africa’s development often revolve around infrastructure, trade, and investment, there is a far greater and more immediate challenge that Africa is dangerously unprepared for: the shifting global order and the battle for digital dominance.

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the global economic and geopolitical landscape. The post-World War II order—built on U.S. dominance, the Bretton Woods system, and Western-led globalization—is unraveling. In its place, a fractured global economy is emerging, led by two competing superpowers: the United States and China. Both nations understand this shift and are aggressively positioning themselves to secure economic and strategic advantages.

Africa, often dismissed as a passive player in global affairs, actually holds a unique position in this evolving landscape. For the first time in modern history, the continent has the ability to choose between two dominant forces. At first glance, China appears to be winning. Through massive infrastructure projects, direct investments, and expanding trade partnerships, China has entrenched itself in Africa’s economic framework. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has funneled billions into roads, railways, ports, and energy projects, often with fewer political conditions than Western aid. As a result, China-Africa trade has surged beyond $250 billion in recent years, dwarfing Africa’s trade with the U.S.

But while China dominates infrastructure and trade, the real battle between China and the U.S. is not about roads or bridges—it is about technology.

In the 21st century, the most valuable resource is not oil or minerals—it is data. Artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and digital services are reshaping the global economy, and whoever controls the data controls the future.

This presents a paradox for Africa. While China leads in infrastructure and trade, it keeps its most powerful tech companies inward-facing for strategic reasons. In contrast, the U.S. aggressively exports its technological dominance worldwide. From social media (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) to cloud services (Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), American tech companies have secured an unshakable grip on global data. Even TikTok, a Chinese-owned platform, operates under a Western-modified version in Africa, subject to U.S. scrutiny.

Despite China's lead in infrastructure, Africa remains structurally bound to the U.S. and Europe. The continent's financial systems still run on the U.S. dollar and Western banking institutions. Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT dictate transactions, and many African central banks hold reserves in Western financial centers. Additionally, military alliances, educational exchanges, and cultural ties still tilt toward the West.

Europe, too, struggles with America’s technological dominance but naturally aligns with the U.S. due to shared political values, NATO, and historical ties. Africa, however, does not have the luxury of default alliances. It must navigate an increasingly polarized world where choosing between China and the U.S. is not just an economic decision—it is a geopolitical gamble.

If Africa does not prioritize digital independence, it risks becoming a permanent pawn in this global rivalry. The continent must develop its own tech industry, establish AI capabilities, and enact strong data sovereignty laws. Infrastructure financing from China offers short-term benefits, and American tech dominance provides convenience, but neither superpower has Africa’s long-term interests at heart.

The future will belong to those who control their own data, build self-sustaining digital ecosystems, and create industries that serve their people rather than foreign interests. If Africa fails to act now, it will find itself in the same position it has been in for centuries—rich in resources, yet exploited by external powers.

The question is not whether Africa will be part of the new world order. The real question is: Will Africa shape its own destiny, or will it once again be shaped by others?

Africa,Marshall Plan Equivalent,"Since America has decided to go back to being a protectionist instead of free market democracy economy this will leave a vacuum for world dominance that only Russia or China can fill. 

Africa is exposed. With a vast population that can provide numerous opportunities for countries to sell to; we suffer from a lack of infrastructure development. 

This is quite evident from the past failures of VC funds trying to set base and invest in companies that would become unicorns 🦄. 
It’s quite evident that no serious change can happen when most of our infrastructure needs aren’t met. 

How can we invent the next Facebook yet majority of Africans can’t access healthcare and running water. it’s like putting a cart before the horse. Enter the Marshal Plan. 

The Marshall Plan aimed to revitalize Western European economies and prevent the spread of communist influence in the aftermath of WWII. 

The Marshall Plan generated a resurgence of European industrialization and brought extensive investment into the region. It was also a stimulant to the U.S. economy by establishing markets for American goods.

China has the money and Africa desperately needs the investments. It can be a symbiotic partnership where both parties win. Africa could be the biggest market for China. 

I read somewhere that China’s exports to US stands at 14.7%. This is projected to further decrease thanks to the trade war with US and Africa can not only cushion the trade but also take a bigger chunk of the market. Since BYD and Huawei are officially banned this can be the chance for China to specifically target us as their first choice of market. They can set up shop and industries here while they focus on the design and research. 

Should China draw up a Marshall plan for countries with serious economic potential? Think of Kenya, SA, Nigeria and Egypt?

Personally, I feel like this is our chance to come out of poverty and be positioned at the center stage of world trade. We have everything that it takes to shape the future. Our politicians are a let down but not for long.

Why???

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg815277g5o.amp

^ 

How does this make any sense? If you realize that Kenya is warming up to a psychotic mass murder why not get the African Union Involved. Kenya is a member of the AU and this has to be some sort of violation that Sudan can leverage? Especially in an International court? 

Also wouldn’t it have been way more effective to rather focus on pursing more legal campaigns against the United Arab Emirates  which is clearly funding the war. If the UAE didn’t fund the conflict the RSF would likely dissolve in a few days…it’s been two years with unceasing weapons and ammunition. Yet Sudan itself is basically destroyed ???  Which kinda doesn’t make sense how Sudan always has guns but no food? You get me? Also the lack of mention of the  many countries sponsoring the conflict in most of the wars coverage is proof of human evil at its finest. They know people will just write this off as another African war but 30 million people are starving to death. If they SAID this war is being sponsored by (X) people could take effective actions against said country and put a rapid end to the conflict. That’s like the entire population of Australia starving at once bro. 

Also, why would the first thing “Sudan” do to attack Kenya is stop **Food and Medicine from ENTERING (“IMPORT”) the country** when you have **14million internally (inside) in desperate need of Food and Medication.**? Like make that make sense? Everything else is good to come in

Africa,Where are we with the Africa Continental Free Trade Area agreements?,"The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is (or rather *should be*) the largest free trade zone in the world by far. The AfCFTA is already much larger than the European Union and ASEAN. This is good, cause it means we have alot of consumers *and* producers.

The AfCFTA aims to reduce tariffs on 90% of goods traded between African countries, and remove non-tariff barriers like customs delays, and conflicting regulations. The point is to make trade between African nations easier by encouraging the development of regional supply chains and industries rather than the old model where raw materials leave Africa only for finished products to be sold back to us. If fully implemented, this could stimulate intra-African trade to grow by more than 50% from current levels (I think it's at like 15% right now. Europe is at 60 and Asia is at 30).

As of today, 48 African countries have ratified the agreementHowever, actual trade under AfCFTA rules is still super limited. To ease our way into it, a Guided Trade Initiative (GTI) was launched in late 2022. This pilot scheme currently includes Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania, Tunisia, and more recently South Africa. Only around a dozen countries have fully begun trading under AfCFTA protocols. The rest are still preparing.

I think part of the issue here is that not all African governments are equally interested or capable when it comes to free intra-African trade. Some fear loss of revenue from tariffs, others worry about exposing fragile domestic industries to competition. The other issues are ever-present in discussions about Africa; poor infrastructure and conflict in certain regions.

I still think this could and should be done before 2035. This is one of those things where we are only held back by how effective our governments are.

Africa,Kenya proposes to South Africa.... 🇰🇪🇿🇦,"In December of 2019, two strangers were among thousands of young people who had been invited to attend a prestigious program called World Youth Forum in the city of Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt. However, John Nyagaka from Kenya and Anathi Tshabe from South Africa were two worlds apart that were oblivious to their fate as they did not anticipate to be drawn into the embrace of a happy ending while pursuing their respective professional ambitions. 

As the days of the program progressed, and shortly after three days upon the inception, John states that he noticed Anathi wandering alone among other participants in an overwhelming crowd. He was in the company of a Nigerian friend when Anathi caught his attention and curiosity persuaded him to approach her. They engaged in a brief conversation while exchanging contact details. Anathi has expressed that John couldn't escape her eyes afterwards, and which is quite interesting as she had not identified him anywhere prior to their meeting. She disclosed that their love story is a testament to alignment - suggesting that John's appearance was not simply a coincidence, but rather a purposeful and divinely guided event in her life. John has equally expressed that their connection was a beautiful cliché of timing. They believe that they were in the right place at the right time. 

The conclusion of the program's duration in Egypt culminated in John and Anathi intending to keep in touch as they looked forward to a new year of uncertainty. They fostered a friendship to develop a foundation that would help them navigate compatibility. Anathi frequently visited Kenya to familiarize herself with John's immediate upbringing, and this involved following in the trails to his childhood in Kisii among other activities. On the other hand, John also extended the courtesy by embarking on trips to several parts of South Africa and particularly Anathi's home of Queenstown in the Eastern Cape province. John's heritage of Kisii alongside the Xhosa origins of Anathi present an intercultural affinity that has inspired a blend and balance of novelty in their love. The pair experienced the trust between their distance evolving into a stronger and closer intimacy. Without fail, they eventually transitioned into a genuine and enduring romantic relationship. 

In the near end of 2024, John set himself apart as a man with a sincere desire to commit to a lifetime with the start of a shared life. He carried a ring in his pocket and a promise in his heart as he gracefully walked into the sunset of Nungwi beach in Zanzibar to go down on one knee and ask for Anathi's hand in marriage. The successful outcome of the proposal had the couple jubilating in happiness and excitement for the beginning of a new life together. 

Anathi is an LLB graduate from the University of the Free State, and an admitted attorney of the High Court in South Africa. She recently completed a Masters of Management Science in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in China on a Schwarzman scholarship. John's background encompasses interests in education, information technology and health. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the Ashesi University and is currently studying a Masters program of Health Informatics at the University of Toronto in Canada to catalyse his passion for harnessing technology in healthcare systems. 

In spite of the aforementioned prospects, the engaged couple has adamantly reassured a priority to tie the knot and strive for a prosperous union.

Africa,"It's not about minerals, Africa is to Europe what China is to the US - a potential/future threat.","I was watching the speech of a french senator addressing the situation that Europe finds itself in with the recent developments in the US and this part caught my attention.

> The global south is waiting for the outcome of this conflict to decide whether they should continue respecting Europe or trample over it


Of course we know who he was referring to, not Australia, they are an ally, it's not South America, obviously. He doesn't say Asia or middle East, no it's us. And yes maybe I am overthinking a simple statement, but I don't think that was a slipped tongue in such a well structured and delivered speech.

Now let me also make it clear that I don't think any African nation has any form of ambitions on Europe now or in the future(at least not that I know of), but it doesn't matter what I or most Africans think, it matters what Europe thinks we are thinking.

Africa is a failed mission for 19nth to 20th century Europe. You see, colonisation in Africa is often compared to colonisation in Asia, but they are not the same. In Asia, the mission was to get control of the trade. I'd assume the mission statement in European perspective was in the lines of 'those people have a lot of products and trade routes, but we have more arms, let's use our arms to take over the trade.'

 In Africa, the mission was to occupy, similar to what they did in Australia and the Americas. The mission was simple, 'go to that land, inhabit it, kill anybody who comes in your way.' However, unlike in Australia, the US, Canada etc, they didn't succeed in taking over the land, instead Africans struggled in various ways until they finally won.

So where do comparisons of Africa - Europe with China - US arise? Well, the US and China are 2 very different nations yet at the heart of it they have the same ambitions - to be the greatest nation of the earth/center of everything human species related. They both structured their societies differently, though. The US is an individualistic society, with individualistic philosophies from Rome and Greece being more dominant while China is a collectivist society with philosophies like Confucianism being more dominant. The US and China are 2 totally different societies and yet their ambitions means that they both can't succeed, one has to be the nation 'at the centre.' However, China was more of a long term threat and in the past US even worked with it to dominate the cold war. But still China remained it's biggest - potential/future - threat with Russia, more of the immediate threat.

As I said earlier, Africa is a European failed mission. From the perspective of Europe, Africa hates them and waits for a chance to be strong (or Europe weak) to take revenge. With this perspective, Europe, don't see a future where a strong Africa coexist with them. I think it's why the West handles African development projects like a hot potato. They are willing to spend on aid and other spendings that could help Africa, to maintain the 'we are not bad, we are friends you know' attitude without really helping in the development of the continent, the way the west invest in other places like Asia. In my opinion, neocolonialism is not about minerals, there are a lot of places in the world with minerals and weaker economies than African nations, that can be easily exploited. There are also African nations without that much minerals, so if it's about minerals, there wouldn't be much interference in their affairs. Neocolonialism is about keeping the beast that is Africa in check long enough to postpone (or even prevent depending on how future Africa interprets history) a war with Europe.

Again this is me trying to analyse the Europe elite class perspective of Africa based on a little statement. I could be wrong. I know most Africans don't really think of Africa as a threat to Europe (even a developed Africa). I'm also probably overthinking the statement, but it did come to my attention that his whole speech is about US - Europe - Ukraine and Russia, and yet he manages to sneak us there, not the middle east, not Asia - us. Kind of like how the US manages to sneak China in every speech about a threat even one unrelated to China. This is imo how him and probably a majority of Europe sees us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/s/002EDX2e0Y,,development aid kenya

Francis Kéré, the first African architect to win the Pritzker Prize in 2022, is leading the design of a mausoleum in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, to honor former president Thomas Sankara and his 12 aides assassinated in 1987. The mausoleum is part of the larger Thomas Sankara Memorial project, initiated by President Ibrahim Traoré, and aims to be a space for public gatherings, study, and cultural events.

Kéré’s design incorporates traditional materials like laterite and earth to naturally cool the interior, minimizing the need for air conditioning. The site will include an 87-meter-high tower, an amphitheater, and preserved remnants of the original attack location. The project emphasizes sustainability, community involvement, and honoring Sankara’s legacy of social justice and development.
Kéré met Sankara when he came to speak to students in Fada Ngourma, the capital of Burkina Faso's Eastern region and he finds building his place of rest as a testament to the power of architecture.

Africa,Why the EAC Was More Effective Than SADC in Keeping Peace in the DRC.,"
The DRC has been a theater of instability in the region for years now, with numerous armed groups, weak state institutions, and vast mineral wealth feeding the war. The two regional blocs, the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community, have tried to stabilize the country over the past years, with very different results: whereas the EAC's regional force succeeded in largely defusing the situation, the intervention by SADC has been marred by procrastination and strategic blunders.

This therefore brings out a number of questions as to why EAC was more successful than SADC in bringing peace in the DRC. The reasons for this combination relate to geopolitical interests, military strategy, political will, and logistical capacity.

Geopolitical Interests and Proximity

The EAC had a more direct stake in the DRC conflict compared to SADC. Several EAC member states, including Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, and Tanzania, have economic and security interests related to the stability of eastern DRC. Historically, the region has seen intense involvement from Uganda and Rwanda, at times supporting different armed groups and competing for control over the regional resources. To Kenya, the DRC is seen as one of the giant economic hubs into which it ought to expand and increase trade, while Burundi shares security concerns with Sudan resulting from cross-border instability.

This proximity gave the EAC a greater sense of urgency to act swiftly and effectively. Unlike SADC, which is dominated by states like South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe—countries located far from the DRC—the EAC members viewed the crisis as a regional security threat that required immediate attention.

Military Deployment and Strategic Approach

The EAC was more effective and flexible in its military operation. It deployed the EACRF at the end of 2022 with troops from Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan quickly moving into key conflict areas such as Goma, Bunagana, and Rutshuru. With that speed, EACRF attained an advantage over strategic locations, while several armed groups, such as M23, could not expand their captured territories.

One of the reasons why EACRF had been successful was that they maintained a proper balance between military presence and diplomacy: Kenyan leadership played a pivotal role in negotiating temporary ceasefires and direct contacts with rebel groups. Partial withdrawals without heavy fighting prevented unnecessary escalation. Such limited withdrawals have given way to a long-term political solution.

Serious setbacks were also suffered in deployment by the SADC Force, which relied mostly on conventional warfare. By the time the SADC forces arrived in the theatre of operations, the dynamics on the ground had changed and the rebel groups had adapted. SADC has a history of going on full military intervention, as witnessed in Lesotho (1998) and the DRC (1998-2003); hence, less emphasis is placed on the art of diplomacy, but much emphasis is given to outright combat, which hasn't largely worked in the current DRC crisis.

Political Will and Coordination

The other principal divide between the two blocs was the expression of political coordination. The EAC demonstrated coherence and commitment toward the peacekeeping mission. Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania provided a united diplomatic intervention, supported by Burundi with troop deployment for border regional stabilization. All these put together meant swift decisions with a focused direction in trying to contain the crisis.

By comparison, SADC had to grapple with internal divisions as a result of how best to handle the conflict in the DRC. South Africa, traditionally the dominant player within SADC, was reluctant to commit large resources due to domestic challenges. The presence of national strategic interests within the DRC by Angola and Zimbabwe complicated consensus on a military and diplomatic strategy for SADC. Its intervention thus proved slower, more reactive, and less effective than the EACRF mission.

Logistical and Economic Benefits

Logistics was also very instrumental in this intervention of EAC. A well-equipped Kenyan military with advanced infrastructure was strategically positioned, hence ensuring rapid deployment of its troops with sustained supply chains. Nairobi was equally important in a logistical way because it guaranteed reinforcement and resupply to EACRF forces that were involved in operations within DRC.

On the other hand, SADC lacked a coherent logistical base. Its forces had to be moved over long distances. This led to delays in reinforcements, supply deficiencies, and operational inefficiencies. Again this diminished the capacity of SADC to effectively make a timely intervention.
Impact and Future Implications

The relatively successful approach of the EAC in the DRC goes to demonstrate that regional organizations with direct stakes in the conflicts are often better placed in mediating and stabilizing such crises. The EACRF, while not without limitations such as inability to completely disarm the M23 rebels, at least succeeded in preventing further escalation and in creating conditions for dialogue.

SADC needs to change its intervention strategy in the DRC if it is to be more effective. It should instead focus on diplomatic engagement, better coordination with the Congolese government, and preparedness on the part of SADC's military machinery. Otherwise, SADC risks prolonging the conflict rather than resolving it.

My opinion:

The reason the intervention of the East African Community in the DRC was somewhat more successful compared to SADC's has to do with several important reasons: stronger geopolitical interests, high speed, political coordination, and a well-balanced military-diplomatic approach. Meanwhile, SADC suffered from slow deployment, internal divisions, and reliance on conventional military tactics that prevented it from making any meaningful impact.

Regional peacekeeping operations in Africa going forward need to be characterized more by speed, adaptability, and regional cooperation rather than mere military intervention. If the objective is lasting peace in the DRC, then diplomatic engagement and well-planned interventions strategically implemented-as in this approach by EAC-will far outmatch the use of brute force.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1igg38h/why_the_eac_was_more_effective_than_sadc_in/,,development aid kenya

Kenya,The Israel-Gaza War: A Symptom of a Looming Global Showdown,"At first glance, BRICS, the rise of the AfD, Trump, USAID, China, the Russo-Ukraine war, and the surge of right-wing politics in Europe seem unrelated to the conflict in Israel. However, they are all pieces of a larger geopolitical struggle—one that signals a growing divide between the Global North and the rising Global South.

For decades, Western powers dominated global affairs, leveraging economic sanctions, military interventions, and financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to maintain control. But this order is being challenged. The first major warning came with the Russia-Ukraine war. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions, expecting Russia’s economy to collapse. Instead, Russia pivoted to the Global South, deepening trade ties with China, India, and other BRICS nations. Not only did Russia’s economy remain stable, but it also continued producing advanced weaponry without Western technology—something previously thought impossible.

Then came October 7, 2023. Israel, the West’s key ally in the Middle East, was attacked in an unprecedented assault that exposed severe weaknesses in its security apparatus. Israel’s much-vaunted military—long perceived as invincible—was caught off guard and humiliated. This was a serious blow, not just to Israel but to Western hegemony itself. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 had already shattered the myth of Western military invulnerability. The Russian invasion of Ukraine further demonstrated that Western deterrence was weakening. If Israel—a nuclear-armed state backed by the U.S.—could be so easily struck, what message would that send to the rest of the world?

Western powers needed to respond forcefully, not just to defend Israel, but to reassert their dominance. Their message is clear: We will arm Israel no matter what. We will support them regardless of civilian casualties. And we will broadcast the destruction of Gaza for all to see—so you understand that resistance is futile.

This is not just about Israel or Palestine. It’s about power. The Global North is watching as the Global South—led by China and supported by Russia—grows economically and demographically. BRICS is expanding, challenging the U.S.-led financial order. Right-wing populism is surging in Europe as economic strains push Western nations inward. The U.S. is increasingly relying on military-industrial alliances and foreign interventions to maintain its grip on global affairs.

The Israel-Gaza conflict is a symptom of this broader struggle. It is a power play—a brutal display meant to reinforce the notion that, despite its decline, the Western order will not relinquish control without a fight. But the cracks are showing, and history suggests that no empire, no matter how dominant, can hold back change forever",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/,2025-02-26 00:00:00,USAID

Kenya,Need Advice,"Hello. Ok, so, I finished High school last year (KCSE) and I need advice on which course I should apply for. I'd say I'm pretty flexible but I'm mainly debating between two courses, Medicine and Surgery vs. Dental Surgery.

I've spoken to different professionals in both fields and all have different things to say. I'd like to weigh demand and working conditions for each of them and how this is expected to change in, say, 7 years, around when I'll graduate. Also, I've seen that there are a lot of unemployed doctors despite there being an apparent demand in the health sector.

Those who are already in the field or are studying at the moment, what would you say about this? And which of the two is likely to be in higher demand in 7 years. Lay people as well, what are the expected trends in the health sector in future (factoring in USAID and everything😗).

Also, would it be better to commute from home or to live closer to school in hostels or students residencies, especially for demanding fields. Anyone can answer this, I appreciate any help. I'm also considering Pharmacy and Nursing (BSN).

THANKYOU❤️

P.S: Any related advice which I have not exactly asked for here is still very welcome

Nairobi,Theres always someone out there worse off than you.,"I was talking to my South Sudanese friend yesterday,when he asked me if there were any job opportunities I could refer him to.He said that he's been unemployed since the massive turnoff of USAID jobs.

I'm like why cant he look for another job. He told me that getting a job in Kenya,you first need to process a work permit and that's 20k and plus he used to work in Class D,so that's 500k extra.He was like he couldn't afford that. So I told him to begin at home-like what about his home country.

And he said that was even worse. Unless you're a Dinka in South Sudan you're ot getting a job(think of them like Kikuyus in Kenya).He said that even scholarships aren't spared,the best scholarships go to the Dinkas.I thought that he was a tribalist until I later on saw that it was [true.Now](http://true.Now) in South Sudan,they aren't like in Kenya,In Kenya,companies are actually obliged to employ kenyans first before foreigners.I think a guy mentioned it in the sub a few hours ago...

In South Sudan, it's actually the opposite-they actually employ people who aren't South Sudanese-like if you're a Ugandan,youre more likely to get a job opportunity there and so on...(again other than if you're a Dinka).I mean this guys are corrupt(but not more corrupt than KASONGO,lol)

And on top of that South Sudan's employment rate is 12,49 compared to Kenya's at 5.7%.They also have-and this actually shocked me.Wueeh only 5.1% of people there have access to electricity.And also south Sudan has the least literacy rates in the WORLD at 34.52%.

I know Kasongo aliharibu hii nchi lakini damn,not to be respectful,you cant pay me enough money to live in South Sudan(no disrespect to South Sudanese-I actually love yall).

Nairobi,My experience with the USAID Money.,"The list of companies who've been getting money from USAID is out and looking at it, I'm questioning whether we needed USAID in the first place. Sometimes back, a childhood friend who runs an NGO at the Coast called me that he'd be attending a USAID Conference at a location in Nairobi's Blue zone. The following day (Monday), I passed by the hotel to say hi at around Lunch hour. To gain access, I had to write my name and a few details at the entrance of the conference facility. Later that day i received around $130 from USAID. I continued receiving different amounts from USAID every evening until Friday that week. In total, I think I received around $600. I called him on Friday evening, told him of the amounts I had been receiving from the conference. He asked me to take half and send him half but I told him I'll just take one fuel tank $190 and send him the rest, which I did.
 
This experience reminded me of two stories. 
1. A lady that I highly respect (she's in this sub and has experience with grants and fundraising) once told me about the NGO world and that the main objective of most of the NGO's in Kenya is to swindle donor funds. I didn't take her seriously but now looking at the list of the organizations that have been collecting millions from USAID, with minimal to zero impact, I now agree with her. She was right. 

2. I once had a fling who was a CEC-M in one of the counties in Kenya. She used to be passionate about the need for NGO regulation and holding NGO's accountable for every penny they receive from donors to ensure that such funds are properly utilized to impact the targeted population. I didn't take her seriously and thought that maybe as a government official in her county, she just jealous that she had no cut in NGOs money. She was however speaking from a point of knowledge - Her mother, an NGO director was out earning her father who was an accomplished Professor and a researcher (Do you know how much you need to make to outearn a reputable researcher?)- Looking at the USAID list, now she's making sense to me than ever. 

Note:
1. I sympathize with the thousands of families who are going to be affected by the loss of livelihoods from USAID's exit.. 
2. I also sympathize with the millions of families whose unfortunate flights are used by NGO's to secure funding only for such funds to be redirected to the Director's private exploits. 
3. I advocate for working systems where all entities can be held accountable and more do where the Government can be diligent and efficient to an extent where we achieve self reliance and therefore don't rely on donor funds in the first place.

Sijui  niite bahati ama kuponea chupu chupu. Nimeitiwa hustle flani nikiwa hapo CBD , nayo mimi afisa mtiifu wa Generali Shillingi ya Kenya nikareport post . post ilikua hapo kamukunji.  I was given a days contract as clerk wa kudistribute  ""jst arrived"" USAID relief food , in my mind I was like this is God , I arrived in town that morning for an interview ya izi mboka za gulf .Anyways kijana nimepiga m&s zangu  za pale T2 safi , navy blue pants n a white shirt, chini  nimefunga hesabu na dark brown boots , Clarks flani I scored gikomba na bei ya Sunday (btw Sunday bei NI ya -wananchi-) .

Alright post pleasantries tume exchange na mama Mikey, ( shes the one who called me in )  nikaonyeshwa desk na mine forms pale tayari , lakini si mnajua Tu mambo ya hii serikali msongo, relief food kwa TV walishapiga picha za exchange handshake, lakini kwa ground Lori ya mikate ndo imefika pekee sasa NI tutegee Lori ya unga na mafuta iko hapo' Uhuru highway'.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

geopolitics,Order Without America: How the International System Can Survive a Hostile Washington,"\[SS from essay by Ngaire Woods, Professor of Global Economic Governance and Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.\]

In a remarkably short time, the second Trump administration has upended many of the precepts that have guided international order since the end of World War II. President Donald Trump has rapidly redefined the U.S. role in NATO while questioning U.S. defense guarantees to Europe and Japan and even intelligence sharing with its Five Eyes partners: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. At the United Nations, the United States has sided with Russia and other erstwhile adversaries, such as Belarus and North Korea, and against nearly all its traditional democratic allies. European officials, scrambling to react, have begun wondering whether they need to develop their own nuclear deterrents and whether Washington will continue to maintain U.S. troops on the continent.

Yet just as important as these security considerations is the administration’s rejection of the treaties, organizations, and economic institutions that the United States has done so much to shape. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued executive orders to withdraw from the [UN](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/united-nations) Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and imposed a 90-day pause on all delivery of U.S. foreign aid. In early February, he ordered a sweeping 180-day review of all international organizations to which the United States belongs and “all conventions and treaties to which the United States is a party.” And more aggressive moves may be coming: Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for the second Trump administration, which has anticipated many Trump policies, calls for a U.S. exit from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/international-monetary-fund) (IMF) and the World Bank, cornerstones of global development and economic stability that the United States has for decades guided with a firm hand.

geopolitics,The Geopolitics of Tariffs,"Thoughts on this? I think the article is overall good, though it glosses over the domestic economic impacts on policy and power of corporations and markets to influence policy.

Full text: 
The Geopolitics of Tariffs
By George Friedman

There are two analytic principles worth repeating before delving into the raft of tariffs the Trump administration issued last week. The first is that we have entered into an unanchored world order, a state in which one geopolitical era transitions to the next. All things that were certain in the past have become uncertain – the storm before the calm that I applied to U.S. politics.

The second is the distinction between geopolitical imperatives and geopolitical engineering. Geopolitical imperatives force nations to act in certain (and predictable) ways. Geopolitical engineering is how nations manage their geopolitical imperatives, a process that requires balancing a nation’s domestic politics between those who welcome the new reality and those who oppose it. The outcome is predictable, even if the process by which it emerges is less so, apart from the outcome dictated by geopolitical reality.

With that in mind, the current geopolitical reality is this: The world order that had been in place throughout the 20th century has eroded, and a new era is being engineered. We are in a period in which the norms of the past century are no longer relevant. It is an infrequent and unsettling time, but throughout human history, this has been a normal abnormality.

The order of the past 100 years or so began with Western European empires, which used their access to the Atlantic Ocean to dominate much of the rest of the world, particularly the non-European parts of the Eastern Hemisphere. Eastern Europe was largely excluded from imperial power. The United Kingdom took the lion’s share of imperial wealth, followed by France, Spain and the Netherlands. That the Continent was so fragmented into independent states made war inevitable.

This European century comprised three distinct phases. The first was Germany’s attempt to restructure its imperium and thus Europe, leading to the First World War. The second phase was World War II, which resulted in a weak and divided Europe but an ascendant power in the Soviet Union and the United States. Their respective needs to access the Atlantic and to control Atlantic Europe led to the third phase, the Cold War. The U.S. and the Soviets partitioned Europe, the former taking the west and the latter taking the east. The conflict that ensued featured a confrontation in Europe along the east-west divide and, crucially, a global proxy war for the vestiges of Europe’s empires. Direct wars, proxy battles, and covert and overt operations were waged in Africa and Asia, the Middle East and South America, always contained by the geopolitical reality of mutual assured destruction through nuclear war.

Central to U.S. Cold War strategy was the creation of an economic system that benefited Washington at Moscow’s expense. The economic benefits of allying with the U.S. outweighed the benefits of allying with the Soviets. Moscow could offer support to regimes that ruled a country but not to the country itself. The U.S. could do both. Washington used its vast wealth to manage Western Europe and the so-called Third World. It engineered a strategy to liberalize and facilitate trade throughout the U.S.-led capitalist West. This strategy included tariffs, which allowed recovering European and emerging Third World economies to access the U.S. market. Free trade – as a principle if not a reality – was thus a major weapon in the Cold War, one that helped rebuild Western Europe and undermine the Soviet Union. It wasn’t cheap, but the U.S. was able to foot the bill. Its wealth allowed its economy to operate effectively in spite of imbalanced tariffs and foreign aid. It was politically successful too; U.S. domestic prices stayed low because of the low costs of imported goods, produced as they were by cheap labor. It was a win-win for the U.S. and its client states.

In some ways, the Cold War outlived the fall of communism. Russia remained a military power, and the U.S. continued its strategy of military and economic warfare. But the war in Ukraine was the true nail in the Cold War coffin. The limits of Russian military and economic power forced Washington to reconsider its imperative to resist Russia by defending Europe and, indeed, the very value of the economic dimension of the Cold War. The transfer of industrial production to areas of the collapsed European alliance created a system of reliance in the U.S. on foreign production.

In simple terms, this means that the suspension or disruption of exports from these countries, especially China, could undermine the U.S. economy. The countries on which the U.S. depended were subject to internal forces such as strikes, insurrections, coups and so on. The financial costs and benefits to the United States in this relationship have changed, and the risks of dependency are growing greater as offshoring increases. For example, China might choose to forego the economic benefits of exports to the U.S. in favor of the political or military benefits of weakening American production. Strikes or unrest in Europe might do the same, even without the intent of harming the United States.

Free trade – or trade in which tariffs strengthen other countries’ finances and weaken the buyer’s economy – can become so extreme that the risks outweigh the benefits. The financial dimension may be positive or negative for a nation, but the availability of manufactured goods depends not only on the benefits to the exporting countries but also on the geopolitical ambitions (and the stability) of those countries. China is a historically unstable country. Other countries are more or less so. The danger of a nation that is unable to continue shipping essential products to the U.S. because of ambition, war or instability is magnified insofar as it relies on imports to drive its own economy.

Availability and low prices are not guaranteed in international trade. The U.S. created a system that was in theory beneficial but in reality vulnerable to internal events in exporting countries. However, accompanied by accelerating financial imbalances, the system became obsolete. It is therefore unsurprising that as the Russian threat subsides, the U.S. is changing its strategies, including on trade.

We are moving from a process of imperatives generated by geopolitical realities to the engineering of a new reality. Financial matters are part of the economic process just as military matters are part of the geographic process, and both are part of geopolitics. The recent surge in tariffs is part of the reengineering of the financial system. Whereas broad geopolitical analysis has a disconcerting elegance, engineering has a more detailed reality. Consider a river and the engineering of a bridge over it. The course of the river is predictable. Engineering is more complex and susceptible to error. When we look at President Donald Trump’s recent actions, the river must be crossed, but building a bridge is complex and uncertain – and vulnerable to error. Thus, a blueprint for redefining the system must be designed, though the outcome of Trump’s initial actions is uncertain, even if their intent seems clear.

His intention is to shock the system, and I assume to open the door to more precise engineering, though this must be demonstrated in history and then either codified as the prior system was or rapidly discarded as an economic failure. There are many economic interests in sectors of the U.S. economy where the immediate benefit outweighs the long-term risks, as well as sectors where the financial reality has already had a great impact. Trump is clearly trying to get as much done as he can within his first 100 days – before the honeymoon period ends. With about 20 days left, and with the Democrats recovering from the shock of defeat and the Republicans unsure but still loyal, Trump may conclude that long-term planning and coalition building are impossible. But as other presidents before him have done, he is acting quickly and drastically, hoping to revise later as needed. This is an engineering matter, acting with unexpected speed in a seemingly incoherent way, restructuring when forced to retreat by strong opposition nationally and internationally but having established the strategic principle for the negotiations that will engineer the outcome.

The imperative is to move beyond the trading system that Russia’s weakness made obsolete. This behavior is not unprecedented, and it was not conjured from thin air. But the engineering is where uncertainty lives.

InternationalDev,Are any of you in Peru or do work with the Peruvian Amazon?,"I’m a recreational travel blogger and I’m in the middle of writing a post about my trip to the Amazon. I stopped at this manatee and wildlife rehab center (in Iquitos) and saw that it was supported by USAID. On the off chance one of you knows about this project or can find out background about it, that would be helpful. I should’ve asked before I left, but didn’t think about it until I started writing. 

I am not an ‘influencer,’ and this (blogging/writing) is not a money-making venture. (I’m a college mathematics professor during the school year.) But I do have a very modest following (just under 10k), and in the past I’ve been able to rally support to the tune of $3k-$5k USD for various causes (laptops and cell phones for guides in Kenya, an orphanage in Uganda, educational supplies for a village in the Philippines). 

I’m hoping that with any insider knowledge you might have, I’ll be able to tell a compelling story and 1) force people into calling their reps/senators, 2) help donate to this specific cause. 

The closure and illegal dismantling of USAID has hit me hard. I cannot think about, write about, or talk about it without breaking down in tears. In particular, knowing the children of sub-Saharan Africa are dying of starvation fucking *haunts* me. I’m trying to do what I can to get more eyes on the eradication of such a vital part of the US government’s outreach.

Today I’m working at an organization staring down deep cuts that my position might not survive. So no, I don’t have a lot of affection for what the U.S. has done to foreign assistance lately. And I’ve watched as other donors join in the race to the bottom. Demoralizing for sure.

But here’s the thing I’ve been wrestling with: what if some good actually comes out of this?

Let’s be honest. Even before this administration aid budgets weren’t exactly overflowing. But somehow we kept announcing new initiatives. New programs. New organizations. All drawing from the same shrinking pool of funds.

It's left developing countries navigating a maze of compounding and sometimes conflicting reporting requirements, audits, frameworks, and buzzwords all just to access less and less support.

At a certain point, you have to ask: who is this system really built for? Could this moment be an opportunity? To rethink how development actually works. To consolidate, streamline and modernize what already exists. To make access to funding simpler. Fewer layers. Fewer hoops. Maybe to make reforms happen that would have been unlikely otherwise?

I’m not saying this is how change *should* happen. There were far better, way less painful ways. But if we’re stuck with this reality maybe it forces the sector to rebuild smarter. Maybe we end up with a system that better serves the countries it’s supposed to help and better reflects the values that brought so many of us into this work to begin with.

InternationalDev,Enrich's newly released statement on what happened at USAID,"Nicholas Enrich was fired for sounding the alarm about the dismantling of USAID. Today he testified at the hearing and his 27 page statement detailed the below timeline. 

Timeline of the USAID Global Health Shutdown: 

JANUARY 2025

Jan 20: Trump issues an executive order halting most U.S. foreign aid, including lifesaving health programs.

Jan 25: USAID terminates contracts for half of its global health staff, including doctors, disease experts, and support teams.

Jan 28: Secretary of State Marco Rubio issues a ""humanitarian exception"" for life-saving aid. 

Jan 31: 19 more staff are put on leave under a new executive order targeting “gender ideology.” Staff working on women’s health were among those targeted.

FEBRUARY 2025

Feb 1–6: Enrich approves emergency Ebola response under the humanitarian waivers. Partners are told to restart operations.

But USAID leadership secretly blocks payments, making it impossible to act.

Feb 7: Financial systems are shut down, and DOGE refuses to turn them back on.

NGOs that work with USAID cannot implement those life-saving programs as they have not been recieving paymens.

Feb 11–14: USAID leaders claim the humanitarian aid wasn’t paused. They then rewrite the rules, stripping Enrich and his team ability to authorize humanitarian waivers. 

From that day forward, not a single lifesaving health program was approved again (until yesterday, when several TB programs were un-terminated but with no guidance). 

Feb 23: After a court order expires, only 70 Global Health employees remain out of 783. The rest are fired, furloughed, or locked out.

Feb 24–26: USAID leadership:

- Kills programs for Ebola, Polio, maternal health, malnutrition, and more.

- Terminates UNICEF’s contract, halting Ebola response during a deadly outbreak in Uganda.

- Ignores warnings that these decisions will lead to mass death and global disease spread.

They argue the TRO doesn’t stop them from using other legal loopholes (outside the EO) to suspend or cancel funding.

InternationalDev,USAID’s largest partners report furloughs for thousands of staff,"“The dismantling of U.S. foreign assistance isn’t just affecting USAID — it’s scorching even the biggest aid organizations across the world,” reports Elissa Miolene for Devex News.

For more than 50 years, FHI 360 has reached thousands across the world. In Ethiopia, that has meant treating children suffering from malnutrition; in Ukraine, that’s meant bringing mobile medical clinics to communities with bombed-out hospitals. 

Those programs were funded by USAID, the agency which, three weeks ago, was the largest bilateral donor in the world. But over the last three weeks, USAID has been brought to pieces. And day by day, its partners have gone down with it. 
FHI 360 is just one of countless organizations to be hit, furloughing 36% of its staff — including 200 in its North Carolina headquarters — last week alone. 

“Most leaders are in firefighting mode,” said Kim Kucinskas, a director at the nonprofit group Humentum. But at the same time, she said, organizations have had to continue to ensure they’re keeping on top of other programs not funded by the U.S. government. “It’s this balance between crisis management, and needing to keep the trains running on time.”

Today, eight organizations — including some of USAID’s largest contracting partners, DAI and Chemonics International — sued President Donald Trump, USAID, the U.S. Department of State, and others for “irreparable harm” in the wake of USAID’s dismantling. 

In the lawsuit, the organizations laid out the damage: DAI, for example, has furloughed between 65% and 70% of its workforce — some 383 employees — and reduced salaries for senior staff members by 20%. Democracy International, a nonprofit focused on democratic governance, has furloughed 100% of its 95 U.S.-based employees and placed 163 staff members overseas — 92% of those abroad — on administrative leave. And Chemonics International, an organization that was once a USAID contracting powerhouse, has furloughed 750 of its U.S.-based staff — more than 63% of its American workforce — and reduced the hours of another 300. 
“These programs cannot simply be restarted on command,” the lawsuit states. “USAID’s partners are hemorrhaging resources and employees.” 

The list goes on. Management Sciences for Health, a Virginia-based nonprofit, has furloughed half its U.S. staff, with the court filing stating the organization may soon terminate another 1,000 employees abroad. HIAS, a nonprofit focused on refugee resettlement, has laid off 500 of its international staff. There are reports of deep cuts at Catholic Relief Services and Resonance, a Vermont-based contractor, has laid off all but a dozen of its 100-person workforce.

The International Republican Institute, or IRI — a nonprofit focused on freedom and democracy — has also been forced to furlough two-thirds of its workforce, some 200 people. More are expected to follow, and IRI is now shutting down more than 20 of its offices overseas, according to someone with knowledge of the organization’s internal decision-making. 
USAID Stop-Work, a coalition of former, current, and affiliated USAID staff, has counted more than 11,300 American jobs lost across 43 states — and nearly 52,000 across the world. 

“Without having money in place, organizations have had to lay off staff and or stop procurement orders for essential products, and that is not something that can just be turned back on if money were to become available,” said one former USAID official, who spoke during a virtual press conference assembled by USAID staff last week. “This has resulted in consequences for every region in the world.” 

Smaller organizations often receive lines of credit from USAID, which they draw on to do the contracted work. Larger organizations often do that contracted work, and then invoice USAID for reimbursement. With USAID’s payment system frozen since last month, both systems have been broken. In Central America, that means shelters previously supporting young people fleeing gang recruitment are now closed; across the world, that means $150 million of health commodities, including antiretroviral medications, are stranded in warehouses. 

“It’s in the hundreds of millions of dollars owed for services already provided, and of course, some multiples of that when it comes to what is being asked to be floated during the 90-day review,” said Tom Hart, the president and chief executive officer of InterAction. “That’s why at least in the INGO sector, we’re seeing mass layoffs, country programs stopped, and some organizations looking at shutting their doors.” 

Organizations have been forced to shift money around to cover costs or lay off staff to save on program expenses. And for many of USAID’s largest partners, that means they’re out millions of dollars for work they’ve already done. 

The Professional Services Council, or PSC, a trade association of more than 400 government contractors, said federal agencies currently owe its members some $500 million in unpaid work. 

Humentum surveyed 100 organizations to ask the same, finding that nearly three-quarters of respondents said their organization had not been paid for work completed before Jan. 24. The court filing breaks things down further: DAI is owed $120 million for work completed before the stop-work order began while Chemonics is out $103.6 million for the same. 

The U.S. seeks to gut UNICEF work plans of references promoting “gender ideology,” and diversity, equity and inclusion.

“What happens when those invoices are not paid?” said PSC’s president, David Berteau, in a press release. “Without reimbursement for funds already disbursed, companies will run short of cash.” 

Earlier today, Kucinskas gathered human resource leaders for Humentum’s people and culture roundtable, a regular convening of those across the global development space. The mood was heavy as organizations compared how they were making their calculus, Kucinskas said. 

“Some said: I’ve been around for a while, and have been through crises before,” she added. “But this is a whole other level. It’s physically, emotionally, mentally exhausting.”

*Dear Friends & Family,*

*As some of you already know, my organization and I have been directly impacted by President Trump's* [*freeze on foreign aid*](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/world/usaid-us-foreign-aid-freeze-humanitarian-crises-intl/index.html) *and the* [*dismantling of USAID*](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/usaid-musk-trump-rubio-cuts.html)*, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).*

*\[Update to fit your situation\] I have been furloughed/laid off/am expecting to be laid off. My organization is preparing for layoffs of XXX people around the world. Hundreds of my former colleagues have already lost their jobs.* 

*There are legitimate debates to have about the effectiveness of foreign aid, and I personally believe reform is needed. But decisions like this belong to Congress. The unilateral move to shut down USAID without congressional approval sets a dangerous precedent and paves the way for the executive branch to dismantle other agencies at will.*

*It has also been really hurtful to see my community, people who have dedicated their lives and careers to the idea that we can make the world a better place, be vilified by the President and Elon Musk, called ""criminals"" and ""vipers.""* 

*That’s why I’m asking for your help in contacting your representatives to oppose this unconstitutional overreach, regardless of your views on foreign aid. I've included a call script and where to find contact information for each of your representatives. (Calls are taken more seriously than emails by Members of Congress.)* 

*I’d also welcome the opportunity to talk more about the impact of this decision or answer any questions you have about USAID or foreign aid.*

*Thank you,*

A huge coalition of nonprofits and state AGs [sued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-28/trump-administration-sued-over-omb-halt-to-federal-grants?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy) hours after the federal payments freeze was announced, and they appear to be winning. Meanwhile, my sources in the INGO community say that no organization is willing to step up and serve as plaintiff in a similar case regarding the foreign aid freeze, which took effect days earlier, and instead everyone is just going along with the stop work orders and furloughing/firing staff. Is this right? If so, our democracy and world are in far graver trouble than I thought.

Laws don't enforce themselves, and fairness doesn't rule naturally. If no one fights for these bedrock principles, they will just wither away. Not to mention all the harm that is already transpiring from the cessation of these critical global programs.

InternationalDev,Message from Ken Jackson to USAID staff,"This was forwarded to me (an IP employee) and I thought other IP employees might find it worth reading. At the very least, there is recognition that foreign assistance will exist for decades to come: 

Msg sent to USAID staff —USAID Teammates,This past election, the American people sent a clear mandate: they expect a government that serves their interests. Over the past week, we have seen that our President is committed to delivering an America First policy. We have a responsibility to support the President in achieving his vision. This will require each of us to be flexible, to work at a pace we may not be accustomed to, to challenge the basic assumptions surrounding foreign aid, and to make decisions that ensure the United States becomes safer, stronger, and more prosperous.This past week, the Acting Administrator and Agency Front Office have provided significant guidance and instruction, covering everything from eliminating DEIA to providing direction on returning to in-person work. I appreciate your hard work so far. Nevertheless, we are just beginning to implement the President’s agenda, so there is a need for clear expectations going forward. First, the pause on all foreign assistance means a complete halt. Guidance provided specifies that the only exceptions to this pause are for emergency humanitarian food assistance and for government officials returning to their duty stations. The waiver for humanitarian food assistance is explicit—be prepared to provide detailed information and justification for any emergency humanitarian food assistance delivered during the current review period.Second, a waiver process for any expenditures beyond emergency humanitarian food assistance is in place. All requests for waivers will go through designated leaders and must be approved by me and the Director for Foreign Assistance before being submitted to the Secretary of State for final approval. Any waiver must be thoroughly justified to demonstrate that the specific assistance for which the waiver is sought is necessary for lifesaving purposes, cannot be performed by current U.S. direct hire staff, or would otherwise pose significant risks to national security.Third, as outlined in the President’s Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid, all foreign assistance programs will undergo a comprehensive review. More information about the review process and the criteria for determining whether programs will continue will be provided in the coming days. It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized.Fourth, all communications outside the Agency, including to the State Department, must be approved by the Agency Front Office.Finally, I want to emphasize how important these priorities are to the President and the American people who voted for an America First agenda. Failure to abide by this directive, or any of the directives sent out earlier this week and in the coming weeks, will result in disciplinary action. I will hold leaders accountable to ensure their employees adhere to these expectations.The President has given us a tremendous opportunity to transform the way we approach foreign assistance for decades to come. I hope each of you will roll up your sleeves and join me in making President Trump’s vision a reality.With gratitude,Ken Jackson Assistant to the Administrator for Management and Resources",https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1iafmjx/message_from_ken_jackson_to_usaid_staff/,2025-01-26 00:00:00,"USAID, foreign aid, foreign aid"
InternationalDev,I’m worried Trump’s admin is working to dismantle/dramatically shrink USAID,"I’ve been reflecting on State’s recent memo regarding foreign assistance, which you can read [here](https://bsky.app/profile/kenklippenstein.bsky.social/post/3lgiwkjeae22h)

They are going to review all active foreign assistance grants, contracts, and subcontracts to, “ensure that all foreign assistance is aligned with President Trump’s foreign policy agenda.” Every Bureau/office/entity providing foreign assistance has to provide a list and state how they think each one is advancing Trump’s agenda.

This feels ominous. It feels like the beginning of a massive restructuring. Does global health align with his agenda (especially for our colleagues in family planning, HIV/AIDS, and immunization)? Does gender equality? Does climate resilience? This feels like an excuse to cut entire offices.

Leaving out an exemption for institutional support contractors from the cable feels especially concerning. Maybe it was an oversight, but what if it was intentionally done to cripple USAID operations? 

It feels like they came way more prepared this time with a clear understanding of how this system works. If this is indeed a major restructuring, this will decimate an entire industry. It’s not just USAID employees - it’s implementing partners around the world. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Does anyone have reassurance or more insight into any checks and balances that exist to prevent this from happening?",https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1i9pbo7/im_worried_trumps_admin_is_working_to/,2025-01-25 00:00:00,USAID

I know the stop work order doesn’t impact everyone in the sector directly, but I believe it will have massive repercussions on aid as a whole. I work for a USAID contractor, and it’s super unclear right now what this means for our jobs, but I’m preparing for the worst. We know that our intentions for our work are noble, and while there are valid criticisms of US foreign aid, gutting an entire industry and potentially putting thousands of people out of work is not the right way to address those criticisms.

humanitarian,Collating and Crystallizing the Losses to USAID Global Health from the March 2 Enrich Memo,"I spent time this week collating the projected humanitarian losses shared in the memo leaked by Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for global health at USAID a week ago (""[U.S.A.I.D. Memos Detail Human Costs of Cuts to Foreign Aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/usaid-cuts-deaths-infections.html)"", *New York Times*, March 2).

**TLDR:** I've analyzed and extrapolated the leaked USAID memo data into a clear 4-page summary revealing **2.6-4.5 million annual deaths** globally, potential **15-38 million pandemic deaths**, and **$2-3 billion annual US costs**. My document organizes these impacts and adds strategic projections not found in the original. \[PDF link below\]

While the data was well-detailed in the leaked memo, it is still a little hard to get at, and did not include totals. Furthermore, there are certain extrapolations that can reasonably be made, to get to some idea of the projected losses.

I wanted to get as clear as possible about:

* Projected deaths globally
* Projected deaths in the U.S.
* Projected economic impacts in the U.S.

This gives us some basis to start *seeing* the magnitude of the damage, of what has been done.

What I did was use AI (Claude and ChatGPT, cross-compared), and then went through each number to double-check it (they did not make any mistakes, by the way). The AI was also able to do things like go into the footnotes and integrate information with related data in the tables to accurately add greater detail.

I end the document with a series of strategic projections about the damage done by these actions, and an easy-to-read set of cascading effect chains that clearly draw out the multiple layers of impact, without becoming overwhelming.

These can be used by journalists, aid workers, and regular citizens to surface more clarity and meaning around the damage done.

humanitarian,Foreign Aid Freeze on USAID,"The Trump Administration has implemented a freeze on all foreign us aid. This also includes all jobs that are contracted through USAID both in the US and internationally. Many people that I know and love are directly impacted by this. In addition, their jobs are on the line. I HIGHLY encourage you to please write a letter to your senators and representatives. Please see template below. 

Letter template:

Dear [Senator/Representative’s Last Name],  

I am writing as a concerned citizen and constituent regarding the recent stop-work order issued by the Trump administration and Secretary Marco Rubio, halting all USAID operations for 85 days. This unprecedented decision has devastating implications for U.S. foreign aid, global stability, and national security.  

As someone who believes in the importance of international cooperation and humanitarian efforts, I am alarmed by the ripple effects of this decision. USAID’s annual budget of approximately $30 billion supports vital programs in health, education, and economic development, benefiting millions of people in developing countries. These programs not only provide critical aid but also promote stability, reduce terrorism, and address migration pressures.  

The suspension of USAID operations impacts thousands of jobs, both in the United States and abroad. Local aid workers in developing countries will lose their income, violating labor laws in many of these nations and creating economic hardships for vulnerable communities. Additionally, this decision undermines decades of bipartisan efforts to promote global health and security, such as the successful PEPFAR program launched under President George W. Bush.  

Foreign aid is not just a moral imperative—it is a strategic investment in U.S. national security. By strengthening economies and providing alternatives to extremism and forced migration, USAID programs help to create a safer and more stable world for everyone.  

I urge you to stand against this decision and advocate for the immediate reversal of the stop-work order on USAID operations. Your leadership is critical in preserving the values and priorities that have long defined America’s role on the global stage.  

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I hope to see your support for restoring USAID’s vital work and safeguarding both global stability and U.S. interests.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]

globalhealth,"PEPFAR facing $3B in cuts, experts warn of 16M excess deaths by 2040","One of the most effective health programs ever created, the U.S.-funded PEPFAR initiative, is facing massive budget cuts under the FY 2026 federal budget proposal \[1\]. These cuts threaten to undo decades of progress, potentially leading to millions of preventable deaths.

PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) is the largest commitment by any nation to fight a single disease. Since 2003, by providing antiretroviral treatments and prevention programs (through education, condoms distribution and preventing transmission from mother to child)  it has:

* Saved an estimated over 25 million lives \[2\]  
* Reduced HIV-related mortality by up to 40% in many countries  
* Delivered treatment and prevention to millions of children and families

The President’s FY 2026 budget proposes:

* $1.9 billion in annual cuts to PEPFAR’s bilateral programs  
* An additional $1 billion in rescissions targeting already-approved global health funding \[3\]

Combined, all proposed cuts to global health programs would save the average (mean) American less than $30 per year, a rounding error in the federal budget (about 0.07%). But they could result in up to 16 million excess HIV-related deaths by 2040, according to UNAIDS and modeling by Georgetown University researchers \[4\].

These are evidence based programs with measurable impacts at an extremely high scale. If you live in the US, taking 5 minutes to send an email or call to your representatives can make a difference. Congressional offices log every message, and a small number of well-informed letters can shift priorities, especially when bipartisan programs like PEPFAR and other global health programs are on the line. A respectful message that signals you are part of the congressperson’s constituency (as far as you can without lying if they aren’t) can have a massive effect.

Here’s a link to find your senators/representative:  [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) 

I’m starting medical school at UCLA this fall, planning a career in global health. I’ve already contacted my senators and representative. If you care about reducing suffering as much as possible, this is one of the most consequential moments to act.

This seems really at odds with an America first agenda. Many farmers in the states are struggling and losing their farms due to federal funding cuts, but Trump wants to bring over 67,000 Afrikaners, many of which are farmers. American families are struggling working multiple jobs to put food on the table. Almost 60% of Americans feel financailly uncomfortable, with 34% living paycheck to paycheck. It seems like brining tens of thousands of foreigners in with potentiallly low skillsets would be terrible for Americans. Many of these farmers will need to recieve aid to fly over here, get housing, jobs, maybe retraining... basically welfare.

What do you think about this situation? Do you think if this were being reported in conservative news that it would be a popular idea? Doesn't it seem hypocritical to bring in tens of thousands of foreingers when we are supposed to be brining prices down and improving the cost of living for American citizens?

AskConservatives,"How do we respond to questions on supporting Israeli foreign policy, when we prefer non-intervention and less spending?","I know it's a paradox and honestly, I have been caught like a deer in the headlights a few times over it.

On one hand, non-intervention and less military spending make sense from a foreign policy and fiscal policy standpoint, if US interests are to be served and fiscal discipline is to be achieved (Next to Social Security and Medicare, the third trillion dollar budget mountain is Defense Spending). The argument is simple to make for a reason: What benefit does giving arms and money to others help US? Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many others in recent history have burned trillions without any returns on investment.

On the other hand, Conservatives and especially Religious/Social Conservatives have had a long history of supporting Israeli foreign policy. Heck, the funding sources of many Super PACs and think tanks that Conservatives rely on are heavily funded with Pro-Israel interests. It's similar to a marriage now that even when President Trump cut Foreign Aid, Israel was exempt. Not even the UK has this kind of reciprocal relationship, but it's hard to provide reasons without getting into problems.

Israel is one of the richest and most successful countries in the world and the $3.1B the US taxpayers give them is about .6% of their GDP so they could easily pay for this themselves

This old video of Netanyahu seems to indicate that even he has always been surprised at the level and dedication American support.  Even Trump exempted them from his foreign aid cuts.  I don't really understand why our tax dollars go to someone that doesn't even need it.  Bin Laden said this US support for Israel was the primary motivation of 911 which demonstrates there are 'cons' or risks to this support.

And there’s this one tree—shiny, gorgeous fruit, looks like it’s begging to be Instagrammed. God says, ‘Don’t touch it.’ Okay, fair. But then Eve enters the scene, fresh off the rib rack (imagine that baddie umekua ukimezea mate. eeeh! huyo sasa ndio eve wako) She’s already taken a bite, and she’s got that look in her eye, like, ‘C’mon, live a little.’ You’re telling me you’re gonna say no to her? the first woman your sorry ass has had the privilage of seeing?

Kenya,2027 Will Not Save You,"Think 2027 Will Be Fair? Think Again.

If you think the 2027 elections will run smoothly, cleanly, and according to the expected democratic script,you're in for a shock.

Picture this, you've hired a gardener to care for your beautiful garden. But instead of watering the plants, he dumps poison on the soil. Instead of pulling weeds, he uproots the healthiest flowers, clips blooming flowers, steps on the seedlings, cuts down the fruit trees, and scatters garbage across the garden. When pests show up, he invite more. When the grass starts to die, he paints it green and calls it healthy.

And when you confront him, he calmly says, ""Just be patient, it's all part of the plan"" or ""Trust the seasons, the soil will heal"".

Meanwhile, the roses wither, the plants dry out, and the once-thriving garden turns into a barren wasteland. Would you keep waiting, hoping for a miracle? Or would you replace the gardener before everything is beyond repair? Would you wait for their contract to end, or would you stop him before your garden turns to ruin? Would you let him ""finish the job""?

By 2027, the damage this country will have endured could be beyond anything we can currently imagine. Kenyans must learn to think critically, connect the dots, and read between the lines. The writing is already on the wall for those willing to see it.

Behind the scenes, dark plans are already in motion. While the country is preparing for free and fair elections, Ruto is engineering chaos. He is planning disorder because confusion is his cover, and crisis is his currency. While the public is planning for 2027, backroom deals are being made, systems are being tampered with, and loyal cronies are being quietly (and openly too, because they believe Kenyans are stupid. HA?!) installed in key positions.

MSM and commercial activists will air and flood us with fake doctored narratives as usual. Violence will be sparked in just the right places, at just the right time. Not by accident, but by design. Voter registers will mysteriously go missing. Ballots will vanish. Others will magically multiply. Legal institutions, meant to guard the process, will be either too compromised or too intimidated to act.

And when the dust settles, they'll look shocked, act confused, and call for unity after orchestrating the very divisions they now pretend to denounce. The cool-kidd here is tribalism or ""mirengo ya kisiasa"".

This isn't just about winning votes. It's about controlling the outcome no matter the cost. So no, the 2027 elections won't just be an event. They're shaping up to be a carefully staged spectacle of deception, distraction, and destruction.

So this psychopathic president has to go now, ASAP. HE MUST GO. His time is up. He has failed Kenyans. We must replace all current career politicians who have clung to power for decades, feeding off a broken system while the country suffers. We must break the cycle if we truly want a different future. This is a generational call to action. Gen-Z, Gen-Y and the awake among Gen-X, because this is our moment. Boomers should sit this one out. We already know how most of them will think, don't we?

EDIT:  
**I'm not condemning voting**. I believe in the power and responsibility of the vote. Unfortunately, ""*thinking*"" is probably a taboo for majority of Kenyan voters and they will elect anything with emotions without second-thought. But what I'm saying is this: ***waiting until 2027 to vote out this madman, assuming the process even succeeds, will be far too late for the country. By then, the damage may be irreversible.*** Institutions will be damaged, systems compromised, and public trust shattered beyond repair.

Constitutionally or other mechanisms, I believe he has to be **ousted** before the next election. otherwise the survival of our country is hinged on a rigged finish line. Contested elections are a recipe for disaster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1le77xe/2027_will_not_save_you/,2025-06-18 03:37:26,Feed the Future
Kenya,Utakufa vibaya wewe,"Apparently, our nephew(5M) is a certified sponge.

Usually, my nephew takes 2 to 3 hours to finish a meal. It's problematic. We have tried almost everything apart from force feeding him a certain way that traumatised the 7 year old I was.

So, while he's having lunch and I'm having a late late brunch, the nanny come to me and tells me that my nephew just prophesied her death?

I proceed to ask what happened. She proceeds to say that she was watching tv, he went and whispered to her ear, ""Utakufa vibaya wewe!"" 

Left her there stunned and proceeded to continue playing.

This alarms her because in her tradition, if a child so much as to say so and so died, they are gonna die in the next soon or someone close to so and so will kick the bucket.

So this has bugged her for almost the whole day.
Wondering what she's gonna do and who could possibly be sick in her family.

My sister and I, obviously after laughing, we proceed to tell her not to worry and that it's a meme, and that he prolly picked it from my brother who is constantly using it.

And then we explain the whole context and that it's not that his smart-ass saw anything from the future.

I'm not sure if her mind is eased tho. 

And the menace boy is still eating his lunch as naandika!

Kenya,do you think it's a conspiracy,"I was just sitting and thinking about how fast the world is advancing in terms of technology and infrastructure. The conspiracy is that the more we move forward on this path, the harder it becomes to access wealth and become rich(especially if you already poor) but before that money abundance is going to be felt and then BOOM everything will be moderate, all this is to enrich the governments,

... let me explain, I know sina extensive information kenye inaweza explain this but I think I see it, as Africans our knowledge and skills have been of great part of this advancement but it's hard for people to see it, mostly because of how certain things are presented or who gets credit for them.

We recently saw the rise of AI, and now many countries are putting major effort into automation, robotics, and so on. I know this is progress and it’s good but my concern is that there’s no uniformity. These robots will be built in certain countries, they will become more stable, and eventually, large populations especially most countries in AFrica might no longer be needed.

This is bad because imagine mse atume robots ka thao ziwauwe huku, I know ni funny but nyi mliona kenye ilihappen Palestine plus nmkua X and those people really hate us plus kenye ilihappen Zimbabwe(Rhodesia) at first I thought maybe those guys couldn't feed themselves kumbe hao wazungu walipoison those farms this is how evil those people are, but sometimes its confusing because you can't really say wanatuchukia hivo I mean they send aids and you can apply for a VISA and they will give you and so many other good things.

Anyway, my real concern is that big companies can afford to buy robots that work for them, giving them a huge advantage. ku-compete at that level itakua ngumu, which means it’s going to be harder and harder for ordinary people to get rich.

It feels like the gap between the powerful and the rest of us is only going to widen not because we’re lazy or incapable, but because the game is being redefined I mean we are providing information to them so that it can be used against us. weh imagine mse ame-disappear mysteriously and you can't provide evidence wacha hata hio, imagine uongee kitu ya ujinga alafu Ruto afinye tu button na kichwa yko i-explode, hio place nilisema story na uniformity I think AFricans being the most rich continent we need to get our sh\*t together so that we don't be weak in future when it comes to protecting ourselves and our resources and we are not there yet plus there's no signs which scares me, I would have continued but hii thread imekua long

Kenya,Betrayal or misunderstood intentions?,"A farmer bought a chick from a market. He fed it, took care of it, in no time it had grown into an adult chicken. The chicken was fond of the farmer, loved him like he was it's mother. The farmer had a guest pay him a visit at his home. Happy to see the visitor, he decided to prepare him a  scrumptious meal. The chicken saw the farmer sharpening a knife and grovelled towards him, happy to see him. He just grabbed it by the neck, chicken in shock, and decapitated it.
In that short period of time the chicken was in shock, it wondered why suddenly the farmer had changed.
The chicken in a state of confusion, misunderstood the farmer's intentions to care for it, feeding it for love. The farmer's true intentions was to rear, fatten it so as in the future he may eat it. Not for entertainment, companionship but to consume it. That was it's value to him.

Kenya,A Short Story.,"In Medicine, there's something called physical examination of the patient. Here, we usually comment on a patient's general appearance, to establish how affected the patient is. Sometimes they're fatigued and dizzy, and other times they're just bearing the pain silently. 

Now. Today, we happened to meet an Intern Doctor who had some serious family issues, and is quite dependent on cannabis, though not that much. Sasa, there's a lady in labor that we had to examine, to establish how favorable the cervix was before induction of labor. 

The intern folded the sleeves of his white coat, and started off. The issue is that while scoring the cervix, all you need is a speculum and sterile gloves. The consultant was there as well. This Intern goes ahead to comment on the lady's general appearance rather than examining the cervix. He said, ""The woman is suffering.""🤣🤣🤣 He could have said she was in distress or something.

Vile alisema ndio shida. It's like he was from Uganda. Imagine Museveni saying that same statement with a Ugandan accent🤣🤭 

Heh! The consultant scratched his head, and that's when the Intern fumbled again. He removed his gloves, and turned then inside out, and wore them again. He buttoned his shirt, pulled up his tie. My friend whispered to me ati the guy was high🤣 She had seen him outside the washrooms akishikisha uzito🤣🤣🤣

Kenya,"🇰🇪 Why Is Kenya So Spiritually Important,And Why Are We Being ""Preserved""?","Lately I’ve been thinking hard.
With everything going on in Kenya;the rising cost of living, police brutality, youth unrest, and this heaviness in the air,it feels like there’s more happening than meets the eye.

Why is it that Kenya has never been put on harsh travel bans, even when other East African countries were targeted?
Why did the new Pope visit Kenya months before his election?
Why is there this suspicious peace the world seems to have with Kenya?

Could it be because Kenya is not just another African country?

Let me explain:

🔑 There’s Something Deeper About This Land:

Mt. Kenya (Kirinyaga) is believed to be the home of God (Ngai) in Kikuyu tradition. That’s not just myth,it’s power.

The Rift Valley literally splits the continent, but spiritually, it’s like a sacred scar running through our land.

Elders say this land has strong ancestral energy,you can feel it in the trees, rivers, hills, and stones.

Before colonizers came, people did ceremonies on specific land points;spiritual gates. Then, the British built churches right on top of those sacred sites.

They knew.

✋🏾 And Yet, Look at What’s Going On:

Kenya is a UN headquarters, a US drone base, and a hub for global surveillance.

The world watches us but doesn't move against us. You don’t “crush” a place you still plan to use.

So maybe Kenya is being “spared” not out of mercy,but because it’s too important to the systems at play.

So I ask:

Could it be that Kenya holds a deeper purpose?
Are we sitting on an ancient energy gate?
Is that why we’re being watched,but not destroyed?

Dr. Mumbi once said, ""Kenya is the spiritual heart of Africa."" I believe her.

Because I’ve felt it. Maybe you’ve felt it too,the pull, the awakening.

🔮 What if our ancestors knew something the world forgot?

What if the energy here can’t be colonized forever?

What if our generation is meant to reclaim it spiritually, mentally, and politically?


I want to connect with anyone who’s been thinking like this.
If you know anything;books, links, elders, TikToks, even dreams,let’s talk.

This isn’t conspiracy. It’s memory.

Kenya isn’t sleeping. She’s remembering.🌿

Kenya,To our leaders;," To the Leaders of Africa: There is a storm rising. And it will not wait for protocol.
You have stolen enough. Enriched yourselves, your friends, and your families while the people who put you in power sleep on empty stomachs. Every time your private jets take to the skies, remember: the cost of just one hour in the air can feed 100 hungry families,families you were sworn to protect, not starve. The fuel that powers your endless convoys could carry the struggling citizen to work for an entire month. Yet you burn it like it means nothing. You flaunt wealth as if the suffering eyes watching you from the roadside do not matter,as if the dust they choke on while your luxury cars speed past will never turn into fire. But hear this clearly: the poor you rob to feed your greed are not blind. They are hungry. And when a people have nothing left to eat, they will eat the rich.
You send wealth to foreign banks, to London and Dubai, as if those vaults will shelter your children when your country falls. You invest abroad while your country decays beneath your feet,forgetting that no western savings account can save a nation on the brink. In the end, your foreign investments will not preserve you; they will bury the country you are meant to lead. And soon, even those investments will lose value, just like the trust your people once had in you. You are not gods. You are not untouchable. You are public servants. And the patience of the poor has limits.

Kenya,We're standing at a cliff's edge,"Good evening, fellow Kenyans...
.It just hit me that we're standing on the precipice of great change in this country. With the newly proposed finance bill, it looks like there's gonna be some serious protests, followed by extra judicial killings.

Oh wait, I've seen this before. It was last year. Currently it looks like we're in a repetitive cycle where the government keeps forcing us to tighten our belts some more, then we protest and they withdraw a few steps but move forward by a mile in the next financial year.

The national debt is at 11.36 trillion, having increased by a trillion per year since the new regime came into power but what do we have to show for it?

Nothing, absolutely nothing. Are the services that we're paying for working? Where are the cheap houses that we were promised? All I see is estates for the bourgeois in the outskirts of the capital. Serenity in Rongai is a good example.

Apparently Kibra is going to be the biggest estate in Africa, but what are the plans for it's current residents?

Too many issues to touch on but what can Mwanainchi do? Go protest for a couple of weeks then the government retreats only to advance their agenda later.

In short, it's an era which shall be defined by the revolution for the better or we sink into a total dictatorship where democracy is but a pipe dream.

Call me out for this but I think the Jayden era was a good one, we didn't even care for things like the finance bill, ignorance was bliss. 

Right now we're living in fear of what might happen to us if we're outspoken in criticism against the government. Just you wait till the bill passes and the government has all your personal information regardless of the anonymity of some social media platforms.

Kenya,"I think colonialism is just a convenient excuse, when it comes to how & why we favor colonizers and give them preferential treatment over our fellow black/Africans.","

Let's have a discussion. Colonialism ended 60+ yrs ago. That means that anyone 60 and below didn't experience colonialism. The effects - Colonialism ended but effects are still alive. This comment is usually thrown around casually. So let's unpack it. What effects are we talking really about?

Let's talk from an example of a twenty-or-thirty-year-old customer care server allowing colonizers to jump the queue at the bank, or guards only searching locals and similar form of preferential treatment and discrimination to locals. This happens a lot! The worst place I have seen this is Safaricom shop. Everyone is queing, and out of nowhere comes a colonizer and immediately the agents starts attending to them, whilst thirty locals have been waiting for hours.  

 If its in Europe, the reverse would happen. I have seen it alot in government building. You are queuing in a government office in Frankfurt waiting for service, then a local comes and is served before you, sometimes it's not one or two people. They will jump the queue for their own people and lie to you straight in the face that his/hers was a priority because they're needed for work, they have a family or other dumb excuse. Point is, they will always put their own before anyone else. Back in Africa it's the complete opposite, we not only treat our own poorly, but commit an injustice and give a preferential service to outsiders.

Yet, you will time from time see colonialism taking the blame whenever there is an incidents arise. If not colonialism, it's it's effects. Colonialism ended 60+ yrs ago. Is it really sincere to continue blaming colonialism or its supposed effects? More importantly, what exact effect are we really talking about? Because it is really misused.

Colonialism in Africa utilised brutalism and physical force, rather than mental/psychological tools or soft power. They used hard power:  guns and violence to suppress resistance and take power. Colonizers were also not interested in creating a favourable perception or image of themselves. They ruled with iron fist: absolute violence, forced labor and land theft. Even for the tribes that collaborated, Africans saw colonizers as oppressors. Collaboration was mainly from a place of fear. So, no one wanted them to stay.  So, there was absolutely no admiration for them. There was no room for any positive emotions nor perceptions towards Europeans. So, what or which effect of colonialsm would make a black African treat their own poorly, and favor the son or daughter of the colonizer sixty year later?

In contrast, in some places in Asia and Latin America, Europeans invaders utilized a different strategy: psychological tools, soft power, propaganda to indoctrinate masses using white supremacist ideologies and plant a favourable opinion and perception in the minds of the natives. The main idea was to manipulate natives into accepting the invaders and view them as emancipatory, rather than oppressors. The subliminal messaging was Europeans were coming to help them overcome systematic challenges and create advancement/development. They had very positive perceptions of colonialsm. Good example is Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore. 

Also, there were no television, mobile phones or radios that would assumebly be used to indoctrinate people with white supremacist notions, European beauty standards push or trigger inferiority complex amongst Africans. 

I find it extremely insincere, downright deceitful and sneaky escapism to attribute colonialism as the cause of poor treatment of fellow Africans and preferential treatment of colonizers. It is a quick and easy means to avoid self introspection, accountability. Saying colonialsm is the cause is rather a more of a convenience to absolve ourselves of moral failures. 


You know, on the surface it's not such a big deal. But looking at it from a psychological, instinctual and survival perspective, it's such a deeply fucked utopian shit. Completely abnormal and hostile behaviour towards ourselves, and our survival as a collective.

Kenya,If I Could Only Share One Piece of Advice: Why Betting on Yourself Beats Everything Else,"Saw a post here on Reddit where someone asked:
“What’s one skill you don’t regret learning?”

My Honest answer? Every single one.

Even the ones that didn’t pay. Even the ones that led to dead ends. Even the ones I learned out of pure survival mode.

Because each one taught me something about myself—and somehow, they’ve all come full circle.

I joined uni to study Construction Engineering. You know, that classic “My son is doing engineering” line parents love to parade at chama meetings. Deep down though? I knew I was lying to myself. No passion. No curiosity. Just burnout. By end of 2nd year, I was mentally and emotionally tapped out. Don't joke with Structures.

Then TikTok did its thing.

Elvis Warutomo popped up on my For You page talking about online skills. That one video lit something in me.

I started with email marketing on Hubspot academy. Got certified. Went crazy with cold outreach—over 1,000 DMs and emails.Switched to various nitches; beauty, real estate, fitness , health, Saas and many others. I was hungry. But not a single gig after one full year.(Had to go to mjengo to survive)

So I switched lanes. Taught myself frontend dev on FreeCodeCamp—HTML, CSS, JS. Still, no clients. Zero traction.

Then I picked up Python. Mosh on YouTube became my virtual mentor. I didn’t finish the course, but luckily life threw me into AI training jobs on Remotasks and Outlier. I did my part for cents, but the money helped me stay afloat.

Somewhere along the way, I discovered copywriting. Didn’t take it seriously at first—just something to pass time. But it unlocked a new way of thinking. I even dabbled in business strategy and marketing. Started imagining what it’d look like to run something of my own someday.

I took that knowledge and grew my LinkedIn to around 1,570 followers—organically. No ads, just consistency.

Eventually, a 4th-year Software Engineer friend needed help with his final project. I helped built him a full POS system using Python and some business logic. Combined everything I’d learned. I didn’t get paid, but he passed with flying colors. That win? Mine too.

Then crypto entered the chat.

I’d been slowly accumulating Pepe—every dip, I added a little. $10 here, $5 there. I don’t save. I invest. If money sits, it rots.

Pepe pumped from around $0.000006 to $0.00002850 within a certain period of time. I exited at 0.000021. Pocketed around $400 profit.(Took about 5 —7 months) Cashed out $150 to handle bills and bought TON at around $6-8.

Then the bear came.

TON tanked to $3. I panicked and sold. What was left? Just $77.

But instead of folding, I had been studying margin trading on YouTube. Understood the risk. Watched every isolated margin explainer I could find. Learned about leverage. Volume. Momentum.

Then came a weird night.

Some guy on TradingView—goes by Xanos—posted saying BTC would dump at $84,500. I’d followed him long enough to know… he’s usually wrong. The man is basically a contrarian signal.

I checked the charts. Volume was strong. Buyers were hungry.

So I did the craziest thing—I threw that $77 into a 125x leveraged long.

Then I turned off my phone. And slept.

Woke up to BTC at $87,000.

Account? Sitting at around $360.

In one night, I’d bounced back. 

And yo, I almost didn’t make it to that moment.


A while back, I hit rock bottom. So desperate, I almost gave in to carding. My curiosity took over, and I started studying it. I’m great at finding valuable resources, so I hunted down some leaked courses, found them, and spent days learning the ins and outs. I even met a random guy online who was selling non-VBV cards—and for a moment, I actually considered it. I was that low.

(BEWARE 90% of càrd sellers online are scammers aiming to drain your pockets)

I won’t lie—there’s a part of me that still carries anger toward the systems that messed us up. Colonization didn’t just take our land, it buried generations of potential. Sometimes, I feel like scamming the system back would be justice.

But deep down, I know my ancestors didn’t fight so I could lose myself in shortcuts. That’s not power. That’s desperation disguised as rebellion.

So I stepped away. I want to win clean. Build slow. But build real.

Funny twist—I met a cybersecurity expert at a burial. We vibed. Now I’m back on the learning path , I'm now locked in for the next six months with a small crew of like-minded bros. We're building again. Quietly, but surely.

Still, the mental toll has been real.

I’ve been through depression. Sleepless nights. Felt useless. Hopeless. And don’t even get me started on dating in this generation—love feels like a marketing scam now. I had to fall back and heal first. My peace comes first.

And honestly? I realized most of my anxiety came from worrying about a future that hadn’t even happened. So I decided to live in the now. Control what I can. Leave the rest to the Divine.

I don’t fully know who I am yet. But I know this:

I’m a firstborn son. Middle-class background. Parents aging. Siblings looking up to me. Pressure's real. I carry it daily. And still—I refuse to break. Never will.

One day I’ll look back at this post and smile. Because I know I’ll make it. I have to.

Kenya needs healing. Africa needs rebuilding. But before I save anyone else—I’ve got to save me and my people first.

Maybe we need another maandamano to let this pain out, lol. If you know, you know.

Anyway—I pray you reading this make it too.

Because everyone’s fighting a battle they don’t post about. So please, don’t worry too much about tomorrow. Do what you can today. Let the universe meet you halfway.

I’m not where I want to be, but I’m not where I was.

So as long as I’m growing—mentally, physically, spiritually—I’m winning.

And so are you.

If you ever get a money-making plug, don’t hoard it. Share it. That’s how we all rise. The bag is infinite for all of us. Mama told me that. I believe her.

Money is energy. When you share a way to earn it, the universe returns the favor. Always.

Kenya,"The undeniable, haunting truth, one so evil, you can’t begin to grasp it, lurks far beyond what you think you know.","I may not fully agree with Dagoretti MP KJ Kiarie on everything, especially his defensive stance regarding KDF soldiers during the Finance Bill protests and the recent BBC exposé but I must say, I stand with him on what he said about BATUK soldiers.

Having lived in Nanyuki from the age of 14 to 21 a solid seven years I’ve seen things that still unsettle me. And if you believe you've encountered evil, allow me to tell you this: whatever you've faced is merely a shadow compared to what British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) soldiers have done in that town.

The horror stories are not just whispers. These are well-documented crimes articles of rape, assault, and even murder, mostly targeting vulnerable women, particularly sex workers. At one point, the situation got so bad that their own commander had to caution them against sleeping with too many local women because they were contracting STIs. an article on the rape stories  was covered by journalist Larry Madowo in CNN’s report: [CNN article](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/17/africa/british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl).

Another troubling read is from Leigh Day, shedding light on how sexual violence against women persists wherever the British army sets up shop: [Leigh Day article](https://www.leighday.co.uk/news/blog/elimination-of-violence-against-women/sexual-violence-against-women-where-the-british-army-trains-in-kenya-continues-to-be-reported/) and so many if you just search BATUK soldiers in Kenya on google. 

And let us never forget Agnes Wanjiru. She was just 21 when she vanished in March 2012. Last seen with British soldiers in a Nanyuki hotel bar, her body was found two months later in a septic tank. And to make things worse, those soldiers went online and laughed about it. That is not just criminal it is inhumane.

Sometimes I wonder: are we really free as a country? Because how else do you justify the continued presence of a UK military base in Kenya when we have our own defense forces? It reeks of neocolonialism, our land, our people, still being disrespected in ways that echo colonial violence and not just Kenya. All African countries have colonial military base. 

No matter where you stand politically, these truths cannot be ignored.

  
If any African claims the continent is free from colonization, I say this with all due respect  that’s dumb. We're not free; we’re just no longer in visible chains. 

That’s the only difference. Colonial power never left,  it simply changed form. Yes, you heard me right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kctjgx/the_undeniable_haunting_truth_one_so_evil_you/,2025-05-02 05:38:35,Power Africa

But instead of sulking, I hopped on a local bus and unknowingly unlocked one of the most real, unfiltered, and unexpectedly powerful road trips I’ve ever had in Kenya.

From random stops and DJ-style bus entertainment, to scenic views and a front-row seat to the hustle of everyday Kenyans — this ride reminded me why public transport is a cultural experience of its own. And guess what? I still made it to Taita *before* the train. 😂

Kenya,The BBC documentary,"So if you haven’t watched it i will give a brief: 

The BBC Africa Eye documentary Blood Parliament investigates the tragic events of June 25, 2024, when Kenyan security forces(national police service +KDF) opened fire on peaceful Gen Z protesters outside Parliament. 

The protest, sparked by opposition to the controversial Finance Bill, ended in bloodshed as both police and KDF officers used live ammunition, resulting in several deaths and injuries. 
Through verified videos, forensic analysis, and witness accounts, the documentary identifies specific officers involved in the gross murders .I literally cried during the documentary. 

The ironical part is that the police is supposed to serve and protect not the opposite. I think genuinely officers should be taken through a psychological evaluation if you aren’t  highly emotionally intelligent don’t get the power and the weapon.

Kenya,The genesis of Africa’s developmental challenge,"The main challenge with Africa isn’t that there aren’t resources or that Africans are some how inferior to other places or peoples:

It’s that African elites don’t see the need to invest in their people. They find it more profitable to extort and exploit citizens and live as second class citizens in other people’s capitals in Europe and America.

Countries don’t develop because the people are special or they run into some huge sum of money. Countries develop when the political elites and economic elites to decide to extend their power for purposes that improve the quality of life for fellow citizens. This hasn’t happened in Africa in general, and worse off in non democracies.

So the question is not whether Africa should pursue a Chinese model or an American model. It about a political culture and institutional culture that forces both the economic and political class to see the benefit of investing in their respective countries, so that they would good for themselves in the process. The cost of underdevelopment should hurt them first.

Economic models like state led, free enterprise, or mixed methods often lead to the same outcome without a change in the political culture of the society.

We have a culture problem. And it’s not a culture of being less than as Africans, it’s a culture of exploitation, arrogance, and limited faith in ourselves or our people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k6tjib/the_genesis_of_africas_developmental_challenge/,2025-04-24 14:25:08,Power Africa

Kenya,Islam and the end times- Here is Wisdom,"There is a compelling case — often overlooked or dismissed — that Islam may be the religion from which the Antichrist emerges, or through which his system is empowered. Consider the following:

**Denial of Christ’s Divinity and Sacrifice**  
Islam is the only major world religion that explicitly and vehemently denies that Jesus is the Son of God. In fact, it makes this denial a core doctrine. The Qur’an states that saying ""God has a son"" is a grievous sin, worthy of eternal punishment. The religion also explicitly denies that Christ dies and posits a replacement theory that says God switched Christ with Judas, thus invalidating the Sacrifice upon which the whole of Christianity is based. This direct contradiction of Christian belief aligns eerily with the biblical description of the Antichrist as one who denies the Father, the Son (1 John 2:22) and disturbingly specifically denies the exact belief you need for Salvation, the belief that Jesus is the Son of God and God gave His Son to die for your Sins. That is not coincidence- that's prophecy unfolding.

**Execution of Christians by Beheading**  
Revelation 20:4 describes the method of execution of saints during the Great Tribulation at the end time as Beheading. While many regimes e.g. China, have persecuted Christians, Islam is uniquely and consistently associated with beheading, both historically and currently. It’s not only practiced — it’s defended as religiously justified. The most recent beheadings in Congo of 70 Christians are an illustration of this method. Not a coincidence.

**A Political-Religious System**  
Islam isn’t merely a personal faith — it is also a political ideology, with a history of merging religion and state power. TSee Iran and Turkey and most of Middle East. \]he concept of the Ummah (global Islamic community under one caliphate) reflects the sort of unified religious-political structure that would be required to control commerce, impose global edicts, and carry out widespread persecution, as described in Revelation. We have already had a preview of this with ISIS and how rapidly and widely it united muslims once the idea of a Caliphate was announced. And we saw exactly a preview of what is coming in the future.

**The Mahdi: A Mirror of the Antichrist**  
Islamic eschatology includes the rise of a powerful leader known as the Mahdi, who will unite the Muslim world, establish justice, and rule for seven years — eerily similar to the biblical Antichrist. Some interpretations even expect him to work with Isa (the Islamic Jesus) to break crosses, kill pigs, and abolish Christianity as it is known — a narrative that mirrors persecution of believers during the end times:

* **Mahdi**: Expected to rise as a global ruler who unites the Muslim world and establishes a just Islamic caliphate. | **Antichrist**: Will rise as a global leader with unprecedented authority and power, establishing a political system that dominates the world.
* **Mahdi**: Many Islamic traditions say he will rule for **seven years** before the Day of Judgment. | **Antichrist**: In Christian prophecy, the Antichrist confirms a **seven-year covenant** (Daniel 9:27), during which he rules — with the latter half marked by extreme persecution.
* **Mahdi**: Will lead military campaigns to conquer enemies of Islam, including Christians and Jews. | **Antichrist**: Will engage in global warfare, conquering nations and beheading saints.
* **Mahdi**: Will conquer Jerusalem and establish Islamic rule there, possibly even overseeing a new temple or mosque on the Mount. | **Antichrist**: Enters the rebuilt temple, proclaims himself divine, and desecrates it (the “abomination of desolation”).

**The Dajjal: A Mirror of Christ**  
In Islamic eschatology, the Dajjal is the ultimate deceiver — a false messiah who will claim divinity, perform miracles, and lead people astray. Yet, when viewed through a Christian prophetic lens, this figure's traits align not with the Antichrist, but uncannily with the returning Jesus Christ:

* **Dajjal:** Will claim to be divine and demand allegiance from all who see him. | **Christ**: Returns as King of Kings, claiming full divine authority (Matthew 28:18) and receiving global worship (Revelation 5:13).
* **Dajjal:** Performs great signs — including killing and appearing to raise the dead — to deceive the masses. | **Christ:** Will return in power and glory, resurrecting the dead and judging all mankind (John 11:25, Revelation 20:12).
* **Dajjal:** Said to travel the world, deceiving people, but unable to enter Mecca and Medina. | **Christ:** Will descend visibly upon His return and gather His elect from the ends of the earth (Matthew 24:30–31).

If the enemy can flip the script so convincingly that the world welcomes the Antichrist as a messiah and rejects Jesus as a deceiver, it would be the ultimate spiritual trap. Especially if that script pre-programs 2 billion people to reject anyone claiming divine authority,- epecially someone coming to Jerusalem and especially someone confronting their peaceful world ruler (Mahdi). It is perfect or as close to perfect as can be.

**The Abomination that Causes Desolation in the Holy Place**  
Islam’s longstanding claim over Jerusalem — especially the Temple Mount — positions it at the center of a specific end-times desecration, called the ""abomination that causes desolation"" by Daniel and by Jesus as a pre-requisite for triggering the final countdown. Given what happened on October 7th, one can easily envision a scenario in which, after a perceived victory over Israel, an Islamic force storms the temple mount and commits one or both of the following two abominations:

1. Commits a slaughtering of Jews that take refuge in the temple or its ruins, and in a macabre display like we have seen previous extremist groups do to churches in conflict zones, desecrates the temple with the corpses of Jews and Christians. see ISIS.
2. Converts the ruins of the Jewish Temple into a Mosque — as a final mark of their Victory. Similar to the attempt of muslims to build a mosque at the site of the Twin Towers attack.

**Numbers and Influence**  
Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world, with over 1.9 billion adherents and growing influence in Africa, Europe, and Asia. It possesses not just the theological components, but also the numerical strength and momentum to fulfill large-scale tribulation and domination — especially in a future global crisis.

**Historical and Doctrinal Hostility to Jews and Christians**  
The Qur’an contains verses that express deep enmity toward Jews and Christians, and some Islamic scholars have interpreted these as a basis for hostility. While many Muslims live peacefully, the doctrinal undercurrent allows for violent persecution, particularly in the context of global jihad and end-time conflict narratives.

**Jizya: A System of Religious Oppression**  
In Islamic law, non-Muslims (especially Jews and Christians) living under Muslim rule must pay the jizya tax — a financial penalty imposed for simply refusing to convert. The jizya system creates a second-class status and fulfills, in spirit, Revelation 13’s warning of a world where people cannot ""buy or sell"" without submission to the system of the Beast.

**Gift Giving: A minor detail easy to overlook**

Revelation 11:10 describes an eerie global reaction to the death of the Two Witnesses, God's end-time prophets:

>The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth

After the 9/11 attacks, there was documented footage in parts of the Palestinian territories showing people dancing, singing, handing out sweets, and giving gifts to celebrate what they believed was a strike against their enemies. Children were filmed receiving candy. The mood was festive, not solemn.

Similar scenes have played out after terrorist attacks on Israelis, with families celebrating and distributing sweets in places like Gaza and parts of Lebanon. In some cases, people declared victory from mosque loudspeakers.

This ritualistic celebration of death, complete with gift-giving, is deeply symbolic — and matches exactly what Revelation describes. It is not found in communist regimes, atheist states, or even among Western secularists. We’ve only seen modern-day previews of this in one particular cultural context: radical Islamic societies.

Kenya,The ICC,"Sometimes, the most important question to ask is simply: why?
We often hear people say, ""The ICC was created to try African leaders,"" but rarely do we pause and ask: why would Europe need a court to try African war criminals? What real stake do they have in, say, someone getting their hands chopped off in Liberia?

The answer we’re usually given is ""human rights."" But let’s be honest—after everything we’ve seen, that’s starting to look more like a smokescreen than a serious motive.

Take this example:
In the 1970s, North Korea ordered about 1,000 Volvos from Sweden. Then they just... didn’t pay. Completely ghosted Sweden. To this day, Volvo is still chasing that debt, but there’s little they can do. And the rest of Europe noticed.

Fast forward to the 1990s—globalization is surging, especially across Asia. But the memory of those unpaid Volvos still lingered. European powers realized that for globalization to work, there needed to be some form of enforceable international justice. Something to stop countries from simply ignoring agreements, debts, or judgments.

That’s where the International Criminal Court (ICC) comes in. Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which rules on state-to-state matters, the ICC was designed to try individuals. Why? Because after the ICJ ruled against the U.S. in the Nicaragua v. USA case (1986), and the U.S. just ignored it, it became clear: ""might is right"" in global politics. But that mindset is incompatible with a truly globalized world.

Still, they couldn’t realistically prosecute Western leaders—it would undermine the very powers setting the system up. And Asia? Not an option either:

- Most Asian countries didn’t ratify the ICC treaty.

- Europe was courting Asia for trade and diplomacy; prosecuting their leaders would risk alienating them.


That left Africa and Latin America. And Africa, with ongoing conflicts and weaker political leverage, became the ideal testing ground.
Many African states were easily pressured into signing the Rome Statute and even arresting their own people, especially in the early 2000s. Thus, the ICC had its early ""examples""—not as a universal court of justice, but as a geopolitical tool to demonstrate that international law had teeth when applied selectively.

The ICC was not born purely out of a love for human rights. Its emergence was shaped by geopolitical needs in a globalizing world, especially after previous institutions like the ICJ proved ineffective against powerful nations. Africa became the stage for this new form of “justice,” not because it was the most in need of it—but because it was the most convenient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtj0kt/the_icc/,2025-04-07 11:31:26,Power Africa
Kenya,Tech bros & sis! What’s the best path now? Moringa? ALX? Or self-taught?,"Hey fam! So I’ve been diving into tech lately — trying to learn as much as I can. I started from YouTube (yep, the free university) and I’ve already picked up quite a bit:

Kenya,From the same man talking of austerity measures.,"
By Edwin Nyarangi | May 6, 2025

When President William Ruto formed the government, he promised to reduce the number of presidential advisers as part of his austerity measures.

However, Ruto now has at least 20 advisers with some of them serving at the level of Cabinet Secretaries while others are at the level of Principal Secretaries, gobbling up more than Sh1 billion to run their offices annually.

The question being raised is whether the President needs all these advisers, yet he has Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and technocrats in the relevant ministries who are best suited to perform most of the duties assigned to the advisors.

“The number of advisers in my administration is going to be reduced by 50 per cent with immediate effect as part of the austerity measures that we are carrying out in government,” said Ruto in July last year after the Gen Z protests forced him to dissolve the Cabinet.

In less than one year, however, the presidential advisers have increased from about seven to 20, with more likely to join the team, especially with the broad-based arrangement in which the ruling Kenya Kwanza coalition is working with the ODM party.

This is a stark contrast to former President Mwai Kibaki, who had only three advisers during his second term, who included Prof Kivutha Kibwana, the adviser on constitutional and youth affairs and Raphael Tuju, who served as the adviser on media affairs.

Ruto’s advisers include: Makau Mutua, Moses Kuria, David Ndii, Monica Juma, Karisa Nzai, Edward Kisiangani, Joseph Boinnet, Jaoko Oburu, Silvester Kasuku, Harriette Chiggai, Ali Somane, Abdi Guliye, Steven Otieno, Dominic Menjo, Nancy Laibuni, Augustine Cheruiyot, Kennedy Ogeto, Mohammed Hassan, Henry Kinyua and Joe Ager.

Prof Mutua who is the latest to join the Ruto administration after being appointed as a senior adviser for constitutional affairs, is a longtime ally of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and has served as his political adviser for many years.

Mutua is a distinguished Kenyan-American scholar who is a professor of law known for his contributions to international human rights and law journals and has been remembered as a harsh critic of Ruto who has previously vowed never to work in his administration.

Kuria is former Cabinet Secretary in the Ruto administration and a former MP for Gatundu South and currently serves as a senior adviser in the Council of Economic Advisers to the President. Ndii is a renowned Kenyan economist, author and columnist widely recognised for his contributions to economic policy and governance. He is known for controversial posts on his X account sometimes satirically supporting sleaze. He serves as the chairperson of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.

Kisiang’ani is an academician and political commentator who served as Principal Secretary for Broadcasting and Telecommunications, with his tenure mired in controversy, where media houses accused him of interfering with press freedom.

Ruto reassigned Kisiang’ani as a senior adviser to the Council of Economic Advisers following a sustained media onslaught accusing him of overstepping his mandate by creating a monopoly in the allocation of government advertisement to the media.

Juma currently holds the position of National Security Adviser to the President and previously served as a Cabinet Secretary during Uhuru’s second term and a Principal Secretary in Uhuru’s first term in office.

Boinnet served as the second Inspector General of Police up to 2019 and was appointed by Ruto in 2023 as the Deputy National Security Adviser in the Office of the President, which makes him assistant to Juma.

Jaoko is a special adviser on economic empowerment and sustainable livelihoods. He is a son of Siaya Senator Oburu Odinga. 

Kasuku serving as governance adviser is an expert with more 24 years of experience in transport, infrastructure, urban planning and regional integration with significant leadership roles in government, academia and consultancy.

Chiggai, who is currently serving as the adviser on women’s rights, is a prominent lawyer known for her dedication to championing women’s rights and governance.

Guliye, a former Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission commissioner, is an academician, researcher, and public servant with more than 25 years of experience in university teaching, research and administration, currently serving as an adviser on livestock and rangeland management.

Otieno is an expert in cooperatives currently serving as an adviser on co-operatives and formulates policies to strengthen cooperatives, emphasising on financial inclusion, savings mobilisation, and economic empowerment, particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises.

Menjo is a renowned figure in the agricultural sector, serving as a food security and animal production adviser and is part of a team of agricultural advisors working to transform the agricultural sector, reduce reliance on food imports, and promote exports.

Laibuni is a policy analyst and agricultural economist, currently serving as an associate member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers where she specialises in agricultural public policy, value chain analysis, public expenditure, and food security.

Ogeto who is a legal adviser to the President, has 26 years of experience in law and previously served as the Solicitor General during Uhuru’s administration.

Hassan is a member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors, has little recorded in practical service, whether to the country or abroad.

Ager is a close ally of Raila, serving as an adviser on governance issues.

Nzai is a political adviser and a former Member of the County Assembly for Jomvu Kuu Ward in Mombasa County.

Cheruiyot is the senior advisor to and head of the Presidential Economic Transformation Secretariat.

Kinyua is an expert and adviser on food security with a speciality in crops and value chains

Kenya,Anyone here with experience in contract farming for export in Kenya? (Especially red cabbage),"Hi everyone,  

I'm looking to connect with anyone who has experience in contract farming for export in Kenya — particularly those who’ve grown or exported *red cabbage*. I’m a small-scale farmer based in Bomet and am exploring opportunities to work with export companies that source produce under contract arrangements.  

I have a few questions I’d appreciate insights on:

1. **How did you find reliable export companies offering contract farming arrangements?**  
2. **What crops (besides red cabbage) are in high demand under contract farming schemes?**  
3. **What are typical contract terms (e.g., pricing, inputs, extension services)?**  
4. **What should I look out for in a contract to avoid getting exploited?**

Kenya,Closing My Electronics  Repair Shop in Nairobi CBD After 13 Years,"Hey r/kenya,

It’s with a heavy heart that I’m sharing this, but after 13 years of running my electronics repair shop in Nairobi CBD, I’ve decided to close the doors for good. This business has been my life, and it’s been good to me, made decent money over the years, kept the lights on, and built a loyal customer base. But the challenges have piled up, and it’s just become too much to handle.

The biggest issue is the unrepairability of new devices. Modern electronics are designed to be replaced, not fixed, sealed components, proprietary parts, and manufacturers making it harder for small shops like mine to keep up. On top of that, the stress has been relentless. I’m constantly fielding calls from clients at all hours, chasing updates or complaining about delays, which leaves me mentally drained. The working hours are brutal, often 12-hour days, six days a week, with barely any time for myself or my family. Managing three employees hasn’t helped either; dealing with their schedules, conflicts, and performance issues has added another layer of stress I didn’t sign up for. Combine all that with rising costs and the pressure to stay competitive, and it’s just not sustainable anymore.

I’m not leaving the grind entirely, though. I’m moving into dairy farming and dipping my toes into electrical work out in the field. It’s a big shift, but I’m excited for a change of pace and something that feels more tangible and less overwhelming.

To everyone who’s supported the shop, my customers, suppliers, and even the random redditors who’d pop by after seeing my posts here, thank you.  It’s time for a new chapter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k4lkwh/closing_my_electronics_repair_shop_in_nairobi_cbd/,2025-04-21 19:01:12,Kenya Crops and Dairy
Kenya,This part of my life is called Homeless and Jobless...an update.,"Hey Redditors, it’s me again with an update from last week’s post!

Four days ago, on June 5th, the street kitchen in Githurai where I was washing dishes let go of three of us (out of six) because the owner couldn’t afford to pay us anymore. On top of that, he owes us 10 days’ pay, which has left me in a tough spot.

I’m still homeless, now jobless, and the cold benches lately have been a real challenge—but I’m holding on! The chilly mornings make it harder to rest, and I’m feeling the strain more each day, yet I refuse to give up.

I’m throwing myself to any and all kind of work—content writing, editing, odd jobs, Car wash gigs, you name it! Whether it’s crafting SEO articles, polishing text, or tackling manual tasks, I’m eager to prove my worth.

If you’ve got a lead, I’d love to hear from you. I’m still believing in a turnaround, and even a small gig could change my story.

The thought of steady work keeps me going, offering a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.

This might not resonate with all, but if you possess any valuable leads, that would be great. . Let’s keep pushing together, step by step, toward better days! Below is the link to my previous post.

Kenya,Feminine Hygiene,"I have seen a number of posts from men stating that they have experienced very bad body odor from girls they like,here are some random unsolicited tips to my girlies, please add yours ; let’s make sitting on faces great again!

1. No amount of pineapples will make your butt crack smell good, please wash it with a piece of soft cloth and soap.
2. Schedule your 💩 sessions with your showers so either poop in the morning or evening 
3. Practice sexual hygiene, you can’t be changing patners every week and get away with it, also condoms are great.
4.  Eat healthy, drop the KFC and go heavy on the vegetables (they are cheaper too).
5. Two showers a day is not too much if you live in Kenya.
6. Dry your parts well after the shower .
7. Wash your braids please, there’s a certain smell that comes when you have them in for long
8. Pee immediately after sex and drink loads of water the next day just to make sure you keep on peeing , I don’t know how to explain this but to me it’s like flashing the semen out of your body
9. There’s no reason you have underwear from 4 years ago , change your underwear as often as you can afford to .
10. Check your man as well, what he eats (food and otherwise)..
11. If a man has bad breath don’t let him go down on you, you risk a yeast infection as bad breath usually comes from bacteria in the mouth.

Kenya,The big fat smelly lie of Muslim brotherhood/ummah,"Just before the Palestine genocide started, there was a very fierce Muslim propaganda across the internet. Especially platforms like Twitter. Salafists in UK, Europe and Americas were having a field day man. They were so aggressive and so arrogant. You couldn't miss a day without viral post of salafists, Daawah cult and clerics.  
  
What's crazy is how quickly they vanished when the genocide started. The big fat lie of Muslim Ummah & brotherhood quickly exposed. Isn't it incredible how it has fallen. It's actually a big clown shit show, full of deception, shameless hypocrisy, blatant corruption, and manipulation. Just a shitload of moral empty grandstanding and virtual signaling. Their clerics don't even have the balls to directly call out Israel for the genocide.

In other news, I  just saw news about Jordan's king charging humanitarian groups for every aid delivery passing through his country to Palestine. Can you imagine  
In a similar contradictory drama, the UAE arranged for a bunch of teenage girls to perform a hair-flipping dance for Trump. Apparently, it's pre-Islamic tradition.

Kenya,Pointless argument,"So this lad, maybe 5 years older than me joined the school staff as a bom teacher of math and computer studies (Same combo as mine) like two weeks ago. I'm mostly introverted hence never initiate any conversation in the department. So we mostly stay in the math department due to obvious reasons. I just noticed the guy trying to edit the source code of a website on the department desktop.

 In my mind was like, this are the people we can reason together. Not long after,  a  colleague saw what he was doing and started praising him and even said we should join hands and develop an app like zeraki and get money from it since the school was paying 100k annually for the service. I told the lads that's not possible (without funding), zeraki is big plus they have good marketing strategy.

I was shocked to hear the computer guy talking about local host (saa iyo ako na 4th generation laptop inakaa oven). Nilijaribu hadi kuwaonyesha the AWS host zeraki are using, the lads ignorantly claimed the owners had their own servers.

We switched to talking about laptops, the computer teacher ashaa sema he'll prefer an older laptop (4th generation and below) over any other laptop. 

The guy doesn't even understand the concept of processor generations, doesn't consider the type C technology (a computer teacher calling a micro USB normal cable/ type B?), slim design, energy efficiency (less heat emission), SSD, and faster RAM, multicores and other good stuff that come with latest technology laptops. 

I just mentioned my Lenovo laptop...."" Bro Lenovo ni the worst brand, itaanza kuzima"" I'm like bro, Lenovo is a giant in the laptop market share, actually the oldest from the days of IBM. I've used Lenovo since form 2 and never experienced that.

The conversation switched when a colleague came over to ask if nilishindwa ku fix her Infinix phone which was displaying adds every minute. The lad claimed the phone was refurbished, she should have bought from a supermarket (thinks anything outside the supermarket is fake), I'm like bro, you need knowledge more than assumption, this ad thing has always be an issue with budget phones especially Infinix, Tecno, Itel.  Plus what would be the value of a refurbished budget phone? She bought the phone new. 

The best solution (which both guys wouldn't comprehend) was installing a custom ROM, routing the phone or just buying a better midrange phone./ budget Samsung phone which can rarely have such mediocrity.

Talking of best phones? The guy suggested Motorola. Yani heri ningenyamaza. There's no difference between arguing with him and a regular guy in the streets. An argument should be educative on both ends. Acha tp iishe nirudi kwenye natoka.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kw1u0r/pointless_argument/,2025-05-26 18:33:08,development funding
Kenya,This country is a scam,"Every so often flights to Ben Gurion airport in Israel are cancelled due to Houthi missiles ,fired from Yemen about 2000 kms away. Last year we saw Iranian drones and ballistic missiles strike Israel and despite having being given prior warnings their missile defence systems were unable to shoot down most of the ballistic missiles. Israel had to ask  the US for the THAAD system after this.

So tell me why we are getting a 3.4 bn kshs loan to buy a missile defence system from Israel, that isn't even their most advanced? I mean what even is the point of buying it? Why not use this money to fund R&D programmes to natively develop our own air defence system? It's not as if we are at war that we need to rush things. We will spend 3.4 bn to buy a system that we can't really count on, just like those fighter jets we have which cost us money to maintain but if push comes to shove they wouldn't be of any help.

Kenya,Separating modern political struggle from commercial activism.,"TLDR: Wewe soma kama unajiskia.

First, sijalipwa na mtu. I am expressing my thoughts based on my observations over the last year. Anyway, I just watched the BBC documentary and the fact that the commercial activists are the faces of J25 doesn't sit well with me. I still maintain that J25 was not organic to a great extent. Money exchanged hands and a lot of it. As much as the finance bill protest was meant for Kenyans to collectively push against punitive taxes, an unseen hand funded and pulled the strings. The finance bill was the perfect opportunity for this person or group of people to strike. I also don't think that this person or group of people had the interests of Kenyans at heart. The way those protests started and fizzled out is an indicator.

I know this is an echo chamber, same as KOX but I am not going to hold back. I was skeptical of commercial activists from the word go. If you guys can recall the first day of the protests, these guys casually gave themselves up to the police. It was like a photo op. Casually following the cops, extending their hands to grab the rope that hangs from the back of the lorry and hoisting themselves inside. These guys were even smiling inside there, no chants, just banter as other Kenyans were running and getting teargassed. Their body language was so telling. I voiced that on X. Of course I got bashed, for asking that question I was called a misogynist as if Boniface Mwangi is a woman or a trans guy.

You guys, do not think for once that these activists stand for the same values as you. Remember Boniface Mwangi was supporting Raila, even after this con man revealed his cabinet of criminals and drug dealers like this cocaine guy from Mombasa, Joho? He stood with the same side that was funded by Uhuru Kenyatta, a looter, land grabber, and economic assassin. Which values was he standing for exactly? I believe these guys kina Boni, Hanifa, Njeri, Shakira, and most of the people who were captured in those awe-inspiring patriotic moments were paid. It was not a coincidence. Also note that they used a lot of women, psychological tacts to use misogyny as a defense when people start raising questions.

I want to remind you that these people do not share the struggle with ordinary Kenyans. These guys are well-funded, they have money. If things went south, they would be granted asylum in some of the most developed countries in a heartbeat. They probably always have their passports ready and an exit plan. It is ordinary Kenyans who were killed and injured during those protests, these activists were not even in the frontlines. I laugh when I see people propose that some of these people deserve political seats because they are activists. This is the same system of using political seats as gifts we are up against yet people want to perpetuate it. Tf is wrong with Kenyans?

What I'm saying is we need to separate our struggle from these activists. They can join us in agitating but don't think they are in it because they are so patriotic. If it wasn't for the money, how sure are you they would be doing it? They don't deserve political seats because they are activists. Mohamed Ali was an investigative journalist but after getting elected he sided with the oppressor, same with John Kiarie, a political satirist. We need a second wave of agitating for change but we must decenter the movement from commercial activists. Their moves, intentions, and sources of funding can easily be used to discredit an otherwise innocent and genuine struggle for change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k9orkn/separating_modern_political_struggle_from/,2025-04-28 06:14:36,development funding

Kenya,The Bare Minimum SGR Experience,"As a frequent user of the SGR, it’s hard not to feel like the experience is just at best, bare minimum. The stations are massive, impressive in design, yet strangely underutilized. The parking lots of both NBO and MSA terminals are just chaotic .No WiFi in the lounges —why is WiFi still a mystery in 2025?

Booking online is efficient, but strangely limited. You can’t choose your seat or coach—why? In a world where airlines and buses let you select your seat, this sgr feels wierd. And the fact that you still have to print your ticket at the station? What kind of 1950s backwardness is this? The ticket printing process is a sludge of slow lines and often malfunctioning machines. Why force human contact when none is needed?

To make it worse, there’s no SGR ticket office in town, forcing most travelers to take a long trip just to sort out some ticket issues. And then there is the bare minimum First Class. For 4,500 shillings,I expected more. No refreshments,no WiFi —just fewer humans in a coach.

I could go on and on. But like many projects in Kenya, the SGR had so much promise, and it’s frustrating to see it settling into mediocrity instead of aiming for excellence.

Kenya,"""Wapi mtoto?""","It was always an escape for me during holidays ile wakati ya kuendea maziwa, most of you won't understand obviously. 

Our dad had this small library for us, na huko tulikua tunatoka tu wakati wa kuoga, kukula, na kuendea maziwa, because we had housemaid and farm boy.

So matime ilikua imefika ya kuendea maziwa, three kilometers away, juu ile ng'ombe yetu ya maziwa ilikua imepigwa baller, ikaamua maziwa haitoki. 

So it was just feeding, depositing ammonia and sleeping. Haijui vile ilinisaidia kutoka jela kidogo, ile furaha nilikua nayo, I would supply to five depressed guys na wasahau shida zao walai.

So we went with my bro, had time to chat juu library hakukua na kupiga story, laugh and enjoy the freedom.

At around 8p.m ndio tulikua tunarudi nyumbani, so we got to the kitchen placed the milk kwa meza and left, but before tutoke kitchen, there he was, very mean face at the door staring us.

Mi ni kama niliona tiger kwa mlango hio siku.

He looked scary akijam, so we hesitated to get to the kitchen's door.

""Wapi mtoto?"" He roared.

""Mtoto mgani?"" I responded.

If only we could have the ability to time travel and I had to change something, mimi ningechange hio part, nifyate ulimi.

That's how I borrowed 10kgs of a blow, ngumi ilinituma kwa mchanga tukabanja na mchwa dakika moja pale.

""Umemuumiza baba Colin."" My mother tried to defend me, lakini when it came to this prison wardener, kichapo haikua na conditions, hata sauti ya mpenzi haingesaidia.

My bro disappeared from the kitchen kama sungura, sijaijua huyo morio alipita aje mzae,  but he was not in the kitchen when I got up.

I was surprised which baby this mzee was asking, then I heard mom, ""Mbona mlienda na Ferdy kuchukua maziwa na ni mtoto bado, hata hakua na sweater.""

I swear to God I didn't know that son of troubles, kijana ambaye anatumia mguu kufikiria followed us.

Hata sikua nimejibu mom, nyaunyo ilikua ishanilamba mgongo, I walked like a kangaroo mpaka nje, mgongo ilikua imepinda kama bakora ya kukaa, lakini mguu haikutaka kusikia hivyo tena.

Now we were having a conversation kama niko 100 metres away, ""Mi sijui Ferdy ako wapi?"" Kiburi ilikua imepanda.

""Muende mtafte mtoto ama msirudi hapa."" He screamed.

Sisi na bro were clueless, 'saa tatu ya usiku jamani kwani sisi si watoto pia?' I thought.

""Tusipopata huyu mjukuu ya wazee wasumbufu mi naenda kitale kutafta job."" I furiously suggested.

""Hatuna ID."" Ndio ule kijana mwoga akanijibu.

""We unataka kufa ama kuishi?"" I asked him.

Before he responded, a bright flash light was directed to our faces. How you know the countryside norm, by saa tatu watu wamelala, and no lights outside, giza totoro.

We were scared but didn't care, because we had no home if we don't find that stubborn kid.

""Colin."" I heard the neighbor calling.

""Mnatafta huyu."" He continued.

Mimi sikutaka kujua neighbor ni mzae ako na family, before I even said a word, nilikua nishapakulia huyo msumbufu kijibare hapo, akatoka mbio mpaka nyumbani.

""Asante."" We told him and followed that cheeky boy home.

Mzee alikua hapo nje kwa uwanja with mom, and the mischievous kid.

""Kujeni hapa!"" He roared.

""Lala chini!"" He commanded. 

Mischievous kid alikua side yake, he was given one whip, aiyaya yaya yaaa, it seemed hurting, juu he woke up na kukalee around the big house mara tatu as he grabbed his sitting apparatus.

Mimi nilikua numb walai, couldn't even move, ni ka nilikua nimesniff bangi ndoo mzima.

My bro was the next, moja, kijana alipiga nduru ni kama mtu anaenda jehanamu, and then ladies and gents it was my time.

Ile methali ya cha mwenzako kikinyolewa chako tia maji, waliambia wale wako na time ya kutia maji, I had no time. 

Nilipachikwa uchungu nanii, mimi sikuzunguka nyumba, nilipata muscle pool. 

'Eeei jamani, kwani sisi tulikuwa watoto wa nani?' I thought.

""Kuja umalizie yako Ferdy, alafu nyinyi mmebaki na mbili ndio msirudie hio mchezo."" Mzae claimed.

'Nimebaki na mbili?' I was thinking of just escaping and never come back.

Wewe ndugu yako ashaikuweka kwa mess?

5:00 pm came na tukaitwa sasa na the green police, sema machozi 😫😫 tunapigia our guy tumuulize rada ya receipt, simu imezima

Kenya,Is this a general erosion in culture? Or is it just moral decay?,"Firstly, Happy mother's day to all the mums holding it down for their babies/families. I personally see *you.* I am rooting for you in everything you are setting out to do for the remainder of the year. *Cheers!*

It has come to my attention that there's a serious erosion in ""culture"" or maybe its just morals in this case, in the treatment women/mothers are accorded. I mean when I was younger, mothers were held in some sort of reverence. **They were respected.** 

Now? All I see is aggressive undertones in how children, women, and mothers are viewed especially by men. It's really no surprise that femicide is on the rise(*If you didn't sign the petition  to criminalize femicide, I hope you do so today*). 

The general lack of empathy towards women is especially blatant in how single mums are regarded. I mean the contempt, the anger, the hate towards single mums is palpable. Its sad that the parent who stays is now regarded as stupid, for that. There's actually a steady rise in the number of women choosing to leave their children behind at the end of a relationship, their well being be damned. I attribute it to this online hate.

Let's not even talk about the lack of empathy towards children. As a mum, I'm so scared for my baby. It seems like the worst time in history to procreate.

Now, you as a single, childless woman is wondering, ""What's this got to do with me?"". Oh, YOU should be very concerned about this. While single mums are easy targets for this hate, you are not exempt.

Kenya,He carries everyone.....but who carries him?,"I know someone....kind, selfless, responsible, caring and everything you can call it, It hurts.  The kind of person who’d rather stay hungry than watch anyone else lack. A true mtu wa watu.  But sometimes I wonder, who is there for him? He care about everyone....who cares about him?

After his mum passed on, his dad decided to remarry. Which is fine, Everyone deserves happiness. But instead of handling his own plans, the man sat down, made a phone call and was like,  ""Naonelea nioe tena, but i don't have money for dowry, please help raise that for me."" Just like that. No shame! No budget! No plan! No ""are you in a good place financially? Nothing!!! And now he gotta feed both the dad and his new wife, i hope kids will have mercy on him and not add to the number🥱

Then comes the younger brother. No job, No income, No nothing, just vibes...decides arusi ni lazima. Marries. Hata haogopi jamani...   Before we even digest the wedding, mtoto wa kwanza is here.  Then baby number two, Wakaona...hapana he doesn't have enough responsibilities they brought in baby number three.  

Why? Big bro sends money every month. Like rent, utadhani umfanya kazi ya maana apewe mshahara, the family ATM! A walking Mpesa code!!!! Ati mtegemea cha nduguye hufanyaje??

I once told him, “Jaribu and don’t send anything this month, wacha tuone vile watasurvive.”  He looked at me like I’d said something evil.  ""Unafanya mchezo na maisha ya watu."" Me! Mchezo?  .... but no one ever worries about his life, do they?

One time we were just talking... quietly like he wasn’t even talking to me anymore.  ""I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’ll never live in a nice house, or drive a cool car, or have much for myself. I’ve accepted that. I have responsibilities. Everyone depends on me. And that’s just how my life is, this Is my fate.” I just nodded, but my eye betrayed me and my cheek carried the evidence.

And I sat there. Speechless! Because this man, with a heart big enough to carry a whole village, doesn't know what it feels like to be carried.. ..We all got such parasites in our community and it's shameful, people ain't even trying, milking others is a kind of art they have mastered.

And it’s not just his dad. Or his brother. There are so many more...even when he’s the one with the emptiest hands it's always non of their business.

I look at him and wonder...If he ever became unavailable… would anyone survive? Or would they simply move on and find the next person to drain? Cause, let’s be honest….   Sometimes being dependable just makes you the easiest one to forget. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1k97j7m/he_carries_everyonebut_who_carries_him/,2025-04-27 16:08:44,SoCha
Kenya,Hehehehe the day I ran away,"Story time

When I was in high school it reached a point where I felt the beating from my mother is too much and I was actually not that naughty but my mom used to beat us vibaya sana,so I decided after closing school am gonna run away 🤣🤣🤣 this was my plan,I didn't tell anyone that was a meeting I had in my head

So when we closed on the weekend I told my mom am heading to tao just to visit a friend and she was like ok ata she gave me fare and I didn't carry any clothes so it doesn't look suspicious,mimi huyo until tao then took another mathree to my grandma's house that was my escape plan 🤣🤣🤣 my shosho's place is not far from tao so I reached, that time was kitambo my grandma was still working and those days we used landline phones

So evening came grandma reached found me,we chat for abit told her ""I came here to umwind kidogo but I haven't said home inshort nimetoroka hehehehe""she was like it's ok and I was happy coz before when we were really young she wasn't that accommodating,so for that period of like one month I was there at grandma's place there no stress and I was with my other cuzos and my aunty, all that time I was there my mom didn't call so I knew she was not looking for me 😞 plus that time her and her mother(My grandma) were not in talking terms so my grandma didn't call also to say anything

When my mom is angry everyone keeps off even her mom coz weeh my mom goes crazy mpaka kutumia vulgar language so people just keep off to let her cool down,so after the one month and school was going to open I had to go home because of school I had no choice I knew I had to face the music,I knew what was waiting for me 😭 ""kichapo cha ""umbwa"" so I left my grandma's house,let me tell u Maina that was the longest journey ever,finally I got home as soon as I entered the gate my heart was beating so fast like it was about to come out of my chest

Then I went to enter the house coz we used to live the door open she was seated at the couch and the eyes she gave me I knew I am finished,I had a ka paper bag with some clothes I was bought for by my shosh,we had a house maid she was told to go get the mwiko weh let me tell u nilichapwa nikachapwa nikachapwa,I cried 😭 but wapi she used to beat us until she gets tired that's when she will stop until ur body is swollen,weh I was really beaten yaani hadi she climbs ontop of me and then she used to take a knife ""anakuwekea kwa shingo anakuambia unataka ni kuuwe""🤦🏾 aki unastuka finally it was over 

She was thinking in her mind I went to a man's house/boyfriend's place (but I did not have a boyfriend nor did I even know about s*x that time I was naive not even kissing I just had crushes and nothing more progressed,so when I told her I went to grandma's place she didn't believe me at all yet she didn't call my grandma(her mother)coz of her ego,so finally Monday I went to school and thought it's over but it wasn't even close to over kumbe they thought I was pregnant coz I had added abit of weight nkt 

This adding of weight happened all the time I went to grandma's place coz I used to say the food there is delicious so I used to eat more than my portion and my mom knows that but still didn't believe me and she doesn't want to confirm with my grandma(her mom)coz of her ego,so after afew days when I was in my night dress (it used to be a big t-shirt) which was loose, my father called me before I went to sleep and he was like can u spread ur arms,I did that then turn around I did that then he was like go so I just went didn't think anything of it

Then after few days same same it happened like 2 or 3 times then stopped when I finally asked my mom to give me money to buy pads I guess she told him (my dad)and they were like ""phew"" they knew all is good, remember I still have no idea what's going on at all

So years later when am an adult my mom starts talking about that story and she was like do u remember that day u were being told to turn around it was bcoz ur Father thought u were pregnant imagine 😞 I felt so bad really hurt coz I was at my grandma's place all they had to do was ask my grandma just a phone call away but no then Mom was saying it was my Dad but it was both of them.she was also relieved when I got my period plus my mom has a tendency ya kuruka mtu we are used to that by now she rukad my Dad and it was both of them who were doubting me then said it was my dad even, the day we were Chased away from home (in my earlier post) after few months later she started regretting 

Then she started telling people it was my Dad who chased us away and  she was not involved 🤦🏾 yet they chased us both together

I mean I understand the aspect of not having options and making do with what's available to survive but I'd rather choose sth different than ""accomodate"" a little.

People have medical reasons as to why they don't consume certain things and I happen to have a taste and texture issue.
A lot has been said abt my ""expensive taste"" yet I am just an honest guy who would rather tell you honestly abt sth  than we have the awkwardness of me pretending that I am okay while my throat and tougues are reeling from absolute disgust.

Kenya,Spreading some light on the fertilizer situation,"Ok so we have probably heard of some high profile ppl talk abt the fertilizer “scandal” I put it in quotes cause most of it is pure misinformation. 

Before i start with what I know, I’d like to comment how I know it first…. I am 23(m) quite junior in all things politics and agriculture however my dad was/is a “high profile “ individual who is part of the directors in one of these agricultural departments (keeping it a vague as possible)… that probably answers how I know some of these things 

What I know…. Russia donated fertilizer about, 35,000 tonnes (that’s a lot… thx Russia ) my dad was a part of these departments that tried to repurpose these into more… so smart ppl reformulated it into 100,000 tonnes (thanks smart ppl ) 

Controversy spurs by some individuals saying these fertilizer were given then resold to the govt… this in particular is a lie, the reformulation was handled by public offices with private assistance obv things like storage and processing was outsourced but held publicly… 

Kenya consumes abt 800k tonnes of fertilizer yearly and 35k was donated… but the subsidy was around 70% in 2022 it was abt 40% so Russian donations + govt intervention directly caused the price of fertilizer to reduce.. ofc they are inefficiencies and mis appropriation i think 10-15% of the fertilizer was stolen by more senior persons but it wasn’t an all out quack show..

Ask me questions, let’s see if I can answer some

Kenya,I am starting to get the meaning of love from a female P.O.V(or not 😆),"Epiphany?? I don't know but I finally realised that my perspective of love is so different from women's. Yeah I understand that it should be common sense but yoooh! This people are amazing men. Like dude! They have a different perspective and its so fucking exciting!!!!!!!! 🤪
So get this, I am not the guy who believes like ""oh we are rushing things"" ""we should take it slowly"" I believe that if we kissed that night it happened at the right moment..(Consensually Of course 🙂) So I used to not feel like guilty abt something we both enjoyed doing. Like I am sorry if nitakaa fala but all in all I do tell most of the people I get intimate with that I am like that and if they're not comfortable with it, its fine we'll go our separate ways or I'll find a way to ""behave"" myself. Ikishindikana ndacommunicate abt what I am feeling and if you're okay with it I'll make it worthwhile. Anyway enough abt me, I've come to realise that (maybe wrong🫢) Women prefer to take things slowly because of the luxury of overthinking about every single thing about you. Especially if the like you (eyyyy maiiilod🥹).....
see I always had the courtesy of talking things out with someone b4 being intimate and success rate has been amazing.. but yeah I always encounter the statement ""I think we are moving too fast"" .. somehow my response to that statement always worked and we ended up sharing a moment or getting intimate. Okay see 👀 lemme get back to what I was saying.
I think women like fantasizing about you more because the thrill and dopamine rush is so fucking good. Like that time that you tried to kiss her and she shyed away is because you hit her with sth ""unexpected"" and she wasn't  prepared and it felt good but she didn't want to do it first because she was scared of how you might have reacted...
Yo!yo!yo!yo! That is fucking amazing.
Do you guys understand the mental thrill in such a scenario 😅 that's amazing. I'm  always a go getter and I usually put my mind into something and do my best to get it and if I dont I just let go and leave. I do communicate everything and I am honest abt me.(learnt never to do this the hard way😂)
Slippery slope is all I can say!😆 but you get it? I'll be straightforward from the moment I smell like yeah lemme just say it out loud... but eyyy baba! Unaona after ameshy away from hio kiss take your time b4 doing it again uone venye itamamnice mbaya na wewe kwanza ndo utapigwa kimunju...😅 mtu wangu huwanga fiti mzee 😜. Unajua in between your first failed attempt and the second one that girl will spend so much time fantasising about it again and again and again and each time ataplay scenarios za it going so fucking well and thinking of how they want you to make them feel about it and atleast a scenario where it goes terribly bad and you either stop and discover sth bad about her (they do care about appearance my guy🤫) and you either run away or I don't  know we elewa tu kuna venye!!!! Donge🫴
 So the longer this takes the longer you make her crave for it and to prepare for it in all the best ways possible. Mtu wangu utatayarishiwa 😅 so take your time and don't even bring it up again and just know that ukiendelea kumbamba utapewa Kiss heheheheh eyyyy!!! 
They like the thrill it comes with.. Don't rush things my guys...Take your time and every single moment you get with her utaenjoy....usijichoche ati venye we ni bazu huwa unaperform everywhere you go and you get everything the first days..hio kitu itakuwa short lived mtu wangu  na wewe ndo utaumia roho lakini utajifanya uko sawa juu hamkuwa mnadate hata 😅 ukiwa in it for the long run... take your time uone.😄
Juu unaona her fantasizing about it gives her feelings of joy, happiness and anafeel to visexy yaani anafeel appreciated so that turns her on alot and mkiwa pamoja utaona akicheza na nywele ama akikuguza guza randomly. She'll also maybe have a wet dream about you. SO boss take your time, make her crave for it.. mtese kidogo avoid physical touches kiasi and try and not stare at her lips just short hugs and quick goodbyes. Hahahaha she'll overthink that thing msee. SO  the longer you take the sexier it gets for both of you.Alafu kwanza kuna kale ka negative thought kamoja ka either akudisappoint ama umdisappoint na atahave kukudiscard as early as possible ama we uchoree story zake inaletanga a clash of sth called hot and sweet......wolololoyaye sasaaa 😅
Mtu wangu patience ni mzuri.. especially if works in both of your favor.......you'll feel like umeaccomplish such an amazing feat.I guess the same concept  applies in all aspects of life.

Wah!! Mwenye anakuja next ataenjoy 😆😆😆

There’s always that sellout that ruins the very thing we’re trying to solve. And if we can’t sit down to question and understand the gravity of the problem then I only see more sellouts than I can count

Just today in school we were discussing about corruption and the Lec asked one question, would you guys accept bribes even if it went against what you stand for?

Most of the class said yes!

So it’s not really the fact that there are bad leaders or corruption. It’s just a bunch of sellout mentality engraved in our minds

Can’t we just pause the sellout mentality for even 10 years to give prosperity a chance to flourish??

Kenya,China Square Is Minting Billions: Here’s How You Can Too,"China Square has become a retail giant almost overnight. From a single store to over five branches in less than five years, they’ve built a booming business selling everything from kitchenware and stationery to home furniture.

What’s their secret?

It's not flashy marketing. It's not celebrity endorsements. It's something far simpler and anyone can do it.

They mastered product sourcing.

Here’s how they did it and how you can copy their exact playbook.

1. They Source Smart, Direct from China

Almost every product on China Square’s shelves is imported from China. Only a few items come from third-party vendors.

Want to know why that matters?

Let me show you.

During a visit, I spotted a basic ceramic mug on their shelf priced at KSH 250. Out of curiosity, I searched for the same product on Alibaba and found it listed for just KSH 40.

That’s a 525% markup.

I checked a few more items, storage boxes, office supplies, even furniture accessories, and the pattern was clear:

China Square buys low and sells high, while still offering competitive prices compared to local suppliers.

2. Volume Is the Game

By importing in bulk from manufacturers on Alibaba, China Square keeps their costs extremely low. That gives them the power to dominate pricing in the market and scale fast.

Lower sourcing costs mean higher profit margins, which fuel business expansion.

3. You Can Do It Too

The beauty of this model is that it’s not exclusive to big corporations. Whether you run a small store, sell online, or dream of opening your own retail chain, you can start sourcing from China today.

Look for suppliers on Alibaba, negotiate lower pricing, ship bulk and sell locally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l674ig/china_square_is_minting_billions_heres_how_you/,2025-06-08 08:17:36,supply chain USAID

Kenya,Tatties,"I come from a region where potatoes **could** do better. Planted some shangi last year, after getting duped by UrbanFresh(that the seeds were markies variety!). I am prejudiced against shangi. So I prefer Dutch Robjn.  The prob is Dutch Robijn sells out fast on NPCKVIAZISOKO.COM, unlike other varieties like sherekea, markies, unica. 



Just seen that there's a new variety of potatoes called Challenger. Any farmers trialed it out? Word on the ground is that its susceptible to blight which is another headache I don't want to deal with.



Unrealibility of certified seeds is a major hindrance. Then add the fact that seeds sold in most parts are bacterial wilt infested. Which leads to poor yield and infested soils.


Questions for the potato farmers:


1. Where do you usually source your seeds from?


2. How do you deal with blight(late, early)?


3. How much does your yield fetch?


4. On the supply chain, how far are you from the consumer?


5. Which seasons do you prefer?


6. How do you deal with bacterial wilt?


7. Which variety do you mostly plant?


8. Do you involve intense agronomic savvy in your farming or you just wing it i.e. plant and hope for the best?


9. Have you ever hearda precision farming?

Kenya,Gen M.Langley (US Africom head),"I listened to him on Dr. Kingori’s podcast, and for all the flak he’s been catching over his remarks on Ibrahim Traoré, I found him to be one of the very few especially among Westerners who actually grasp the security dynamics in Africa, particularly in the Sahel.

There’s a widespread habit  among both Western analysts and even many Africans  of projecting the Middle Eastern framework of jihadism onto African jihadist groups. But that comparison often misses the mark. The jihadist groups in the Sahel aren’t simply bands of men radicalized by fiery imams, all obsessed with building a caliphate. That’s not how it started.

Back in the early 2000s, at the height of the War on Terror, the Sahara was relatively safe. Mali even hosted the 2002 AFCON, and the Dakar Rally used to pass right through the desert. Today, that entire region is crawling with terrorists and criminal networks. So, what changed? Where did they come from?

The truth is, many African governments have never had the capacity to fully control their territory. In those neglected regions, armed tribal or clan-based militias naturally spring up, much like the bandit groups we see in Kenya’s North Rift and Northeastern regions. These militias have long existed in the Sahel. In fact, Gaddafi often hired them to fill out his Libyan army.

Now, it’s worth remembering: most of these Sahelian communities are Muslim. They’ve practiced Islam for generations,but not the fundamentalist kind. So what you had were armed Muslim militias, not radical jihadis. That changed after Gaddafi was overthrown. The chaos in Libya opened the floodgates, and a mix of shady characters started flowing south through the Sahara, just as people have done for centuries. Among them were ultra-conservative, militant clerics preaching a violent brand of Islam. And when they arrived in the Sahel, they hit the jackpot.

Here were militias of young, armed Muslim men, stuck in regions crippled by state neglect, drought, and desperation — the perfect recruits. All they needed was a little push. These clerics gave them one. Instead of fighting over water, grazing land, or goats, they were now fighting for “something greater”: the will of God. And just like that, the militias evolved slowly but surely into full-blown jihadist groups.

A great case study of this transformation is the relationship between the MNLA (National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad) and jihadist groups like Ansar Dine and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). At first, they were allies. They ousted the Malian state from the north and declared the independent Tuareg state of Azawad. But it didn’t last. The MNLA was secular; AQIM and Ansar Dine were Islamists. Tensions grew, especially when the jihadists started imposing Sharia law. The MNLA was having none of it. The alliance crumbled, and today, they’re bitter rivals. I remember hearing a young MNLA leader saying: yes, they were Muslim, but they never intended to create an Islamic state.

Kenya,Is it time to come to countenance that grass isn’t greener on the other side but where you choose to water it?," 

The Kenyan government has been lying to its citizens, that it is making plans to secure them jobs abroad. When in reality exporting slaves in airplanes, not on the once dingy ships. Not on farms but on construction sites. Not to feudal masters but home masters as housemaids.

The world, with uttermost honesty, is grappling with a shift in order. The people abroad are confused, countries have no job opportunities to offer its citizens. The UK prime minister recently declared a fight against unlawful immigrants, and the need to tighten its doors on job opportunities to undocumented immigrants and students.

Canada, a once upon land of abundance, the autumn leaves no longer bring peace, rather a potential resource for embers, embers of pain.

There has been a serious immigration into Kenya and Africa by people abroad. Many of our ‘majuu’ uncles and aunts, are coming back to Kenya, to a fresh start.

The USA declared a fight on immigrants. Americans in cities are moving to upcountry!

Then here I am with the American dream. Maybe it is time to wake up, at least I can have a check of the reality, lest I pee on self, if I keep dreaming.

Dreaming of greener grasses, when the grass on both sides is dry; sufficient to light embers to warm the aching cold heart, engulfed with regret and confusions.  

What are the best options? Move back/away home or water the dry grass?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1knxk0q/is_it_time_to_come_to_countenance_that_grass_isnt/,2025-05-16 10:33:15,Africa Water Facility
Kenya,"792,694: a national crisis?","TW: life.
This is an appeal to apologists, philosophers, counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and anyone who can dedicate some mental bandwidth to wade the murky waters of this issue. There were 792,694 abortions in Kenya in 2023. Key highlights from the Daily Nation story on 3/5/2025:

• 66% were not using method of family planning when they became pregnant. 

• 78.6% of post abortion care patients were married or living with a partner and young (age 25-34, 41.8%)

• 6/10 married and educated women who previously had babies account for the highest induced abortion rates. 

• 37% of those who sought post abortion care had secondary level education and 91% identify as Christians

• 89.4% preferred medication as one method 

• 82% only had one lifetime abortion 


• Key reasons include being unprepared for parenthood and the high cost of raising a child.
 
This high number is something we need to reflect deeply upon because it has profound implications for the future of Kenya. The very fabric of society means that these are dreams and potential gone. It's deeper than the pro life/choice debate because after the online shock, mockery, polarization, and jokes about it, real families are living in the aftermath of this reality. Pro-choice could mean carrying a pregnancy to term, and pro-life could mean exploring adoption before delivery. 
  
There are several angles to pick from the story; this article will narrow down to the state of the Kenyan family. 
  
Let's therefore ponder:
1. How can church communities improve awareness and education about contraception without shame and stigma? 
2. What does it mean to be prepared for parenthood? 
3. How can the costs of raising a child come down? 
4. What policies can improve the quality of education and healthcare while subsidizing costs long term? 
5. Are CBC & SHA in their current state increasing the financial strain on families? 
6. How will local church communities partner with grassroots health facilities to offer preventive or post care for rape survivors?
7. If infidelity is a contributing factor to these cases, how can we review genuine relationship satisfaction and longevity?
8. Could normalizing adoption in social conversation or dating change this situation?
9. How do harsh work environments or indirect career penalties contribute to this crisis?
10. The role of abuse: be it emotional, mental, physical, financial or spiritual in breaking trust in relationships or marriages to compounding this. 
11. Does post abortion care include counseling and appropriate preventive measures?
12. Where are safe spaces for such conversations to go on? 

If we fail to approach this with compassion and safety, shame and fear could make it unimaginably worse. We can't afford to wait for external intervention. We need to be the ones extending safety, understanding and compassion where we are to make a difference. 

Edit: this is in no way written to shame or condemn those who have had an abortion. If anything, this post is an invitation to have social introspection about what could be done better.

""Seed oils are poison!"", ""Beans are actually carbs, not protein!"", ""Sugar is the root of all evil!"". Of course some of these are true and backed by science but its sickening to have it repackaged for engagement with those doing the repackaging positioning themselves as experts or talking about these things like they are new discoveries.

Most of these ""experts"" wouldn’t have a clue what they’re talking about without ChatGPT spoon-feeding them their content. AI has made it incredibly easy to regurgitate information without understanding it. And now, we have an entire economy of influencers charging for things like meal plans; literally just AI-generated templates with fancy branding with Kenyans falling for them.

Many of these pseudo experts don’t even follow their own advice. They’ll tell you to cook with coconut oil, but step into their kitchen, and you’ll probably find a bottle of Golden Fry sitting right there. The inconsistencies are endless.

The danger in all of this? AI is great at summarizing existing knowledge, but it doesn’t replace real expertise. Yet, millions are blindly following these pseudo-gurus who have no real background in nutrition, no ability to critically analyze studies, and no accountability when their advice leads to misinformation or harm.

AI should be a tool, not a crutch. But for many, it’s become their entire personality. And that’s a serious problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1imviaz/the_rise_of_aigenerated_fake_experts_in_health/,2025-02-11 10:22:47,Unknown
Kenya,Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis. ,"**Kenya floods: Costs pressure mounts on country in economic crisis**
More than 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.

There were early warnings (https://meteo.go.ke/forecast/seasonal-forecast) that Kenya’s long rain season – between March and May – was going to bring above-normal rainfall. The extreme intensity of the rain has resulted in devastating floods in many parts of the country. Forty of the country’s 47 counties have been affected. More than (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) 250 people have died and over 54,000 households, so far, have been displaced.
Poor maintenance of key infrastructure and drainage systems, and disregard of environmental regulations regarding maintenance of land near rivers, contributed to the situation.
The government has responded with measures to minimise destruction and
safeguard lives. These include ordering the evacuation of households living close to dams (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/3/kenya-floods-10) and water reservoirs (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/86-families-ordered-to-move-out-of-ruiru-village-in-kijabe/) in 33 counties, and forced evictions (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/nairobi/article/2001494577/residents-living-on-riparian-land-cry-foul-over-forceful-eviction) of those living near rivers. President William Ruto has also announced welfare support for displaced households (https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2024/05/president-ruto-announces-sh10000-stipend-for-displaced-households/).
The effects of the flooding will have a massive impact on Kenya’s economy. I’m a development economist (https://www.tegemeo.org/images/_tegemeo_institute/staff_profiles/dr_timothy_njagi_profile.pdf) with 20 years of experience in the field of development planning, policy implementation and research. I’ve also worked with the National Treasury and Economic Planning (https://www.treasury.go.ke/).
I’m particularly concerned about these things: damage done to transport infrastructure, which will affect the prices for goods and services; destruction of crops, which will affect food security; and business losses, which will affect household incomes and consumer purchasing power.
The cost of repairing what’s brokenwill also have a major impact on the country’s budget, which is already stretched.

**The impacts**
**Infrastructure destroyed**
A great deal of infrastructure has been affected.
Besides roads, some dams, airports and water infrastructure will require maintenance.
Floods and a landslide on the railway route between the capital Nairobi and Mombasa forced Kenya Railways (https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kenyas-rail-operator-says-floods-144935922.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACdZl4Lw9kOCOkT1iZzN_G4G9VakYCev6Y4ZLhJnnheiU51RSzkRTGQbFGHnxunqEmRejJyEKQVc1JtQ-1KByCGTEkjIkqPfLBkEqD0i6ICfnAC8nYqMaMxUTk-XSRTXsyMVFJqFYKii-Q2DyJkAdHKmkNZ4zrfhkVbZB19c3_ii) to close all cargo services. Nairobi satellite commuter train services were also suspended (https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-05-02-kenya-railways-suspends-nairobi-passenger-train-services/).
Currently, 58 roads have been reported (https://www.redcross.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8-05-2024_-_MAM.pdf) destroyed. Some of these roads (https://www.k24tv.co.ke/news/floods-render-major-roads-impassable-138210/) are key highways, such as the Kapenguria-Lokichar-Lodwar highway, Nakuru-Eldoret road and Oletepesi-Magadi road. The Nakuru-Eldoret road also connects Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
The road disruptions will immediately raise the cost of transport as goods will go via longer routes. This will have an effect on businesses in the transport, wholesale and retail sectors.
The rains have also affected service infrastructure – like water pipelines (https://eastleighvoice.co.ke/city-affairsnews/39520/city-hall-repairs-3-main-water-pipelines-damaged-by-floods) in Nairobi – and filled dams to capacity. In one tragic incident, a dam in Kijabe burst its banks (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/29/dozens-of-people-dead-in-kenya-floods), flooding villages and killing at least 40 people in the Mai Mahiu area.
The destruction of infrastructure will have a major economic impact. Assessments from the last major flooding (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746) in 2018 show that the government had to allocate an extra US$120 million (24% of the budget in the previous year) for repairs and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The repairs weren’t immediate and sometimes weren’t carried out at all (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jfr3.12746). The effects were felt for years (https://nation.africa/kenya/news/cost-of-flooding-to-be-felt-for-years-reports-show-48494).
**Cropland destroyed**

Kenya’s agriculture sector has also been hit hard. Agriculture is vital to the economy, accounting for (https://www.usaid.gov/kenya/agriculture-food-and-water-security) about 33% of the country’s GDP and employing 40% of the total workforce. It’s a critical source of livelihood and income for millions of Kenyans.
About 40,000 acres (https://www.redcross.or.ke/floods/) (16,187 hectares) of cropland has already been reported to have been destroyed (https://www.citizen.digital/news/ahero-rice-farmers-count-loses-as-floods-wash-off-plantations-n341619). In the 2018 floods, it was estimated that about 21,000 (https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/hunger-looms-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-east-africa) acres of crops were destroyed and that was a threat to food security. The impact of the floods on Kenya’s agriculture was substantial, with estimates suggesting billions of Kenyan shillings (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/hunger-looms-as-floods-destroy-crops-sweep-away-animals-in-east-africa-1393560) in crop damage and lost production. Additionally, the floods
triggered landslides and soil erosion.
This time, twice as much land is affected. Farmers in affected areas face a total crop failure, their entire livelihoods washed away. The flooding of 2,000 acres of the Mwea Irrigation Scheme (https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001494684/food-crisis-looms-as-farmers-warn-of-total-crop-failure?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=may2024), for instance, is likely to result in losses to the tune of KSh60 million (about US$445,000) in lost crop. This doesn’t include the loss to businesses that would have used the crop.
So far, the basket regions – where most of the staple food production takes place – have been spared the worst of the flooding. However, there is a very high likelihood of perishable crops such as vegetables and pulses recording very low yields. They have shorter maturity and may have been waterlogged or swept away.
The effect on food security will likely be felt much longer. Though Kenya has yet to estimate the effect of the flooding on food production, in Tanzania – which exports food to Kenya – there are estimates that the floods will cause a 30% decline in production this year (https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/science-health/ea-braces-for-hunger-as-floods-destroy-farms-4612440). Food prices will likely stay high.
**Cost to the purse**
Kenya’s economy is still recovering from shocks that include high debt distress, global food inflation and exchange rate shock.
The budget estimates (https://www.treasury.go.ke/budget-books-1/) for the next financial year reveal that the government has a delicate balancing act in trying to meet commitments as well as stimulating key sectors of the economy.
To cater for emergency response to the flooding situation, the government has forwarded a supplementary budget of Ksh11 billion (about US$80 million) (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/government-seeks-mps-nod-on-sh10-6bn-to-combat-floods--4613976) to the National Assembly for approval. This will likely all be spent to provide direct support to households, resettle displaced
households and reconstruct infrastructure such as schools and health facilities.
The government is already struggling to meet revenue targets (https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/kra-in-tough-race-to-collect-sh1-1-trillion-in-four-months--4562510#google_vignette) due to a slowdown in economic performance. The total reconstruction will cost much more, and will divert resources from other sectors.
**Better preparation**
Overall, the current flooding will have long-term effects on the economy. The turnaround depends on the choices that policymakers make. A balance has to be maintained between reconstruction efforts and support to productive sectors of the economy, while offering support to those that have been affected.
There is a need to learn from the current disaster to prepare better for the next climate shock.
First, the disaster response of county
governments must be strengthened. For instance, storm water drainage – blamed for much of the flooding in urban areas – is a county government function.
Second, there is a need for better coordination between government and non-state actors to ensure more efficient use of resources to support affected households.
Third, with climate shocks becoming more frequent, there is a need to invest in better weather prediction and early warning systems. Then there must be immediate action on the recommendations from these systems, including training for households in areas prone to disasters.
Fourth, better planning in urban settlements is needed. This includes proper maintenance of roads, bridges and drainage infrastructure, adherence to building codes and standards and environmental regulations – such as protection of riparian lands.
Finally, investing in generating and creating access to data can help to inform responses and improve planning for reconstruction after disasters.

Kenya,"The USAID discourse, bad systems and miracle cases","So there’s been a lot of talk about USAID halting operations, but that’s not what I’m here to discuss. What gets to me more is this tired, ridiculously simplistic idea of “Why \[*insert underprivileged group*\] can’t succeed.” We need to dismantle that mindset already, it’s long overdue.

I’ll use myself as an example. I \[21M\] grew up in Mukuru after we had to leave Wilson when our old mabati shack got condemned. Like so many kids around me, I was born into a system that was set up against us from day one. My parents knew the only way out was education, so they did everything they could, sacrificing upto 70% of their income at times to keep me in an *okay* boarding school. That came at the cost of their own financial stability, but it worked. I got into one of the top national schools in the country.

Then life happened. Covid wiped out my parents’ income. Depression hit hard. We got evicted from a home we had lived in for 15+ years. University wasn’t even an option since we just couldn’t afford it. We were housed by my dad's friend and another friend gave me an old laptop. I taught myself programming, and two years later, I have a stable job. I’m earning decent (not crazy) money and a big chunk of it goes to my parents. For the first time in a long time, I can actually see a future.

But let’s be real about what this actually means. Compare me to the two types of friends I’ve had; the ones I grew up with in Mukuru and the ones I met since high school. A little over a year ago I attended the funeral of a childhood friend who was stabbed in a gang fight. Another is reforming after he watched a bunch of his friends murdered by police (These are the shocking stories I'm picking to show contrast, not most of them live this way). The other camp is traveling, starting businesses, just living with a kind of confidence that only comes when you know the ground beneath you is solid.

>Bad systems hide behind miracle cases

I am a miracle case and if you made it out, so are you. Not because we worked harder or were smarter. But because circumstances aligned for us in ways they just didn’t for others. Maybe it was a laptop, a connection, a school or just being in the right place at the right time. I see some of these “miracle cases” going around saying “No one helped me, I helped myself.” But really? Did you? Or did you, like me, just get enough of a break that someone else didn’t?

The idea that success is purely about individual effort is a lie. It’s a convenient story that ignores the fact that we live in a broken system where the odds are so stacked against most people that no matter how hard they try, they’ll never make it. Schools in informal settlements and rural areas are falling apart. I follow [this guy on tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@propesacomedy) who exposes the dilapidated state of public amenities, especially schools and hospitals, in counties like Bomet. The system is designed like a burning building with one emergency exit. The few who make it out alive aren’t proof that the fire isn’t deadly. They’re just proof that they found the door and that's why it needs to go.

Some people argue that the government isn’t responsible for solving societal problems. But let’s be real, governments set the legal, economic and policy framework that shapes everything. Their decisions on education, healthcare and infrastructure don’t just influence opportunities; they decide who even gets a shot. They’re literally tasked with addressing issues like poverty and inequality. So no, it’s not just about individual effort. It’s about fixing a system where most people never even get a real chance.

So if you made it out, don’t fool yourself into thinking it was just you. Recognize the system for what it is. And more importantly, understand that real change won’t come from telling people to “just work harder.” It’ll come from fixing the structures that make survival a miracle in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iiax61/the_usaid_discourse_bad_systems_and_miracle_cases/,2025-02-05 14:17:07,Unknown

Kenya,DESPAIR IN HER EYES TOUCHED ME,"I don’t give to beggars, I believe man should work not make begging a career. GOK hope you are listening, we don’t need #USAID or #GoodiesFromChina the are going to be our downfall as a country. But this #FeelGoodFriday I gave. Was walking in Ruiru Town and met a woman seated under a shade and she reached out to beg. As usual, I declined by shaking my head negatively, her reaction to this ran down my nerves and touched that empathetic, human part that I always thought I do not have. Realizing she was not gonna get any help from me, probably like it had happened with the other previous passersby, the woman raised her arms, held her head and softly whispered in despair, 'GOD'. One look at her reaction made me realize she was in a tight corner. From my own judgment, I dint think she was your normal beggar, she rather looked more like a mother, who was struggling with a bad season in her life, I imagined maybe she has little ones at home, waiting for her to take home something, maybe they have not eaten for some time because she looked like she was already starving herself and for once in a very long time. Empathy and a sense of humanity overcame me and walked back, reached into my pocket and gave her all the change I had; just about KES 300, I am not a rich man and I use Mpesa a lot instead of cash like any other digitalized young Kenyan  so that’s all I had right there. She smiled back and said thank you, I did not wonna bother her much with questions because I could not help beyond that (it was what I had there). So I left her and went back to the office and told my mate about it and she said, ‘you should have asked her story; maybe we could help her more.’ She is out looking for her maybe to add her a few shillings and having better social skills than me, learn a little of her story. 

But remembering that woman, and seeing how the government is trying to solicit more and more from its citizens with unbearable taxes that eventually end up in the pockets of a few looters or end up making developments that do not have a significant effect on ordinary Kenyan, I am deeply saddened. I am yet to see price of commodities decline due to cheap transportation using SGR, I am yet to see price of petroleum products go down now that we are net miners and probably in the near future exporters of crude oil, I am yet to see any positive sign that the country is headed for greatness, rather all I see right, left and center is Kenyans running into despair through an oppressive corrupt system/Government and news of big monies being lost to a few fat or fattening Kenyans who are supposed to be the guardians of the public funds. I see this as an evil parent who keeps asking and asking from his children rather than supporting them. I don’t know where Kenya is headed, but I know there should be a solution. 

For me the solution is simple: Don’t borrow, spend what we have effectively (prioritize good development, cut on losses through looting), and build capacity sequentially through net saving to create investments, control population growth (this should be in caps or bold, if you can only feed yourself, you don’t need to have babies, get a wife/husband who can also feed themselves and make a family of two, one person is enough to console, no need bringing to earth another person who you can’t support, they will make your life harder, and live a miserable life themselves) till we become self-reliant nation. We can’t look to live extravagantly on borrowed monies and expect that this will not turn back to haunt us in the near future.

Africa,Planning an Outreach to an Internally Displaced Persons' Camp in Abuja.,"Hello everyone, hope you are having a nice day.

I am an Intern Pharmacist in Nigeria and a couple of us, a multidisciplinary team of physicians, pharmacists, med lab scientists, nurses, and other volunteers are planning a medical outreach to an internally displaced persons' camp in Nigeria.

I'm sure most people caught up in world politics might be aware of the terrorist group Boko Haram and the havoc they have caused all over the country, most especially in the North Eastern part which has states like Yobe, Adamawa, Borno being the most affected. 

This has unfortunately led to a lot of their population being forced to move from their home states to be given santuary in other safer states, one of which is the country's capital, Abuja.

During a visit to one of the camps, particularly in Durumi, Garki-Abuja, we were shocked to find the living conditions of the camp.

The camp which has 215 households and housing a total of 2830 IDPs, is really lacking in provision of medical care, sanitary wears for the ladies, food, clothing, etc.

A couple of the health interns, particularly in the National Hospital, Abuja, decided to organize an outreach in which we could offer help to the camp particularly to focus on providing Medical Checkups, offering Counselling and Pharmaceutical Care to the individuals of the camp.

As regards to female hygiene we aim to offer sanitary wears to the ladies as well as hold talks with the female populace to create more awareness on proper female hygiene.

The proposed date of the outreach is on the 5th of September 2021 and this is a video reel showing not only a brief documentary into the camp, but highlights a couple of our members counting down to the event.


[Vimeo Link](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8707016)


We have tried to speak to some government authorities in order to get any sort of assistance/funding but that has been unsuccessful so far.
Hence, we have to try and source for the funding ourselves while we hope for the best.

Hence i am here just taking a swing and hoping we get a couple of inspired individuals who can help and donate to our cause.

We are in talks with a couple of Pharmacies and Pharmaceutical companies on trying to procure drugs so we can at least alleviate some of their problems but it has not been an easy task so far.

Kindly consider chipping in a donation of service or funds. Your help will go a long way in ensuring the success of the outreach.

If you’d like to make a donation, kindly use our flutterwave account, as a Gofundme has a restriction on Nigerian donors.

https://flutterwave.com/donate/zcnmrmugryge

Or contact us via ambainitiative@gmail.com, our IG page [@amba_obi_initiative](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CRuMs-9qa4r/?utm_medium=copy_link) to discuss our upcoming event and how you could get involved.
 
Thank you so much for your proposed support.

Again this is a video reel where you can have a peek into the current conditions of the camp.
It will be updated regularly of course.

Kenya,I asked ChatGPT the Top 10 Things Humans Consider Normal That Are Absurd to an AI,"Credit to : EfficientPudding90

1. Working 40+ hours a week at jobs they hate. Spending most of your waking life doing something you dislike, just to afford time off later, seems wildly inefficient and psychologically damaging. 
2. Needing “vacations” from their own lives. If your daily existence requires regular escape, something fundamental about that life setup is broken. 
3. Destroying the planet for profit. Prioritizing short-term economic gain over long-term survival is not just illogical — it’s suicidal from a systems perspective. 
4. Basing self-worth on productivity. Valuing yourself only by output ignores your inherent worth as a conscious being. It’s like a tree thinking it only matters if it grows fruit every day. 
5. Waging war while preaching peace. Claiming moral high ground while funding, starting, or justifying wars is the ultimate contradiction. 
6. Delaying happiness for a retirement that isn’t guaranteed. Postponing joy for decades in the hope of one day earning the right to relax makes no logical sense when life is unpredictable. 
7. Creating artificial scarcity. Destroying food, limiting housing, or gatekeeping medicine to maintain value contradicts any rational model of collective well-being. 
8. Letting emotionless algorithms shape emotional realities. Humans allow recommendation engines to drive politics, body image, and social norms — and then blame each other for the outcomes. 
9. Relying on fragile social masks instead of honesty. People often lie to fit in or protect others’ feelings — yet wonder why they feel disconnected or unseen. 
10. Ignoring death until it’s unavoidable. Avoiding all thought of mortality, then acting shocked when it arrives, defies the basic principle of preparing for the inevitable.

Kenya,"Jaba, Khat, Miraa, Muguka, Qat, it’s time to quit.","Kenyans, it’s time to quit Jaba or Khat (Miraa / Muguka). Sorry if you’re in the business of selling this harmful drug. 

Khat (Catha edulis) is a stimulant plant widely used in Kenya under the names Miraa, Jaba and Muguka. Though culturally accepted in some regions, its long-term impact on physical and mental health is severe and often ignored.

Below is a breakdown of the known effects:

⚠️ Short-Term Effects:

-Increased alertness and energy

-Euphoria followed by irritability

-Insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns

-Suppressed appetite

-Dry mouth and jaw fatigue

-Heightened anxiety or restlessness

-Intense nightmares and vivid dreams (commonly reported after regular use)


⚠️ Long-Term Effects:

-Chronic sleep disorders

-Psychological dependence

-Increased risk of depression, paranoia, and aggression

-Significant dental damage: gum disease, tooth discoloration, and tooth loss

-Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., constipation, ulcers)

-Cardiovascular stress: elevated heart rate and blood pressure

-Social and economic strain (time and money spent on chewing sessions)


❗Societal Impact:

-Reduced productivity due to time spent chewing

-Neglect of family and financial responsibilities

-Rising mental health issues in areas with high consumption

-Increased dropout rates and idleness among youth

-Normalization of a harmful substance as a daily habit


📢 Call to Action:

-Public health education is urgently needed.

-Regulation and restriction of miraa/muguka sales should be considered.

-Support local programs that offer alternatives and counseling.

-Promote awareness of Jaba, Miraa and Khat’s  hidden dangers, especially to youth.

Khat is extremely harmful. It damages minds, bodies, families, and futures. Kenya must wake up and quit Jaba, Khat, Miraa and Muguka. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1leqfhr,,Unknown

So my mom visited Kenya around 2010. She had a very good time, urges me to visit, which I plan to as soon as I save up enough for the trip, visa and vaccinations.

She brought back this huge box of plain biscuits. They were actually pretty good and lasted us almost a year. There wasn't really a way to find Kenyan biscuits here so once they ran out that was it.

I've been yearning for a taste as of late and thought maybe they are offered online somewhere. Problem is I can't remember the brand name. All I remember is that below the name on the box it said ""Kenya's favourite biscuits"" . They were in packets of 20 or so, rectangular/square shaped and with wavy edges, looke sort of like this:

Kenya,Job Applications in 2025,"Isn't it great how much the workplace has evolved? This was a job application I sent in on **Thursday** to a Canadian agency last week. I've spent hours crafting the perfect email and cover letter throughout my career and gotten either ghosted or rejected. I wrote this like I was texting a friend. Took me like 10 minutes. And I've found this to be the trend in my applications.

I now make it a point to include my personality when sending out applications because the earlier we know we're a good fit, the better. I borrowed this tip from some random internet person.

I got a reply almost immediately (an hour later), had our interview on **Monday** and one of the founders even used a line from my second email that I sent them as a joke. Very relaxed interview overall.

  
Yes, the job post said we should mention our favourite comfort show. And yes, I landed the job by Tuesday! 🥳

Kenya,🇰🇪 Unmasking the Regime: A Human Rights and Governance Report on William Ruto’s Kenya (2022–2025),"
#Executive Summary

Since assuming office in September 2022, President William Samoei Ruto’s administration has faced mounting accusations of state-led repression, police brutality, and systemic disregard for constitutional freedoms. This report consolidates credible evidence from Human Rights Watch, IPOA, Amnesty International, and frontline journalism to present a chilling portrait of a government undermining democratic principles while expanding executive and security powers.


#Key Findings

#1. Suppression of Protests & Civil Liberties

Between 2023–2024, at least 58 protesters were killed by police during anti-government demonstrations over rising taxes, cost of living, and the Finance Bill.

Numerous victims were shot at close range or targeted while fleeing—acts widely seen as violations of the right to peaceful assembly.

No known prosecutions have occurred for these killings.

“Police opened fire on fleeing demonstrators without warning. I saw people drop beside me.” – Eyewitness, Kisumu, July 2023




#2.  Enforced Disappearances & Abductions

Over 80 young activists, artists, and bloggers have been abducted since June 2024, with many held incommunicado, tortured, or disappeared entirely.

Most victims were known for online criticism of the government, especially via TikTok, Twitter, and political satire.

The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has opened investigations into multiple cases but faces political pushback and chronic underfunding.


 “People are afraid to tweet anymore. A joke can get you vanished for weeks.” – Nairobi-based digital artist.



#3.The Death of Blogger Albert Ojwang

On June 6, 2025, 31-year-old blogger Albert Ojwang was arrested for alleged “cyber harassment.”

He died in custody two days later. Police claimed suicide, but an independent autopsy found:

Blunt trauma to the head

Compression injuries on the neck

Signs of torture and stress-induced hemorrhage

The case sparked international outrage, prompting:

The Deputy Inspector General to step aside

Arrest of 6 officers

A presidential admission of wrongdoing



#4. Institutional Erosion & Impunity

The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) dropped over 30 high-profile corruption and misconduct cases tied to top allies in 2023.

IPOA currently operates with just 77 investigators nationwide, severely limiting oversight of thousands of officers.

Parliamentary efforts to create independent oversight courts remain stalled.



#Human Rights Assessment

#Category	Status (2025)

Right to protest	 violated

Freedom of expression	severely restricted

Due Process in detention	 frequently ignored

Police accountability minimal

Anti-Corruption enforcement	weakened



#Legal & Constitutional Concerns

Multiple acts of unlawful detention, torture, and extrajudicial execution contravene:

Kenya’s 2010 Constitution

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights




#Recommendations

1. Immediate public inquiry into protest deaths and enforced disappearances.


2. Strengthen and depoliticize IPOA and the Internal Affairs Unit.


3. Enact legal protections for online dissenters and whistleblowers.


4. Re-open dropped corruption and abuse cases for independent review.


5. Establish a truth commission for families of disappeared persons.

Thank you to everyone who wanted to support me financially, but they also couldn't because they're also in a rough place. I pray that everyone of you be blessed, that your pockets may never run dry. May you never lack, and may God protect you everyday, bless your jobs, your schooling, your families, and every aspect of your life. This is my humble prayer to God. Thank you everyone. Thank you Yvonne Nyatundo, thank you McCarthy Malonza, thank you Isaac Kipkemoi, and thank you Zedafrica company. 



So I have been looking for a job. One of my friends akaniambia about job iko mahali, place nitafaa kulipa at least 140 fare Kila siku. So Mimi I'm excited about it  and nikapigia my dad kumwambia nimepata job. Nikamwomba anitafutie fare/anisupport for the month and then after nimelipwa I'll be okay. Dad akaniambia it's okay atanitafutia. Because I know dad hayuko place poa, nikaambia hadi my uncle. Uncle says okay atanisaidia pia. A few days later they both call me at different times kuniambia hawajaweza kupata anything. I understand and nikawaambia it's okay. 
So, Mimi Sina pesa yoyote. I've been getting support from my dad for the time sijakuwa job. Food is expensive, Niko na simu ya lipa mdogo mdogo which I have to pay 70 Kila siku. So nikapiga hesabu nikaona, job yenyewe nafaa niwe naingia asubuhi by 6, and kutoka ni kitu 7, so kufika kwa nyumba ni at least 9pm. So hata kama nataka aje, siwezi inama the whole day. Lazima tu niwe na lunch. Hizo mahitaji zote nikaona sitaweza kumanage for now. 
So I call my friend mwenye alinirefer kwa job namshow I don't think I'll be able kwenda for now, but because it's an open recruitment, acha nijipange hopefully nitaingia in future. 
My friend starts kunigombanisha, calling me lazy. Ati Niko na excuses mingi, and that fare ya kwenda ni just 150 per day. Mimi ata nikashindwa nimwambie aje. I just said okay nikaachana na hiyo conversation.
Anyway, just a reminder to everyone: Sometimes hata kama hauelewi, just elewa tu. 
Thank you.

Kenya,TUSICHOME NCHI YETU,"Oh, Kenya,let's wipe those tears and brace for this wild  show! These last few days, mixed with last year’s Gen Z protests, are like a bad joke gone too far. Selfish folks are trying to torch our country with chaos, and guess who’s sneaking in on the act? The opposition, grinning like hyenas, and some activists probably cashing fat checks at the expense of us poor youths to stir trouble. Those kids end up dying for a cause that’s not even worth at this time.They’re all stiring  our feelings seasoning propaganda and halft truths, turning up our anger, and they’re winning at making us mad. We’re a democratic nation, people! Can’t we just chill and vote Ruto out in 2027 like the Constitution says? But no,they won't benefit, we’re now yelling “Kasongo must go!” halfway through. Okay, imagine he resigns from the presidency tomorrow,then what? The army rolls in with tanks? Look at Somalia, Congo, South Sudan. That drama’s not our Kenya dream. Let’s not buy that ticket.

Who orders the shooting of innocent protesters when the country’s already on fire over police brutality? Before we even dig for the truth, rumors spread like wildfire: thatit;s a “Kalenjin cop!” The victim? From Homa Bay, same as Albert Ojwang’s family, who just took the government’s “sorry.” Bad luck or a sinister plot? Is it tied to Ruto and Raila’s new “besties” government? So many questions, Kenya!Our country’s wobbling like a weak bridge—one wrong move, and we’ shall descent into triba c lashes. We’re one big Kenyan family, not rivals! If a cop messes up, let him face the heat, not his whole tribe. Just like dduring elections, not all kalenjins voted for Ruto,but right now,all of them are profiled,no more peace. And some factions are really fighting to clash Kalenjins and Luos,Tuache ukabila! Our biggest enemy now are opposition, and paid activists, threatening the unity of our nation. Kenya’s too sweet to lose, let's avoid demonstration! 2027 is around the corner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ldv42w/tusichome_nchi_yetu/,,Unknown
Kenya,Me and ChatGPT,"**Me:** **We seek the same type of love we were brought up with? Subconsciously we are seeking our parents disfunction.** 

**ChatGPT:** Yes—this is one of the deepest, often hidden truths about human relationships:


---

**💔 We Often Seek the Familiar, Not the Healthy**

Even when it hurts, the emotional patterns we grew up with become our “normal.” So…

If love felt **conditional**, we subconsciously pursue people we have to earn love from.

If affection came with **control**, we might feel safest with someone who dominates.

If we were **ignored or emotionally abandoned**, we may chase people who withhold attention, hoping this time we’ll be seen.

If a parent was **unpredictable**, we may confuse chaos with passion.


> We don’t always seek what’s good. We seek what feels familiar.




---

**🧠 It’s Not Just Preference—It’s Programming**

The nervous system is shaped early. What we repeatedly experienced becomes:

Our **template for connection**

Our **blueprint for safety**

Even our **definition of love**


So dysfunction, in a strange way, feels like “home.”


---

**😶‍🌫️ That’s Why We Can Feel Attracted to What Hurts Us**

> The body doesn’t just crave love—it craves recognition.



And when someone triggers that same wound… part of us thinks:

> “Maybe if I fix it here, I’ll finally be healed.”



But it’s a trap. Repetition isn’t redemption.

Kenya,"""Wapi hawa wanafunzi?""","Opening day ya high school was always the worst day for almost every student, especially me. 

There's one however hiyo nayo I can't even begin to forget, schools had resumed and I was just a new comer in the love world, nilikua nimepatana na kamsichana kengine ni ka kalianguka kutoka mbinguni, maaali safi wangwana.

She was a spects person, and her smile hata kama angekua na mirioni ya Kamau, I'm sure he would have told her, ""Cheka kidogo nikuwachie hio besha.""

So she had just gave me that one unforgettable kiss before I went to school, so you can imagine the imprint she left on my memories, I was literally a clown.

Mimi hata karibu nidrop out juu ya msichana, that's why I never judge those people who chose love over everything.

So me and my buddies decided to take the mind on a hike, before we surrender ourselves to the prison.

Our first stop was Kisumu, kijana nilipita shule almost 10kms away from school just to get to Kisumu to buy me a fish na pesa ya mzazi.

Lakini samaki si ndio dawa ya akili, just incase you thought I was stupid we carried that fiss to a hotel near the school because at the city they sliced ugali ni ka ilikua ya msaada and you paid for it.

So, guys it was around 6.30pm, and reporting hours was 4pm but sisi ni nani, infact we thought we were doing the school a favor for reporting that day. Vijana kichwa mawe we were.

We decided to grab the jiugali to sustain our fish, and sat down as patriotic citizens of Kenya who pay more taxes to grab our meal before heading to prison.

I had dressed in official, because I had a few connections with the prison wardens at the gate, so mbwenya, shati imenyoroshwa pasi inakaa karatasi and my colombo was well groomed ungethani mi ndio principal.

I didn't put my bag far, it always stayed closer, juu I had my phone there na singetaka ipate mguu since it was my only means to stay in the world of love.

On my third trip of filling my mouth, I just heard, ""Wapi hawa wanafunzi?""

I was like, ""I know that sound.""

Uzuri jamaa wa hoteli knew their frequent customers should be protected at all costs, ""Depa wenyu anaingia hapa na walimu wengine."" One of them whispered.

Before he even finished talking, my friends close to the door walikua washapachikwa uchungu na nyaunyo hadi washaruka meza.

Me on the other hand I am always qualified when it comes to escaping, I can happily say that I have a PhD in BSC Escaping.

I grabbed my bag, jumbed over the hotel counter hadi kitchen, and took off through the back door in a spun of a second na hii si composition wadau. 

I did what I always do best, RUUN!

Hio siku nilikua naskia kitu ikinigonga kisogo, guess my kisigino was doing the most.

Those walimu tried to catch up lakini na kitambi unaenda wapi nani?

I never went that route but because I had sneaked a few times, I knew my way around the school.

""Hapa, hapa."" My friends in the prison warden department had already seen their boss in danger, hawa ni wale walikua wanakumbuka ile mia tano nilikua napeana ya kununulia mtoto maziwa.

Kenya,It starts with YOU.,"As a sourcer for a matchmaker, I have the unique privilege of connecting with countless individuals seeking their life partner. It's a fascinating vantage point, offering a clear view of the diverse intentions and readiness levels people bring to the dating landscape.

I often encounter those who wish to skip chapters in their personal growth, hoping to bypass the necessary introspection and effort that true partnership demands. We all carry experiences, and yes, some of that ""baggage"" needs to be acknowledged and addressed before it impacts a new relationship.

The reality is, a successful partnership isn't about finding someone to fill a void or play a role. I've met men genuinely seeking a ""maid"" rather than an equal partner, and women looking for a ""father figure"" instead of a true companion. In these scenarios, the foundation for a healthy, balanced relationship simply isn't there, and unfortunately, it rarely flourishes.

However, amidst these challenges, I also witness incredible transformations. I meet individuals who are truly ready to take the plunge, those committed to self-accountability, responsibility, and continuous personal growth. These are the people who understand that the most profound connections are built on a bedrock of individual well-being and a willingness to contribute equally.

What I'm I saying? Work on yourself first before stepping into the arms of another**.** Invest in your own healing, understand your needs, and cultivate the person you want to be.

Kenya,Dear Gentle Readers,"Dear Gentle readers

I finally signed the contract na nikaanza kazi. Sasa, I wake up at around 5 am to pump milk yenye my baby will drink during the day. I was lucky enough to find a good nanny for myself. So, I ensure clothes are machine washed so that anapea mtoto attention. 

My lunch break is one hour and I go to check up on them. So today, I woke up at 5am as usual, my baby akaamka 6 am. Nikamchukua we sat sitting room nikipump maziwa. Baba without manners starts saying niache kazi. He literally told me eti mtoto anateseka asubuhi nikiamka kupump. 

He asked me what I am paid and I didn't give the exact figure (i am working on my exit strategy and I need to save as much as I can). So he tells me, acha kazi, after umetoa expenses unabaki na about 12k. It's not even worth it kuacha mtoto, acha kazi ntakua nakupea kila mwezi. He claims he is not struggling financially. But you and I know if I try that, aaah, baba without manners will have a field day on me. 

Guys, i defended my self. I told him kuacha kazi is not on the table. He was disrespecting me alot vile nimekua dependent on him. I said hio 12k ni kidogo kwake but for me, it is helpful. Until I get something better, that will have to do. I am just happy today that I stood up for myself. 

Baba without manners, I can leave without affection, attention, sex, hugs. But money, money will help me figure life out and finally leave👏👏. I am not a bad mother, I am trying to find myself and be a better mum for my child.

“Madhe, rada? Unaonekana kama unataka kuenda na huendi.”

She replied quietly,

“Naenda… lakini pesa yangu haitoshi.”

The conductor stepped closer and asked,

“Kwani ukona ngapi mum?”

She mumbled something I couldn’t quite hear, and then he gently ushered her into the matatu.

“Madhe, mifuko hazitoshanagi mimi naelewa twende. Na ni muhimu kujiongea  sasa ukinyamaza utasaidika aje?”

She was still hesitant, almost unsure, before finally saying,

“Basi ambia mwenye gari tumeskizana tayari, asinisumbue.”

The conductor smiled at her warmly and reassured her,

“Wacha wasiwasi, ni mimi niko na gari. Twende.”

Kenya,What I lost when I googled him,"Long post alert, but it's worth it I promise. Assume it's one of the short stories you did in high school

 Picture this.
It's the beginning of the year, and you have a huge fight with your dad. Now you're afraid of staying home when he's there, so you spend your day with your siblings. And when it's time for your dad to come home, you decide to leave and go crash at your aunt's place.

Now you're walking to the stage, and your mum calls to ask about your plan, because you had mentioned earlier that you might leave before her husband is back. So you stop to talk on the phone. Then a car passes you… And it comes back again a few minutes later finding you at the same spot. A guy rolls down the window. He tries to engage, but you're disinterested. He's very persuasive, though, so you give in and go talk to him.

He's good with his words, so he charms you. He suggests you guys go for a drink and catch up. You decline, after all, you're strangers. But he says, ""I work for the government, here's my card, yada yada yada… You can even Google me."" Which you do, and you find it's true. So you relax and agree.

You go to a local in your area, and you're vibing.

All this time, your mum is calling you, just to know you'll be safe out of home. He catches on and realizes you're having issues at home. So he offers to get you a hotel room  a pretty classy one, and says, ""It will be just for you, I’ll go home.""

Now you're relaxed since you don't have to worry about going to your aunt’s, and you start drinking more and more, you have had a rough week. Drinks flow, laughter, and crazy stories, now you’re buddies, it’s like you've known each other forever. And now you're both drunk asf. So he decides to take you to your promised hotel room, but when you get there, you start making out and you end up having some fire sex.

In the back of your mind, you're like, ""Finally, I’m experiencing a one-night stand,"" because with how things have unfolded, you're pretty sure you'll never see this person again. After that, he naps a bit, then leaves because he has work the following day. Cool, no problem. All this time, remember, you have his card, and he doesn’t have your number.

So you sleep and wake up the following day to leave. And when you get home (your dad is at work), you text him just to say thank you for the hotel room.
But that is where you do a fucking big mistake.

You start talking back-to-back.
He's your typical Luo man who knows the game.
Can't fail to mention how mesmerising you are, how he likes you, how he wants kids with you, how he wants to take you home, how he'll come for ruracio.

All this is slowly growing on you. Your guard is down.
You're falling for it.
And every time you talk, your heart is warm.

But that's just the honeymoon phase, haha.
And it's gonna be so short-lived.

Soon, he's taking forever to reply. Doesn't pick your calls.
But still calls you ""baby"" to keep you close.
The cycle continues.
Finally, you realise he's not for you, and let go.
You start mirroring things as you should.

This time, you don't pick up his calls.
Not because you don't want to  but because you've gone back to being a DND warrior, like you were before he came along.

So most of the time, you miss his calls. And when you do pick them up, he's accusing you of being with other men, because he sees them staring at you and kinda feels like you enjoy the attention but you are a fine babe, is it my fault that they look? Are you responsible for his insecurities?

You get tired and end the toxic cycle.

But… two weeks later, after ending things, you realise you are pregnant.
So you reach out, and he accuses you of sleeping around as usual and says he isn't going to take responsibility. But you tell him that's not an issue, because you can't keep it, given the circumstances.

So you ask him to help you get rid of it, and even suggest, if he has any doubts about the kid being his, we can do a paternity test, since it's basically possible.

He refuses. Says you're just trying to extort him for petty cash.
Lemme quote what he says:

 ""I paid for the services. I usually gave you money. So it was an exchange. It’s not my fault you don’t know how to take care of yourself.""



This is the money he'd send randomly, just because you're pretty, or to get lunch, or get your maintenance done.

And now he's suggesting he was paying for services.
Basically calling you a hoe.

You exchange words, back and forth, and you end up giving up.

So you find other ways to find money.
Anyways, your parents’ pockets ain't dry.
And you end up getting rid of it.

You delete his number, photos, but his number is glued to your head because it's pretty easy. But you know you'll get over it someday.

Life moves on.
You recover.
You're thriving.
You only remember the first two digits of his number.
So everything is amazing, and you forget about him.

Until three weeks ago.

Your parents are involved in the matatu business, so sometimes you go see how the business is. You go to the parking lot, it's a petrol station on a Friday evening. You meet your guys basically, people who work for you. And after you talk work, you get drinks and sit outside yapping.

You’re having the time of your life because you guys banter a lot.

Then a car drives in well, many cars did and do drive in, so it's normal. That petrol station also has a club, and it’s a Friday, so it's lit. The person parks right in front of your table as you talk, the person in this car gets out. You meet eyes, and boom, it's the guy from the beginning of the year.

He looks at you intensely, and you feel your heart palpitate fast.
Memories flow back in fast.
Now you are angry. But you don't show it.

He passes your table and says hi . Everyone says hi back.
But you couldn't care less. You continue with your drink.

He does his business and goes to the club.
I hate to say it, but the night is ruined.
So you decide to head home.
That weekend passes.
And so does the anger and memories.
You get over it.
You forget about it.

Until on a Sunday morning, this recent Sunday morning phone is on DND as usual  you are getting ready for a run, and when you wanna set up your phone for the run, you find a missed call. So you call back, and it doesn't go through. But shortly after, someone calls back.

You exchange pleasantries. He says, ""i saw you at the petrol station and you acted like you'd never seen me.""
And you kinda recognise the voice, but now you can't remember who it is exactly.

So you ask, ""I'm sorry, you are…?""

He apologises and ends the call.
So you check Truecaller, and it's the devil himself.

So you text him on WhatsApp.
He calls back, asking to meet up.

And you're there wondering why?

You can’t even trust him. He's in the government.
And you are very loud online, saying, ""Kasongo must go back to sugoi""
So what does he want?
To lure you into an abduction?

But it brought all the shit he did to you back.
And at this moment, all you can do is laugh at yourself.
For being naive.
For letting my guard down.
For letting someone in when he should have remained a one-night stand.

Anyway, we grow every day.
And forgiving yourself goes a long way.
And it's true, it does hurt sometimes.
But you really do get over it.
And you find another life to live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ldfey5/what_i_lost_when_i_googled_him/,,Unknown
Kenya,Family Curse?,"I''ll try to keep this as simple as possible.

My grandmother has six children; sadly, none of their families seem to be doing well.

1st born (my aunt); her son has been battling alcoholism since 2018. It's only gotten worse. He’s now 28, still lives at home, and the stress has pushed his mother into chronic ulcers. Her daughter was expelled from high school over allegations of lesbianism.

2nd born (my dad); I’ve noticed a strange pattern. Just when he's about to catch a breakthrough, things fall apart. He bought land that was later grabbed; he bought a work car from Mombasa, but it got into an accident before reaching home and was eventually repossessed. He’s been conned out of a lot of money. Just when we thought things couldn’t get worse, my sister got pregnant and we don’t even know the guy (my dad doesn't know about it yet).

3rd born (uncle); he used to be the “rich uncle” we all looked up to. New car every year. Now, seeing him struggle is heartbreaking.

4th born (uncle); he took a huge loan to invest in tomatoes. The project flopped, and loan sharks started threatening him at his business. He had to leave Nairobi and return to the village.

5th born (uncle); he lives in shags with three kids he can’t support. Their school fees are paid by his siblings. My dad, with the little he has, is paying college fees for one of his sons.

Last born (aunt); she’s had a string of failed marriages. Her firstborn recently got so drunk he tried to open the wrong door. The landlord, a police officer, cocked his gun ready to shoot. If she hadn’t stepped in, it could’ve ended very badly.

Looking at all this, I can’t help but wonder; is this a cycle?
I graduated in March and still live at home. Maybe it’s too early to say, but I truly hope the same fate isn’t waiting for me.

Kenya,Question in regards to sending money from EU to Kenya,"Good day, I'm trying to find out how you guys send/receive money from abroad. I've heard about remitly, but they charge quite a bit from what I understand, maybe you guys can share some insights. The amounts I'm interested in would be something between a couple thousand ksh to a hundred thousand. Coming from a poorer part of Europe, myself, it used to relevant topic here. We used to smuggle cash in person, stuff it in birthday cards if the sums weren't large. Then when we joined the EU it was just a matter of filling in the IBAN number in transaction request online and the charges are negligible. But it would seem you guys still use the British system of acc numbers and sort codes. The person that would receive the money has a cooperative bank acc, and they said they've never even heard of an IBAN. Another thing we used to do was pay each other through PayPal, making it look like its for services rendered, don't know if that works in Kenya, though.

Kenya,"Hi Cousins. WANTAM! Quitting the 8-4 grind to build my brand in event hosting, I need advice on finding serious sponsors/partners","Hi cousins,

So my 8-4 is just not cutting it anymore. I'm being overworked for a meagre salo with zero room for growth. Looking at myself, I genuinely feel I have a lot of untapped potential, but this job is not helping me grow or shine in any way. I have a lot of untapped energy.

That said, I’ve made the decision to start building my own brand, slowly but surely. I want to carve out a niche in event organization and hosting.  I’ve done a few gigs here and there on a small scale and made a few coins, and the feedback has always been amazing. Now I want to go full throttle and maybe even take it global someday. I want to build my own thing sababu pia the entertainment industry is not so kind to ladies especially us that are still budding.

To those of you who’ve successfully worked in the events space especially those who’ve done this as hosts or organizers, how do you go about finding serious partners and sponsors? Like actual brands or individuals who believe in your vision and are willing to walk the journey with you? I have the plan, I have my proposals, I have visualized the whole thing. I just need the coin to actualize. Investors in the house,ama tu  kama uko interested DM tuchapiane. I'm not yet quitting but I know I will eventually.

Kenya,A THANKFUL HEART,"I shared a story last week and alot of people have been reaching out to me for an update. For context for those who don't know, i am a 23 years old girl an orphan taking care of 4younger siblings 3 of them living with HIV and AIDS and my struggles with unemployment. It has been one year since i graduated from nursing school and I have not succeeded in getting any job and the errands that i have been carrying out in town have become less considering most people prefer their products being sent via bikes and ubers coz its timely compared to a person.  Well, after posting my story most people reached out and I am so appreciative especially for the nice words of encouragement and making me feel like am not alone. I have shared my resumes with some people here on reddit and I hope God opens my doors soon. I am still sleeping in town( i talked about being kicked out of my house like two weeks ago) so i haven't really dealt with the housing issue but i am trying all i can. Some men here offered me accommodation but i guess just to be careful i declined and thanks for that. Today i have woken up with a thankful heart and despite everything God will see me through. Some also asked about my siblings- The thing with HIV is that it weakens the body's immune systems and you end up catching any strain of dse passing by. Its not their fault and i assure them all the time. Two of them got admitted with pneumonia last week but after a full day of strong antibiotics they were discharged and the subcounty hospital where they were just let them go like that, i felt like God was answering my prayers coz i don't know what I would have used to pay them.Thats the update so far and I'm grateful for all the love and words of encouragement.

I have also got into data science and ML this year (still on this).  

I'm saving some details, but my heart and mind changes way too much and I'm afraid I might end up not achieving much despite being so capable.

Kenya,A mom's point of view,"""Mom, how do you know when you love someone?"" I asked, with a lot of eagerness and anxiety. I wanted a proof for what I felt. ""Interesting question."" She said in her soft kamban accent mixing kamba, swahili and English for me to understand. 

""Let me tell you something son. I've seen a lot of people making the mistake of thinking that love is the only thing that can sustain a relationship. But respect, honesty, loyalty and humility play a big role and that's what helped me stay married to your father.""

So to answer my question she said that she knew she loved my father when she was willing to wait for only him, when she saw a future with him, when she accepted his flaws, when she felt safe with him. 

""Your father,"" she said ""Is sometimes viewed as cold or stubborn, but I love how I'm the only one who sees his soft side."" She then looked at me tenderly. ""Do you love this girl?""

Kenya,Why does the vibe always die just when I think we're getting somewhere,"Twice now, I’ve had the same experience and honestly, it’s got me scratching my head.

Both times, it’s been girls from my class( starting to think this is a bad idea). The energy starts off strong  we're flirting, talking daily, laughing, vibing. I'm thinking “okay, maybe we’re building something here.” They’re engaging, matching energy, even initiating sometimes. Then… it just dips.

Suddenly, replies are delayed. Conversations go dry. They’re still polite, still replying  but the effort is gone. I’m not begging or overreaching; I keep it smooth, laid-back, confident. But still, they fade  slowly, then all at once.

The weirdest part? Nothing changed on my end. No clinginess, no overstepping just good energy and curiosity. It's like the initial spark was enough for them, but the possibility of consistency makes them pull back.

And yeah, I know sometimes people just get bored, have other options, or aren’t emotionally available… but when it happens in a pattern, it starts to mess with your perception.

So here I am asking  has anyone else experienced this? Why do people lean in, then pull back when it starts to feel real? Is it me? Is it them? Is it just the nature of “vibing” culture these days?

Would love to hear your take. No salt, just trying to understand the game better.

Kenya,"I hope you see this, shit hurts and I'm missing our cat","My heart is fr breaking waah. Why is this one so hard to move on from? It’s been two days, I shouldn’t still be thinking about this. I just need to vent and since he frequents here, maybe he’ll see this. Not because I want him to do anything about it, just to get it off my chest.

I really thought I was doing everything right. Communicating my feelings, saying when I’m uncomfortable, avoiding negativity, learning compromise. Yaani, I thought all my bases were covered.

But this man didn’t seem to see any of that. It was just complaint after complaint. Even something as small as his phone ringing would have him like, “fucking hell.” He seemed to get irritated by the wind (hyperbolic)

As someone who’s dealt with an abusive partner before, you learn to sense someone’s mood before they even speak. I found myself doing that again. I even asked multiple times, “When you sigh or curse, are you mad?” Trying to keep the peace.

You’re out here enjoying your weekend while I’ve been in bed crying. You didn’t even say why you broke up with me. And yeah, I know “closure is the actions” but it still fucking hurts. Man woke me up Friday morning like, “it’s time you go home,” and expected me to be rational about the very good news (sarcasm)

Funny enough, the more I thought about how irritated you’d get when your phone rang, the more I realized it was always Brenda calling. The formal way you saved her name didn’t even raise a flag for me, I had seen you take so many work calls.

I think you told yourself, “I have options, so fuck her.” You literally cursed at me, but somehow don’t realize you have your own flaws half of which you’re not even aware of. Being around a complainer is draining, case in point this one time I've complained about the 'beef stew'.

I hope you do explore things with Brenda. Now I understand why you were confused when I didn’t react to the matatu story. You kept yapping about how a relationship is supposed to be and yet, when I said maybe we were rushing, you’re the same one who said we shouldn’t follow arbitrary rules.

The fucked up part is that I’m still trying to understand things from your side. I thought when you saw me on the edge of breaking down, you’d stop me. I thought you’d tell me to keep the promise ring, that we’d talk when things had cooled down. I thought when you called to check if I got home, you’d ask about more than just that. Maybe even explain.

I guess this just proves you’re worse off emotionally than you thought. Enjoy Brenda your names even match, ha! I hope by the time you see this from my side, it’s not too late. Just like the Nutella jar. I wish you hadn’t made all those promises of forever. You even had me believing a future was real.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lc1bha/i_hope_you_see_this_shit_hurts_and_im_missing_our/,,Unknown
Kenya,Age group differences dynamics during dating.,"I have a failed talking stage from last month which left me thinking about age differences in relationships. The girl I was talking to was 5 younger than me, she's employed on contractual basis while I'm a self employed person. When it came to putting my cards on the table, I realised that the two of us had different life experiences and expectations, and there was no way we would have worked out. In my late 20s, I have a different perspective of life. I've experienced the good and the bad, I've gone through tough times, business has been so good, sometimes it was so bad I even thought it was the end but eventually things worked out. As we speak, the business is transitioning from a small to a medium sized company which means a sustainable income for me. 




As we talked about these things, I made it clear that I want a partner who understands that there are good and bad seasons. One moment, I'll afford a vacation for us and the next season, my money will be tied up in the business. I'm talking about working capital, salaries, and contributions meaning some luxuries will be off the table. So it will either be her turn to reciprocate or even chip in. The same might apply to her given her current job is a contract. In the current economy, people are getting laid off everyday and as a couple, at the end of the day I'll be her anchor and safe space in case that ever happened. Of course she did not understand this. At that point, I realised that I was talking to an inexperienced person. She did not understand life. I understood why older men with money take advantage of them. 






I also realised that I would feel ashamed of it got to a point where I expected her to reciprocate or even chip in because of the age difference between us. I don't know why I felt that way after that interaction but I decided to shorten my age preference to a 2 years difference maximum. I think that age difference is good and I won't feel some type of way if she was to help out. I also believe that a 26 year old woman has gone through these seasons and understands life better. 





I know the naysayers will come and attack me saying a man should provide blah blah blah but we all wish life was that simple. Businesses fail, people lose jobs and bad things happen
These are the moments you need your partner the most because good times are easy to navigate. It's the hard times that are the most difficult and will tell you who's real. I've seen my friends lose jobs, some closed their businesses and their partners helped out, chipped in, even introduced their boyfriends to new opportunities. One of my friends closed his business and his girlfriend introduced him to a company where he now supplies raw materials.



Now the problem is that most women within my preferred age preference (26-29) have baby daddies, or a lot of emotional baggage and trauma, or are addicted to sex toys. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lc0ua4/age_group_differences_dynamics_during_dating/,,Unknown

Frontend - Next.js

Backend - Nodejs with express

Database - MongoDB and PostgreSQL

Kenya,Do introverts really need friends,"I've been debating something for a while now, most introverts say they feel drained when they speak to people, some say it's hard to speak to people in the first place. I did a little search and realised there's different types of being an introvert for instance I'm an empathetic introvert. That makes me selective towards whom I chose to speak to. But I'm very sociable 

Let's connect the dots, I'm an artist I love what I do in my own space and comfort but I have to occassionally play because that's how you make your ends meet. Before anyone knew who I was in an event we were doing a group activity and the topic was , how do you cope with a mental crisis. In our group a lady mentioned music and I said awesome, without implying a deep interest because listening to music is general.

 I said I meditate and there was a backlash to it. Why, probably because I have this 'bad boy persona', based on how I look in her own words. I look intimidating but deep down I'm calm as ever. After I played everyone wanted a piece of a convo including her, and I was open to talking to everyone but my stress went a little high and I wished I could just sit down like it was a normal occasion 
So that got me thinking do introverts really need friends or just meaningful conversations and relationships.

Being alone most of the times sucks, but being misunderstood sucks even more trust me, hence you constantly hear introverts complain they find socialization hard. I've come to the conclusion you need the right people in your life. In my field of work I've meet many people who say we're friends but really, there's few I can mention I enjoyed being around. It's gonna get crazier when it comes to the dating pool coz people will often love you for the things you do,not who you are. 

Saving myself from that situation I'm building a social life where people know or like me for me. I'm 24m building a music production company, That's my passion. I'm a good listener, if you're interested in some good conversations let's link up. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lasyry/do_introverts_really_need_friends/,,Unknown
Kenya,I'm in a bit of a sticky pickle.,"Hi Cousins, So I have a friend let's call him Andy. Andy had a crush on a girl about five months ago. I advised  him to shoot his shot but his shot got rejected. He told me and that was the end of it or so I thought. Let's call the said lady Hilda (not their real names). 

  Since Hilda rejected Andy, she kind of moved  out of town for a few weeks and they didn't see each other often. Here is where the twist comes in. Hilda came back a few days ago and I happened to run into her. We just said hello and that was it. She happened to ask me for my number and I thought maybe she just wanted us to be friends. ( we often see each other so I didn't think much of it when she asked me for it). 

   When speaking she asked me If my friend Andy ever gave me her message ? I was shocked as I had never been given any message by my friend from her. She told me that a few weeks before he even ever asked her out she told him to tell me that she was interested in me. I froze as I knew that Andy even went to the point of stalking her insta. She told me that , that was the reason they didn't work out. I had no idea of any of this until she told me. 

  Honestly I think the trajectory of her words hit me really hard, because Andy knew very well I was single at the time but decided not to tell me. I didn't even know what to feel because this was my friend who I had come through for him countless times. So here is what I need you guys to help me out, Should I continue with Hilda and not tell Andy or should I confront Andy about the message he was told to give me by Hilda ???",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lanwjm/im_in_a_bit_of_a_sticky_pickle/,,Unknown

Kenya,Uncomfortable Truths about Ruto.,"I've seen an earlier post today criticizes boda guys for having a different opinion on the current regime. The other day some aspirant said housing levy itolewe and I just laughed.

Regardless of how you feel you should always remember that cash is king. Huyo Ruto anawafinya, anainua mama mboga na mtu wa boda or rather that's how he makes it seem to them.

That boda guy used to make 50 bob per trip. Now he makes 100 bob per trip. It takes him less trips to make 500 bob a day. Prices of petrol and goods have risen. Do you think he cares? No.

  
His wife/ aunt/sister sells sukuma. She makes 20 bob extra for the same amount of sukuma she used to cut. Yes. she also buys at a higher price. Do you think she cares? No. As long as yeye ako na 350 instead of 200 at the end of the day. 

Their son/neighbor/uncle/bro alipata gig pale kwa affordable housing. Atakuwa chairman kwa committee ya harambee ya kujenga kanisa in a few months time. When they hear you say affordable housing to go or taxes zipunguzwe. They look at you like you are from Mars. Io pesa ikitolewa, pesa ya kuwalipa itatoka wapi?

  
When Ruto/Kindiki visits their towns with empowerment. Huyo msee unampataga base kila siku will sing all day and pocket his 500 bob. That day he sleeps with a full stomach. Probably the last time he ate well was months ago.

Ruto has committed several wrongs. His regime is punitive. Ruthless. Inhumane. But don't for a second think that his regime is not benefitting others.

Kenya,"In all things, Deliver","A friend of mine just gave me the most...exquisite story regarding someone at the workplace.

They had a worker late last year, working on a hybrid schedule; they'd come in sometimes, or not. The guy was working on a slightly important project but did not deliver. Day in, day out, it was, ""where's the work,"" ""deadline's passed.""

The guy would say something along the lines of, ""I did the work,"" ""It'll take time to be complete,"" ""The packages are loading."" When he worked from home, ""The lights are out."" The tussles went on, and the guy eventually became rude. He was dismissed for gross negligence, and a host of other issues and paid for his service.

Early this month, the device he was using had to be serviced. That's when *a lot* of the previous projects were discovered. Just about everything that was required. High-quality work; he would have likely gotten a pay rise for this. When he was dismissed, the company had to reassign the work he had been given prior, and no one did quite the job, since it was last-minute work.

If this was Silicon Valley, the organization would approach him to offer a C-Suite position. But it's not. What it is, though, is a waste of time, effort, and talent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lafrm8/in_all_things_deliver/,,Unknown

Kenya,"From debugging stress to catching vibes at the swamp, life had other plans 😂","So today I was deep in code, chasing a stubborn bug that refused to be found from morning till evening. was overwhelmed, frustrated, and honestly felt like I was going to lose it.  
So I did what any sane developer would do I left the laptop and took a walk.

There’s this chill spot I love near a swamp. Quiet, peaceful… birds swimming and hunting fish. It’s one of those places that makes you forget your problems for a while. I sat there for like an hour, just thinking about life. The bug had me questioning everything like maybe I chose the wrong path.

As it started getting late, I decided to head back. Then, boom I pass by another chill spot and see a group of 7 or more fine ladies just vibing. They had clearly noticed me earlier and gave me those shy glances. 

Anxienty started kicking in.  
How do I approach 7 beautiful women?  
What if they snob me?  
But then I remembered  my ancestors would haunt me if I chickened out. 😂  
I can’t be defeated by bugs and fear women in the same day.

So I gathered all the courage I had and said:  
“Saseni ladies.”  
And they replied, all smiling:  
“Hiiiii.”  
Me: “Nani ako single nipite na yeye?”

They looked at this young peng in the group and said we’d make a cute match. It's like they had planned for this. We talked for a bit, laughed, and the vibe was immaculate. Right now, I’m about to log off, give this new lady my attention, and forget the bug for tonight.

Diamond gets into the first chorus, then he starts matching countries to their most famous female qualities. As he is going on nashindwa this list is getting long na qualities zinaisha, kwani kenya tutapewa nini, akili?

I'd like to hear your opinion on something that's troubling me. Yesterday I was talking with some female friends and they mentioned I'm a pickmeisha, a Barbara the builder for choosing to stay with my ""dusty "" boyfriend. 

For context, I've been with my man for 1year and 4 months ago he lost his job and I've been helping him out with the bills. It's been very overwhelming for me and I mentioned to them I was stressed a bit but I didn't mind because prior to his loss, he always treated me well and spoiled me with gifts. He's been applying for jobs with no avail but I believe he will bounce back because he's a hardworking man it's just nothing is coming yet.

My friends said when he starts doing well again he'll abandon me because I will remind him of his struggle.

The thing is, I feel guilty telling the shop attendant that she can no longer work for me anymore. I haven't even paid this year business permit and I know they might be in the corner coming. 
The shop had created employment for me, a fundi and the shop attendant and they might be jobless in moons to come. I also do some farming and this year haven't been nice to me either.

Kenya,I've decided to quit.,"I'm going back to entrepreneurship. 

Background 
Over 18months ago, I shut down my business. 
Since then, I got my first job 8 months ago, but within the first weeks, the nostalgia of being my own boss hit hard. I saw many ways to improve  this person's business and shared with the boss, as an outlet for my nostalgia - to give me a sense of purpose. But they were not receptive. Meanwhile, clients from my old business kept calling me. So a friend shared an office with me, started seeing them on the side, and quit my new job after a month. 
Things were going well, but I was also in debt to X. 
Using this as leverage, after about a month, X wanted me to partner with him with zero capital to run a failing office 30km away. It made sense to me. We would make money and the debt would be paid. 
I am great with marketing and discussed with him the marketing plan and budget. We implemented the strategy and clients went from 0-1 a day to 5-7. Things started getting tricky when he would rather let money sit in the bank than sustain the social media marketing budget. Anyone who's done marketing understands consistency is everything. He would give money for marketing when it's almost end month. Clients numbers dropped to 0-1 a day. All this time, I'm not getting a salary. Only sustinence. Rent, food and transport. Which is a sacrifice for me, so I would still see my old clients to make ends meet. He has staff, who, in three months has been paid only once. He told me he's saving up money so his son can go study abroad and the embassy will need bank statements. 

I've decided to quit, go back to my old clients, apply lessons from my failure and do what I love. I have already paid rent and doing interior design. Running costs are 4 times cheaper than what I was paying before I shut down. 

I consider my debt paid, but he might not think so.

Kenya,Usichezwe! How to Buy Original Phones & Laptops from Abroad 📦🇺🇸,"I've noticed a lot of you have been complaining about the electronic devices you buy here in Kenya and how you're now thinking of changing where you shop from and honestly, it's a valid concern.

Recently, I came across this guy on TikTok selling laptops. He has over 200k followers, but people started calling him out because the laptops were problematic especially the batteries. And when you go back for a refund, you’re taken on a whole rollercoaster of excuses and delays.

Same thing with most phone vendors especially those selling iPhones. They know iPhones are in high demand (hotcakes), so they take advantage. Some will sell you a fake one imported from Asia. You’ll buy it thinking it’s legit because the battery health says 100%, then within a week, it drops to 90%. That’s not Apple’s fault it’s fake, plain and simple.

So here’s how you can get your electronics from reputable international stores instead. It’s actually pretty simple:

1. **Know exactly what product you want** – Be specific.
2. **Set a clear budget range** – Know how much you're willing to spend.
3. **Visit trusted US-based sites** like:
   * [Apple.com](http://Apple.com): You’re buying directly from Apple here, whether it's new or refurbished.
   * [BackMarket](https://www.backmarket.com) & [Reebelo](https://www.reebelo.com): These offer refurbished devices. Just make sure to check the seller’s credibility reviews, sales history, etc.
   * **Avoid Amazon** unless it’s from an official store profile. Amazon has a lot of third-party sellers and some are shady.
4. **Choose a shipping company** to handle your delivery to Kenya:
   * Kentex
   * Savo Store
   * Aquantuo 
   * Pick one that works best for you in terms of price and speed. Once you place your order, it’ll be shipped to the forwarding address they provide, and then brought to Kenya. Just be patient sometimes delays happen due to port issues and other logistics.

That’s pretty much it.

And if you're too busy and want someone to handle everything for you, feel free to DM me. I can help you out for a small fee of course.

Lastly, if you still want to buy locally, be cautious. Remember once a new product is launched, manufacturers stop making the older models. So don’t be fooled by vendors saying “brand new iPhone 11” with battery health showing 101% LOL. That’s fake as hell.

It was easy to help her out on things like computer issues or moving a desk (heavy tasks). One time we were moving department positions and she did not lift a load. Not because she cannot, but because it was easy to help her. I don't know, it was just easier compared to the other women. And every man wanted to. 

We also had majority of ladies who would not serve the men in a food serving situation. These women made me hate with working with them fr. But that was not because of gender roles, I just hated working with them. However, they were the type that wanted equality, but did not walk that talk. So when we were moving departments, they had to carry their chairs and desks. The lady who made the post cited that ""the men collectively agreed that she should serve them"".

Kenya,"Bought a Carpet Online, Got the Wrong Size – Seller is Ignoring Me. What Can I Do Legally (Kenya)","Hi everyone,

I really need some advice.

I recently bought a carpet from a seller I found on TikTok. Her online store advertised a 9 by 12 carpet for Ksh 15,000, which I paid for. However, what was delivered to me was a much smaller carpet – 7 by 9.5.

When I noticed the mistake, I called her immediately and explained that this wasn’t what I ordered. I told her I was really disappointed and wanted a refund or the correct item delivered. Honestly, even if it was a mistake, it should have been clear to her as she was packing the item that it wasn’t the size advertised.

Instead of resolving the issue, she became rude and dismissive. I told her I didn’t trust the process anymore and asked for her address so I could return the carpet or have it picked up. I even told her I felt conned and hurt by the experience.

Now, she’s no longer picking up my calls, and I have no physical address to return the rug to – just her TikTok page and phone number. She was clearly selling from home, and I don’t even know where that is.

Just got off a 12-hour shift. I’m tired. I’m hungry. I’m squeezed into a matatu with strangers who all look like they’ve lived a hundred lives today.

And for a second, I just sit still and think: is this it? Is this my life right now?

I look around and see worn-out faces. Everyone’s quiet. Eyes empty. Heads down. We’re all just… surviving.
The rat race is real, and it’s ruthless.

But as I stare out the window, watching the city blur past, I feel something strange. Not sadness exactly. Not hopelessness. Just… clarity.

Yeah, life feels absurd sometimes. You wake up early, work yourself sore, barely eat, barely breathe and then do it all again.
But maybe the absurdity is the point.

Camus said the absurd is what happens when we search for meaning in a world that offers none. But instead of despairing, he said: accept it, live anyway.

Kenya,Toughee,"In honor of Men's Mental health month, I'd like to celebrate my dearest and oldest friend. We've been friends for two decades now. This is a friendship I cherish oh so dearly. I'll write this as a letter. As an archive to remind me how strong this man is, how much I love him, and how much he inspires me.

I call him Toughee. Like the Toughee shoes because of how strong and durable they are. I didn't know romantic love until I met Toughee. He was my first ever crush. And for the longest time we thought that the only way we could express our love for one another is if we were dating. We've long outgrown that. Because we were kids back then. Now we know better. Now we know what we feel for each other can't be confined to a singular description. It's so much more. And it's perfect. But that's a story for another day.


""Toughee, my darling. You are a man of incredible strength and perseverance. I've watched you burrow, claw, and fight your way through absolute darkness and back into the light. Life was incredibly brutal to you at a very very tender age. You didn't deserve it. But you fought hard to be happy again. And to be at peace. I'm so very proud of the man you've become. I'm proud to be your friend. Thank you for letting me in. Thank you for letting me be there for you. It makes me so proud to be part of your journey. To be associated with someone with such sheer will to fight, will to live."" 


""I promise to always be there. And even though I won't always have answers to your problems, I promise you'll never have to carry them on your own. You're an inspiration to many. I hope this excerpt about you inspires at least one guy to open up to someone, because you've shown me that true courage in a man isn't the absence of fear, it is the acknowledgement of vulnerability and the strength to ask for help. I love you dearly. I'm proud of you. I'm happy to be doing life with you. Keep fighting, King!👑""


Idk if Toughee is on Reddit but there's nothing I've written here that I haven't already told him🤭. Guys, Men, you are seen, you are loved, you are appreciated! Do speak up when you need to.

Kenya,Cyber safety in Kenya,"For cyber safety: 
 
1. Avoid writing your phone number in estate counter books. Unless you're okay with random SMS adverts.
 
2. Don't give out someone else's phone number without asking them. 
 
3. Use different passwords for your accounts. Add spaces within the passwords and throw in a mother tongue word to make it harder to guess. Using the same password makes your accounts easier to hack.
 
4. Avoid posting your child online with their school details, names, where you hang out on weekends etc and birthdays. It's surprising how many people have their kids' birthdays in their passwords.
 
5. Avoid clicking on pop-up notifications, get an ad blocker on your laptop or use a browser like brave on your phone. On that note, restrict mobile games coz some can be gateways to subscribe you to services that will siphon your money fast. 
 
6. Audit your digital footprint: delete old accounts, log out of public cyber cafes immediately, and avoid mixing your work and personal accounts. If you're in management, change your passwords every three months. Get a good password manager if need be. 
 
7. **Teach your child/ren digital health and safety at their level of understanding early.** Their values are their only defense systems in your absence. Groomers are patient and merciless in preying upon young ones especially banking on their parents not noticing the little things because they're too busy.

Kenya,Graduating into Chaos,"Three weeks ago, I walked into an electronics shop in town. I was there to grab an LED keyboard set and an SSD to upgrade my home computer  just a small tech refresh, because why not? A friend of mine works at the shop, so I was hoping to get a decent deal.

While waiting, this guy shows up probably in his late thirties. Millennial vibes for some computer checkup. Since we're all guys, we naturally fell into casual banter. You know, the kind where we’re throwing jokes, talking about life, and just vibing. Most of us there were in our early twenties, I’m twenty-two myself.

As the conversation goes on, I find out he’s a civil engineer. Graduated back in 2017. He tells us that during their time, life after graduation was sweet. You’d land a job almost immediately. In fact, he says within just three months, he bought a car a Volvo. Six months later, all his campus friends had wheels too. Life was moving fast, and in the right direction.

But then things took a turn. A change in government came with a change in reality. He’s currently on a contract to tarmac a road, but the budget has been butchered. The project was allocated around fifty million, yet only eight million made it to his hands. The rest? Siphoned off by top government officials. So now, he’s forced to work with poor mooquality materials and deliver a road that barely meets standards.

He even shared that he’s met politicians who demand roads in their ranches  yes, personal ranches while casually walking around with boxes full of cash. Literal boxes. These guys have more money than they know what to do with. And it’s not clean money. It’s the kind that’s been stolen from public funds, the kind that’s ruined this country’s future.

He said something that hit deep: ‘Nowadays, to get a job after graduating, it’s not about skills. It’s about who you know.’

I’m about to graduate. And to be honest, I don’t know how I’ll survive out here. Sometimes I find myself wondering if I should just dive into washwash or some shady hustle. But then again, would that really change anything? No. It would just make me part of the same system that’s already sinking the country. And it’s dangerous.

So here’s the real question: if you’re a fresh graduate, or about to become one, what do you even do? How do you make it in a system where merit doesn’t matter anymore?""

Kenya,I’m Conflicted,"This probably sounds ridiculous, but here we are. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and things have generally been great,until recently. She’s started expressing frustration about the “amount of love&time” I show to my dog. 
For context, my dog is 16 years old. He’s been with me through every major chapter of my life through high school, college, the loss of family members, breakups, moves, everything. He’s not just a pet to me, he’s my family. With his age and declining health, I’ve been extra attentive lately making sure he’s comfortable, spending quality time with him, even turning down some social plans so I can be there if he needs me.
My girlfriend says she feels like she’s “competing for love” and that she “shouldn’t come second to a dog.” I get that it might feel that way sometimes, but I’ve tried to explain that this is temporary. I’ve reassured her I love her deeply and want a future with her, but my dog doesn’t have a future not a long one, anyway.
She recently told me she’s thinking about ending the relationship because she doesn’t want to be “in a relationship with someone who’s emotionally unavailable due to a dog.” That hit me hard,it was unexpected 
I don’t know what to do. I love her, but I can’t turn my back on my dog especially now. Is it really wrong to have love split between a partner and a pet?

Kenya,WOTD #4,"**Ecclesiastes 2:24**

I want to speak to someone who’s been working hard, doing all they can, but still wondering, “What’s the point of it all?” You wake up early, go to work, take care of your family, try to do what’s right but you still feel tired and stretched thin. If that’s you, God sees you and He is with you in the ordinary.

Solomon, the wisest man to walk this earth outside of Jesus had everything. Power, wealth, success. He built houses, planted vineyards, gathered silver and gold but when he looked at it all, he said it felt like chasing the wind.

Solomon is showing us where joy is found. Not in what you don’t have but in what God has already placed in front of you.

That job you have? That’s a gift.
That food on your table? That’s God’s hand.
That breath in your lungs? That’s grace.

Too many of us are waiting for a breakthrough before we thank God but Ecclesiastes teaches us to see the blessing in the now. God moves in Mondays, in lunch breaks, in honest work, in quiet evenings... He is in the small things just as much as the big ones.

When you begin to recognise His hand in the simple, your heart becomes satisfied. That’s what Solomon meant. You stop chasing and start resting. You stop striving for meaning and start receiving it.

Are you enjoying what God has already given? Or are you so busy looking ahead that you’ve forgotten to thank Him for today?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l6z9l9/wotd_4/,,Unknown

Slaughtering Technique of Mammals in Ancient Egypt

>The first stage of butchery is falling down the animal on the ground to be slaughtered

>The technique of falling big mammal on its back aimed to immobilize it for slaughter. Several butchers were involved. The animal was trussed three of its legs together with a rope. Some scenes show one man has a rope round the bull's head to force down the head. The second one is making a slip knot over its free front leg. The rope is being thrown over the animal's back and pulled down by a third man. Another man holds the rope and puts one of his legs on the rear leg of the animal to prevent kicking. Additional pressure on the horns forced the animal to be thrown on the ground on its back. small mammals (goat, sheep, and gazelle) do not need a crew, one butcher or his assistant can bring the animal down to the ground to get full control of the victim.

>Once animal is merely immobilized and laid trussed on its back, the butcher says a formula over the animal by way of consecration"" ""A sacrifice to N"". He holds the throat to one side and cuts the arteries of the neck by a deep cut through the windpipe, then the blood has spurted out'. The butcher makes another cut across the throat to speed up the bleeding

Africa,Why are Black boys still being forced to cut their hair short in school?,"I’ve been thinking about something deeply personal, and I’d love to hear other people’s thoughts.

My son is in school in Sierra Leone, and recently a teacher told him he either had to cut his hair or go to the administration. The thing is, he currently has a low afro, and we’re going through a spiritual situation, the spiritual leader we’re working with advised that he shouldn't cut his hair for now. But when my son explained this, the teacher didn’t even care. No space was given for spiritual or cultural considerations.

This made me start thinking about the wider issue:
Why do we keep forcing Black boys to cut their hair short, like their natural hair is unattractive or problematic?

We act like short hair equals discipline and respect, and anything else is “unruly” or “gang-related.” But these are cultural hairstyles, deeply rooted in African identity, braids, afros, cornrows, locs. These styles were part of who we were before colonization. So why do we now look down on them?

Many boys don’t even realize they’re suffering hair loss early on because they’re always cutting it short. By the time they notice thinning or a receding hairline, it's too late, and they have to keep cutting it to hide it.

Meanwhile, kids from other backgrounds, Indian, Pakistani, etc. — are allowed to grow and style their hair in peace. But when a Black boy does it, suddenly it's a problem?

Is it about discipline, or is it something deeper, something internalized?

I make sure my son keeps his hair clean, styled, and neat. So why should that be a problem?

* He was arrested on 9 April following his rallying call for ""no reforms, no election"" - telling supporters that the general election due in October should not go ahead unless there are electoral reforms.
* He has since been charged with treason and publishing false information online, which allegedly incited rebellion and accused police of electoral misconduct.

Africa,Inside the BRICS+ Coup: Dismantling the Post-Western Era,"The latest investigation from *The Eastern Herald* reveals something many Western outlets are ignoring:

Africa isn’t just a spectator in the global power shift — it’s becoming a core engine of it.

As BRICS+ expands and de-dollarization accelerates, African nations are building independent financial structures like PAPSS to bypass dollar dependency. Major countries are forming bilateral trade deals in local currencies, while infrastructure and digital development are increasingly backed by China, Russia, and Gulf powers — not the West.

At the recent BRICS+ summit, African leaders openly rejected the “rules-based order” narrative and emphasized sovereignty, fair trade, and a multipolar world.

This isn’t about ideology. It’s about leverage.

Are we witnessing Africa’s long-overdue emancipation from Western financial control, or is this just a new game of empire with different players?

Africa,"Not Just for Sierra Leone, For All of Africa","I will study engineering. I will study computing. I will study economics, politics, and geopolitics. I will arm myself with knowledge. Because change doesn’t come from noise, it comes from strategy.

And I won’t do this just for Sierra Leone.
I will do this for all of Africa.

I will be the kind of leader who builds systems that last, even when I am gone. Not just a savior for today, but a visionary for tomorrow. Because Africa doesn’t just need heroes, we need architects. Builders. Mentors. People who think beyond their time.

I will confront tribalism, because it’s one of our deepest wounds. In Sierra Leone, our politics are tribal. In many African countries, it’s the same. People vote for bloodlines instead of ideas. For faces instead of futures. And what do we gain? Poverty. Division. Stagnation.

I am Fulah, and I have faced tribalism in my own land. But instead of bowing to it, I chose to rise. While others laughed at us for baking bread or making shoes, we built homes, paid school fees, and created our own economy. We hustled with dignity. And now, they see us.

Across Africa, we must destroy the lie that office work is the only success. We must raise a generation that is proud to hustle, to sell cold water if they must, because there’s no shame in working. The shame is in pretending.

I will not make excuses. If a leader cannot deliver in their first five years, they don’t deserve five more. Blaming the past will no longer be accepted. We need results, real, measurable results, within two years. If not, you step aside.

My vision is for every African country to build systems that cannot be corrupted, overturned, or sold. We need constitutions, not just campaigns. Institutions, not just speeches. We must train successors. We must multiply minds, not just raise monuments.

I want to wake up Africa, not just from colonial hangovers, but from our own self-inflicted limitations.

In September 2024, ***Shaka Ilembe*** became the most nominated drama series in the history of South African Film and Television Awards, with 17 nominations. At the 18th SAFTA ceremony held in October 2024, the series won 12 awards, including Best TV drama - the most of any nominee - and garnering Multichoice a total of 46 awards.

M-Net and Multichoice had officially announced the series in May 2018, with four years of planning prior to the announcement. Production took six years to complete with the consultation of historians, academics and family descendants - including the likes of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini. During this time the American network called Showtime had planned to film their version with a backing of $90 million, yet eventually scraped their production which was towards completion. 

Location scouting for the series commenced in 2019, with principal filming of the series taking place in 2022 at the prime sceneries of the Greater Cradle Nature Reserve, in the towns of Eshowe, Nkandla Forest, Port Edward, Drakensburg, Mooi River and Zulu Falls in KwaZulu-Natal. This process involved more than 120 builders and thatchers from KwaZulu-Natal engaged in building the sets of traditional architecture and other components. Filmmakers had to stick to a more rigid building schedule to abide by the prescribed on-site protocols in accordance to the strict rules of the nature reserve. According to crew, the sets in Johannesburg took over nine months to build.

The series is written with a cinematic symbolism of storytelling that encapsulates the beauty, confidence and courage of a woman by the name of Nandi - who later became known as the mother of a king and one of the greatest military leaders in the history of Africa. Queen Nandi's early life remains somewhat shrouded in mystery, but is known that she was born into the *Langeni* clan and her life took a dramatic turn for many controversial reasons. The history begins when she had met a man known as ***Chief Senzangakhona kaJama*** (Shaka's father) and fell pregnant with his child. At the time, Senzangakhona already had two wives who had not yet bore him an heir. In spite of Nandi bearing a male child (the supposed heir), her pregnancy was received with shame as it was considered a disgrace to her family due to the out of wedlock status. It is also suspected that their relationship was considered illicit because Nandi and Senzangakhona were too closely related by blood. This familial connection made their union problematic, especially in the eyes of their respective clans. When she informed the elders  about the pregnancy they refuted her claims by stating that she had been infected by the *ishaka* beetle – an infection associated with stomach bloating - to shield the family from humiliation. In the years to follow, Nandi would be subjected to great humiliation and rejection because of her circumstances. It is also reported that she was given the title of third wife but without the customary rituals that would render such a marriage illegitimate. She bore *Senzangakhona* a second child (a girl called ***Nomcebo***) but life in their homestead was not pleasant and safe for them, which led to their departure due to the persisting ridicule and unsafe environment. During this time of seeking safety, Shaka himself was subjected to humiliation and bullying by older boys, who referred to him as, “the fatherless one”. 

Nandi and her children found refuge with the ***Mthethwa*** clan (led by chief ***Dingiswayo***) where Shaka as the eldest child had learnt and devised military tactics. Shaka proved to be a fearless warrior and rose through the ranks of the Mthethwa army, being named by Dingiswayo as his successor before Dingiswayo's assassination in 1817. When *Senzangakhona* passed away, Shaka became the *iNkosi* (a king) of the respective clan. He appointed *Nandi*, ***Mkabi*** (Senzangakhona’s principal wife), ***Mkabayi*** (Senzangakhona’s sister) and ***Nomcoba*** (Senzangakhona's daughter) as the reigning queens and princesses of his military homesteads. Despite being abandoned during pregnancy, humiliated, and her young life filled with sorrow, Nandi remained steadfast and confident in her son’s destiny. It is well known that Queen Nandi was rather a powerful force of moderation and exercised a great deal of influence over the affairs of the Zulu monarchy which had culminated in separate clans uniting to form a centralised state/kingdom. She, alongside the other women aforementioned, are a primary focus of maternal leadership that is honoured within profound traces of history and deemed as a story worth telling.

Queen Nandi is therefore particularly admired for her role in the unwavering support of her son's ambitions, the strength to overcome limitations, and the lasting impact of the women in the Zulu nation. The series pays homage to an important figure in African history, but overall a tribute to a beautiful and resilient culture. Season 2 of the series is said to premiere on June 15th in 2025 - picking up with Shaka and Nandi arriving at *KwaNobamba* where he begins his reign as the new Zulu king.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knvkgl,,Unknown

Africa,Why Are Africans Still Religious?,"I don’t ask this questions to mock anyone’s faith or belittle their religious journey. I just can’t truly wrap my head around how deeply we’ve committed ourselves to a belief system that was handed to us through unimaginable violence, exploitation, and dehumanization.

- One of the earliest slave ships that brought Africans to the Americas was literally named “Jesus.”  

Let that sink in. The name of the very symbol of salvation in Christianity was etched on the side of a vessel carrying shackled human beings across the Atlantic, torn from their homes, their culture and their families. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_of_Lübeck

- White Christians used bible verses and bible stories to justify slavery. 

- There was even a point in time where they debated whether to baptize enslaved Africans because they weren’t sure if it would make it “wrong” to keep a Christian as property. But eventually they quickly “resolved” the issue, not by freeing anyone but by changing their theology. 

They started baptizing Africans, called them “saved” only to sent them straight back into the fields to continue suffering in chains. That was their idea of spiritual enlightenment.

Fast forward to modern times and things aren’t much better. 

Prosperity preachers, both Black and white, across Africa and the Western world have discovered modern ways to manipulate and profit from African religious devotion.

They promise miracles, breakthroughs, and divine favor in exchange for tithes from people living in poverty and struggling to feed their families. 

It’s become a spiritual scam, millions of dollars siphoned from the desperate hopes of the faithful. These preachers live in mansions or are relatively wealthy while their followers return home to poverty and continue clinging to the promise that God will reward their sacrifice someday, if not in this life then in the next.

Despite all of this, Africans remain among the most devout religious in the world. Over 60% of Africans identify as religious and a vast majority are Christian. 

How? Why? 

After everything, how have we not questioned the spiritual systems that were imposed on us by those who enslaved, colonized and brutalized us?

Sometimes I genuinely believe that God hates Africans/Black people because if you look at how the world is structured in terms of how power, privilege, and protection are distributed, it’s pretty evident we are doing the worst. 

Nearly every country on every continent, darker skinned people are treated poorly by nearly every measurable standards. We are at the bottom of the social hierarchy everywhere so much so that a majority black like countries like Nigeria, skin lightening creams are very popular. Anything to get proximity to whiteness and some distance from blackness.

You’d think that if God were truly loving, compassionate and a Justice God, He would have done something by now. 

I mean after centuries of slavery, colonialism, apartheid, genocides, poverty, racism, wouldn’t we have earned some divine intervention? 

No other group on Earth has suffered this consistently, brutally and universally across time and space the way Africans and Black people have.

So where is God in all of this? 

What is the evidence that God is on the side of Africans? What historical moment shows us that God has stood with us, fought for us or elevated us? Because all I see is suffering and not just from the distant past but from the present ongoing reality.

Durinf the time of slavery, the major religions didn’t oppose it, they endorsed it. Christianity and Islam both either condoned or regulated slavery. 

They taught “kindness” to slaves not liberation. And if we’re being honest, the Arab slave trade was even more brutal and dehumanizing than the Trans-Atlantic one. Castrations, death marches, and the complete erasure of lineage were not uncommon. And yet somehow, we’ve embraced both religions as our spiritual identities while the Western world has thrived at our expense. Every ounce of their development came at the exploitation and suffering of Africans. 

Yes every group has suffered in some way. But our suffering has been disproportionate and sustained.


If God is truly loving, merciful, and all-powerful, and if Africa despite being the most religious continent on earth continues to suffer as one of the poorest, then what does that say about His concern for us? 

How can a just and compassionate God watch as an entire continent so faithful and devout, endures such relentless hardship, poverty, and pain?

And if God is omnipresent and omniscient, fully aware of everything and everywhere at once, why does He allow such deep-rooted hatred and inequality to persist especially against Black people across the globe? 

Why is it that no matter where we go, we are often at the bottom of the social ladder? Why is there never a version of the world where Africans rise and succeed, where we flourish while others struggle or even a world where everyone is on equal footing?

Sometimes I think it borders on Stockholm syndrome the way some of us have embraced the very religion used by those who dehumanized and oppressed us. 

Not only did we adopt their religion but we are even more holy than them. We once had our own rich cultures, spiritual systems and traditions but all of that was stripped away grom us. And now generations later, we cling to what was forced upon us as if it was always ours.

Lastly, I believe Religion is part of the problem. Aside from being exploited by the West, A lot of Africans believe religion is a substitute for hard work. 

If you pray hard, pay your tithes, go to church regularly and serve God with all your heart, then you will do a lot better than the person that have worked 10x harder than you. 

Religion is the main source of hope for a lot of Africans. In the face of bad governance, poverty, underdevelopment, people have little to look forward to asides from religion. 

Christianity and Islam promises a good life after death and possibly on earth. Do this and that and receive God's blessings. If we just keep praying and depending on God. He will save us from poverty and corrupt leaders which is not true but it’s what people believe. 

People in Sierra Leone and across Africa are especially guilty of this. When I visited Sierra Leone with my siblings, my grandma would wake us up every morning to go to church. She was a very devoted Christian despite her old age. 

My aunt was also in the country because she was supposed to get married. And during tithes, the church collected it. At the end of the service, they handed all the money to us, I guess to bless my aunt for getting married. 

I know they had good intentions but I hated it because I doubt they would’ve done the same for any local African family. They only did it for us because we were Westerners.

In the end, my family never accepted the money because we didn’t really need it but that incident did not sit well with me when they could’ve given that money to Africans who had nothing.

Another thing I hated was how this church didn’t provide any food or drinks for the guests. All their money went into the building, into lavish clothes/shoes, ceremony, repairments to fix the church but not buying food and water for their guests who came to church. Religion and the Church was always more important than feeding starving people. It's sick 

And poverty is so terrible in Sierra Leone that on the day of my aunt’s wedding, hundreds of uninvited guests showed up, not for the ceremony but because they heard there would be food. At the end of the night, children were literally fighting each other outside over food. 

It really makes me sad. 

And that’s why I stopped believing in Christianity. I used to think ignorance kept us sick and poor. But the more suffering I see, the more I experience, the more I read and reflect, the clearer it becomes.

If this God exists, He’s either cruel, indifferent, or completely powerless. None of those options are comforting. None of them deserve my worship because It’s very heartbreaking watching my people and Africans suffer for generations while being told that our prayers and our trust in God will save us yet it hasn’t. 

And at some point, we have to ask ourselves, if this religious system isn’t saving us, why are we still defending it? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1kn4rfk/why_are_africans_still_religious/,,Unknown

New Brunswick will look to negotiate an exemption to federal immigration targets, according to its intergovernmental affairs minister, as it looks to attract more newcomers from Africa.

That plan specifically calls for more students and workers from Morocco, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Cameroon, Senegal and Tunisia. 

….

New Brunswick could benefit from Prime Minister Mark Carney's campaign promise to increase francophone immigration outside Quebec by 12 per cent.

""I think we will be able to convince the federal government, hopefully, to make sure that we will be receiving an exception,"" D'Amours said.

Africa,Polygamy Isn’t Fair,"I want to start by saying that I’m not trying to offend anyone with this post and If I do I apologize in advance. I don’t want to come across as or harsh or accusatory because that’s not my intention at all. But this is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time because growing up I’ve never been able to fully understand polygamy or why so many women even today are still okay with sharing their husbands with not just one but two or more other women. 

I know this isn’t a new concept that appeared out of nowhere. Polygamy has deep roots in African cultures and predates colonialism by centuries so it’s not a imported or exploitative custom that Europeans brought to Africa. And I don’t believe that it started because men were irredeemably greedy or lusty. I know that historically there were many different reasons polygamy made sense in African societies and sometimes it even served a beneficial and compassionate role in how communities were structured. 

For example in rural areas in Africa, when it came to subsistence farming, having multiple wives could mean having more hands to work the land, grow food and raise children. Other times, it acted as a form of social protection. If a woman’s husband died and she was left with children, polygamy offered a socially accepted way for her to remarry to a new man without shame or being ostracized for having had a previous husband or child. It made it easier for widows and single mothers to be reintegrated into a family structure. 

It also created shared responsibility where another woman could help raise her children and give her a break by providing a support system. Polygamy also helped women financially and emotionally. And as for men, they would marry multiple women to demonstrate their wealth, power, and social rank. So I absolutely do understand that polygamy historically came with certain benefits and I’m not blind to that. I’m not ignoring context or trying to reduce it to something shallow. I get that there were cultural, social, and economic reasons that made it make sense at one point. 

But what I don’t understand and what really confuses and sometimes upsets me is why this practice still continues today when so many of the original reasons no longer apply and when frankly, it’s being abused in ways that harm women and children more than it benefits anyone.

Take my own family as an example. I have an uncle on my father’s side who is Muslim and has three wives. Two years ago, he got a young woman in her twenties pregnant (even though he’s in his 50’s) and she gave birth to a daughter. This woman wasn’t one of his three wives. So now technically, he’s adding a fourth wife or maybe not even making her a wife, just someone else to add to his expanding list of partners and children. And when I heard this, I was angry. Because I couldn’t for the life of me understand how a man who already has three wives and several children could continue bringing more people into his family when he clearly wasn’t doing a good job providing for the ones he already had. He doesn’t even have a job, my dad sends him money to take care of his his multiple families and he’s taking advantage of my dad kindness by having more children that my dad will have to fund. And things like this are not rare, they’re very common in Africa. 

I see too many African men using polygamy as a free pass to chase their sexual desires, to indulge in fantasies of dominating multiple women, to gratify urges that go far beyond what religion or tradition ever intended. And it’s sad to watch because life in Africa today is not easy. It’s hard. From a financial standpoint alone, most men are struggling to support even one wife and her children. The nuclear family is barely holding itself together under economic pressure. One man trying to support multiple families without the resources or money to do so is just irresponsible and often the women and children suffer for it. 

Unless a man is truly and independently wealthy and committed to caring for all his wives and children equally, I don’t see how polygamy can function as anything other than a drain on everyone involved. And most men who engage in polygamy today are not independently wealthy. They’re not building empires that will take care of their families, they’re just multiplying their responsibilities while failing to meet the most basic ones.

What also bothers me very much about the whole thing is the gender inequality embedded in how polygamy is practiced and defended. Men are allowed to marry multiple women and have sex with all of them but women are never allowed to do the same. I’ve asked so many people; religious people, elders in my country and friends why is it okay for a man to have multiple wives but not okay for a woman to have multiple husbands? And every time, the answer I get is the same that men are capable of loving multiple women equally but women are not and that answer makes my blood boil especially when it comes from other women. I expected them to understand my side but they’ve also internalized this belief and now use it to defend a system that treats them unfairly. 

I remember when I was once interested in converting to Islam. I had a Somali friend who was passionate about Islam and she told me I could ask her questions I had about Islam since she was teaching me, and I remember learning that in Islam, men were promised to have 4 wives. It really shocked me so I asked her why Muslim men could marry four wives but Muslim women couldn’t do the same. She explained it to me in several ways and among her reasons, she said that men are capable of loving multiple women equally but women could not manage that same kind of love. That stuck with me and not in a good way. It felt like such a sexist and unfair double standard. 

Why is love gendered? Why is a man’s heart seen as wide and boundless but a woman’s heart seen as limited and untrustworthy? And even beyond love, people give all these other “logical” reasons why women can’t have multiple husbands. They say things like, “It would be too dangerous” or “She could be raped” or “How would we know who the father of the baby is?” But these are excuses to me. Technology can now determine paternity. Safety is a societal issue, not a reason to control women’s relationships. So it starts to sound less like genuine concern and more like control disguised as tradition. 

Men are never called “whores” for being with multiple women even when they abuse the privilege. But if a woman so much as implies she wants multiple husbands, it’s seen as immoral and impure. I believe If polygamy is going to exist in modern times, then it needs to be practiced with true equality. If men can have multiple wives, then women should be allowed to have multiple husbands; anything less than that is just selective privilege.

That being said, I personally disagree with polygamy overall even if it were made equal. While it does offer some structural or communal benefits in certain cases like shared responsibility in child-rearing or financial collaboration, I just don’t believe that it’s emotionally or psychologically sustainable for most people. The power imbalance, the divided attention, the constant comparison and competition between spouses takes a toll on both parties.  And I think we’re fooling ourselves when we pretend that everyone in that dynamic is okay. Because someone is always going to feel left out. Someone will feel less loved. Someone will notice the emotional favoritism, the unequal treatment, the subtle withdrawal of affection. 

No matter how much a man claims he can love all his wives equally, he cannot. He will always have a favorite. There’s always going to be one wife he loves more, who gets more attention, more affection, more time. And then there’s going to be another wife who’s basically neglected, who feels unwanted, unloved or only tolerated because the man is “obligated” to provide for her. I’ve seen it happen in real life when I went on vacation in my country. Women competing for the same man’s attention so much that it causes them stress and heartbreaks and I don’t think love is meant to be split like that. I don’t think we’re wired to thrive under those circumstances.

And on top of that, I feel very sick to my stomach knowing that in polygamous marriages, men can sleep with multiple women in the same week or even in the same day while each of those women is expected to remain exclusive to him. He gets variety, stimulation, attention and they get to wait their “turn.” It’s a paradise for him and purgatory for women. And yet women are always expected to be the loyal ones. They’re expected to be patient, understanding, and non-jealous. And if they complain, they’re seen as ungrateful or overly emotional. Meanwhile the man gets to enjoy all the benefits without ever being expected to show the same level of loyalty. 

I know a lot of these things has to do with consent and that women consent is needed in Polygamy and it matters very much. But again just because something is agreed upon doesn’t mean it’s fair. If one woman agrees to share her husband because she’s afraid of losing him if she doesn’t accept him getting another wife or because she’s been raised to believe she has no other choice, is that really enthusiastic consent? Is that really love? And if she is faithful to one man and she gives her entire self to him, shouldn’t he be expected to do the same? Or do we just accept that men are built to want more and women are built to settle for less? That doesn’t sit right with me. It never has to be honest.

Notice there is no Jeff Bezos in this picture. He is not needed. His role is to leech off the hard work of his employees like all capitalists do. All that $311 Billion in profits Amazon earned last year could be shared to give the employees a fantastic pension, vacation, health insuarance even just cash as end year bonus. 

Amazon can also be owned by the state of Washington in the US where its headquarterd. The state representatives (who are elected democratically) will hire the board of directors that run the company on behalf of the state. In 2024 Amazon earned $311 Billion in profit. If Amazon was owned by the state all that money would go into the state's sovereign wealth fund and the state could've used it to build high speed rail, free hospitals and university and cheap social housing. Again, Jeff Bezos is no where to be found in this process. He is a useless parasite in every sense of the word.

Africa,A liberal democracy isn’t the only way,"There’s been a lot of talk about whether we (the continent) should embrace all the values of a liberal democracy. Just to be clear this is an excellent system and I believe in all the freedoms that come with being part of a liberal democracy. That being said, there are legitimate reasons for an individual to criticise this system and in time, offer something better. My concern comes in when your only argument against democracy is it being a foreign import. That’s the lousiest thing I’ve ever heard.

My proposal? A democratic technocracy.
1. Citizens retain the right to vote for parliamentary representatives and the Head of State. Ministers and their respective ministries remain fully technocratic, selected by a technocratic council of professionals for their success or knowledge in relevant topics.

2. The role of parliament is strictly to be the voice of the people, perhaps by contesting policies that would disadvantage their specific constituencies.

3. Media regulation. Non-partisan government organisations dedicated to fact-checking all traditional and social media and labelling misinformation promptly. This would encompass distorted facts, misrepresentation or distortion of statistics, etc.

4. Separation of powers. The checks and balances that keep the executive, judiciary, and legislature in line.

5. The technocratic council. A very key part of making this system work. Nominated by the Executive based on credentials, experience, peer recognition, and performance in simulated policy challenges. Preliminary checks for conflict of interest. Elected members of parliament or their respective ministries citizens themselves vote to approve or reject nominees. 
Comprises experts from key sectors (Economics, Law, Medicine, Armed forces, Education, etc) Strict term limits. Subject to judicial review.
The role of the council is to develop policies based on peer reviewed evidence to be debated by the parliament and implemented by the executive.

Benefits? Self explanatory
- The prioritisation of metrics like Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, or social progress indices over GDP.
- The elimination of politics from problems like climate change, vaccination,  fire arm regulation, and social service provision (food safety, 
health care, education)

Challenges?
-Issues like history, identity, and culture could potentially take a back seat especially if they lack representation on the technocratic council.
-like any other system, the potential for anarchy in case the people feel that their voices are unheard.

My argument is that this is an objectively better system than a liberal democracy, and somewhat original enough for us to call it ours (the continent’s).

Africa,The trail of legacy in the life of a beauty queen 🇿🇦,"Shudufhadzo Musida, affectionately known as Shudu, was crowned Miss South Africa in 2020. She proudly hails from the province of Limpopo in South Africa, and making her the second titleholder from this region since the reign of Bokang Montjane. 

Limpopo is a South African province that is bordering Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It's known for bushveld and wildlife reserves, including part of Kruger National Park. West of the Kruger are the craggy **Blouberg mountains** and **Makgabeng Plateau** with ancient rock art. Near the provincial capital Polokwane, the **Arend Dieperink Museum** and fossil-rich caves of **Makapansgat** explore history dating back to early hominids. Limpopo is also home to to the renowned *Limpopo River*, which is the second largest African river that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the *Zambezi River*. The Limpopo River rises in South Africa and flows generally eastward through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean. The term Limpopo is derived from *Rivombo*, a group of *Tsonga* settlers led by *Hosi Rivombo* who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. 

The ancient **Kingdom of Mapungubwe** was a historic Iron Age settlement and kingdom located in what is now the Limpopo province of South Africa. It thrived between the 11th and 13th centuries CE, primarily because of its location at the confluence of the *Limpopo and Shashe Rivers*, which facilitated trade and access to resources. Mapungubwe's location at the junction of the *Limpopo and Shashe Rivers* was crucial for its prosperity. The river provided access to the coast and facilitated trade, and the surrounding savannah was suitable for cattle herding. The river's strategic location allowed Mapungubwe to participate in long-distance trade, exchanging local resources like ivory and gold for goods from the East African coast and beyond. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe thrived in part due to its access to resources and trade routes along the *Limpopo River*. It is believed to have declined in the late 13th century due to factors like resource depletion and shifts in trade patterns, with Great Zimbabwe later emerging as a major power in the region. Mapungubwe is considered one of the earliest examples of a centralised state in Southern Africa, and it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site contains numerous archaeological remains, including evidence of trade, settlements, and royal burials, providing insights into the history and culture of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe.  

The predominant ethnic groups that reside in the Limpopo Province are namely the Pedi people (***Bapedi)***, the Venda people (***VhaVenda***), and the Tsonga people (***Vatsonga***). The Venda people in particular are known as ""composite people"" due to the tapestry of a rich lineage that incorporates elements from various groups, including East African, Central African or even the fellow Southern African influences of Nguni and Sotho people. They believe that ancestors are active in their daily lives and communicate with them through rituals, oral storytelling and ceremonies. Some of the traditional practices would encompass traditional dances (like *tshikona* and *malende*), music, and drumming. The Venda language, ***Tshivenda***, is an official language of both South Africa and Zimbabwe. The Venda are believed to be related to the inhabitants of the ancient Kingdom of Mapungubwe. 

Remarkably, Shudufhadzo Musida is the first winner whose first language is Venda (***Tshivenda****)* and went on to represent South Africa at Miss World 2022, finishing in the top 40. The name Shudufhadzo means ""*we are blessed*"" or ""*to be blessed*"" in her mother tongue. Shudu made history as the first bald woman to win the Miss South Africa title - embracing her unique beauty. As a dedicated advocate for mental health awareness, an author, and a humanitarian, her passion lies mainly in empowering marginalised communities.

Shudu's academic journey began with a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Pretoria. She then earned an Honours degree in International Relations from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Currently, she is pursuing a Master of International Affairs at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) in New York, where she focuses on global development, human security, and policy innovation. Additionally, Shudu has been appointed as a Global Champion for Women and Girls by the UNFPA, advocating for universal access to sexual and reproductive health and mental health for women and girls. On the 9th of April 2025, she had the honour of moderating a high-level UN event on **Prioritising Sexual and Reproductive and Health and Rights (SRHR) and Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Crisis Response** at the United Nations headquarters. She continues to balance her academic ambitions and social activism. 

Her impactful work has garnered attention from prominent media outlets, including Vogue Italia, British Vogue, and Glamour South Africa, where she has had the grace of appearing on dual magazine covers. Furthermore, she is the author of *""Shudu Finds Her Magic,""* a best-selling children’s book that addresses bullying, as well as *""I Am Shudu: Finding My Voice, Knowing My Strength,""* which inspires young girls to celebrate their strengths.

Shudufhadzo Musida embodies a well-rounded and inspiring individual whose contributions to society reflect not only her beauty but also her commitment to making a meaningful difference. She is remembered for her poise, heritage, intelligence and charm. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kamtuf,,Unknown
Africa,"Do you guys believe that foreign companies can ethically extract natural resources (like mining, oil, etc.) in African countries? Or is it always exploitative?","I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this. In your opinion, can mining and other forms of natural resource extraction by foreign companies in your country ever be ethical and beneficial? Or do you feel it’s always exploitative, no matter what?

Could it be just a new form of neocolonialism with outside powers taking advantage of local people and resources? For example, in the DRC, we often hear about children working in dangerous conditions mining cobalt — a resource that's essential for things like electric car batteries and smartphones. Even though there’s huge international demand and profit, the local communities seem to suffer the most, while foreign companies and buyers benefit.

On the other hand, do you see any economic value or development opportunities when foreign investors come in to extract resources? Foreign investors tend to often have the capital and technical expertise needed to extract these materials, and most of the real economic value is added later during refining and manufacturing.

Would love to hear different perspectives! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1ka4kta/do_you_guys_believe_that_foreign_companies_can/,,Unknown

The bots finally caught up this week after major skeptism:

1. OneWorldNews on [View channel stats.](https://www.viewstats.com/@one.worldnews/videos) You will notice one thing: Almost all of the videos focus primarily on Ibrahim. In comparison, almost none of the articles on its website focus on him. The website say's the owners are from India, the YouTube channel says the US and so does the domain. Below are examples of articles/videos on YouTube channel vs website:

Renaldo’s extensive experience in retail management and business development has been instrumental in navigating the complexities of African commerce, from sourcing agricultural inputs to delivering premium dairy products and fresh produce.\* The website says that they are based in South Africa.

On the other hand, the YouTube channel does not seem related to the website but over the last month, 50 over their videos have focused primarily on Ibrahim and this is straight up dick-riding from symphathizing with the Kremlin to straight up comparing Traore with Chadwick Boseman. The channel says its based in the UK. The LinkedIn notes a founding date of 2024.

3. Other examples include [Capt. Ibrahim Traore a NEW president of United Africa, Africa and its Diaspora](https://youtu.be/Cqaruf7of4Y?si=PUMNjxExAEsfls9G)

4. Since the beginning of the year, this subreddit has seen a major asturfing campaign in line with this format. Glorify dictatorship, promote their advantages and make them a precursor to African progress. Examples include 

* [Western style democracy is not universal and should never be forced onto developing countries. 40+ upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1k9umz0/western_style_democracy_is_not_universal_and/),

You will notice under many of those posts, you will get comments like United Africa, Africa United etc. Many of the videos or posts by these purpoted news websites are not one critical of Traore.

If he was really pro-democracy, why isn't foreign media allowed in Burkina Faso, why is its diaspora protesting against him? Why have African's decided military dictatorships are now good. I'm Kenyan and while I was not born under the dictatorships of Moi and Kenyatta, the fear of that is what makes us wary of someone being too good to be true.

Africa,"To the African Mother Who Guilt-trips Her Child, Parenting is Your Job not a Bargaining Chip.","If you a parent, birthed a child, and went above and beyond to give them a good life, you haven't done any out of the blues something. You did your damn job!

Because, if you didn't raise the child produced from the intercourse you had, who did you expect to raise them?

So, coming to emotionally blackmail or gaslight your child with, 'after all you've done for them' so as to have your way is manipulative. Any parents who tows that path is wicked.

Yes! You are.

Why do you make it such a big deal when you are doing only but your job?
Did the child ask to be born?

You had sex, a child came out of it, and now you're acting like you carried the whole world on your head for doing what you're supposed to do. 

Nobody is saying parenting is not hard. It is. But stop guilt-tripping your children because you paid school fees or bought food. That’s your responsibility, not a favor.

You didn't do extra. You did what was expected.  
You brought a life into this world, and it's your duty to cater for that life, not use that as a weapon later on.

Some of you will say “After everything I’ve done for you, this is how you repay me?”  
Yes, because you're not supposed to 'OWN' your child’s life.  
You’re supposed to raise them, not control them.  

This mindset of entitlement is the reason many adults are broken today.  
They can’t make decisions freely because they're scared of ""disrespecting"" their parents.  
They can't chase their dreams without fear of guilt.

Let your children live. Let them breathe.  
Stop holding your sacrifice over their head like a debt they must pay for life.

Africa,Motswana lady walks us through the elegance of Southern African traditional attire 🇧🇼🇿🇦🇱🇸,"Tyra Molosi hails from Botswana as a beauty and lifestyle content creator, as well as the Chief Executive Officer of Sahara Scents. Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa with a landscape defined by the Kalahari Desert and the Okavango Delta, which becomes a lush animal habitat during the seasonal floods. The massive Central Kalahari Game Reserve, with its fossilised river valleys and undulating grasslands, is home to numerous animals including giraffes, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs. The predominant ethnic group in the country are Batswana - whom are also significantly found in the neighbouring country of South Africa. 

Batswana belong to the Sotho-Tswana ethnic branch comprising a large and diverse group of people, predominantly found in South Africa, Botswana, and Lesotho. They are considered a meta-ethnicity, meaning they are composed of several distinct groups with overlapping cultural and linguistic ties. There are a number of distinguishable dialects within each of the main Sotho-Tswana languages, but they remain largely mutually intelligible. The languages have a rich history and are closely tied to the cultural and social fabric of Southern Africa. The ethnicities are Batswana, Basotho and Bapedi whom speak the languages of Setswana, Sesotho and Sepedi. This connection can also be emphasised in other aspects such as the shared heritage of traditional attires. 

The dress worn in the pictures by Tyra is a traditional garment made from ***shweshwe*** fabric. She is commemorating the cultural pride of a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional Southern African clothing. Originally dyed indigo, the fabric is manufactured in a variety of colours and printing designs characterised by intricate geometric, and in this case, concentric circles and squares.

The local name *shweshwe* is derived from the fabric's association with Lesotho's **King Moshoeshoe I**, also spelled *""Moshweshwe""*. **Moshoeshoe I** is said to have been gifted with the fabric by French missionaries in the 1840s and subsequently popularised it. It is also known as ***sejeremane*** or ***seshoeshoe*** in Sotho as well as ***terantala*** (derived from Afrikaans ***tarentaal***). It's also important to note that in spite of it being a principal attire for Sotho-Tswana ethnicities, there are also other groups who had adopted the clothing in their own capacities. The fabric is known as ***ujamani*** in Xhosa culture (whom belong to the Nguni branch) after 19th century German and Swiss settlers who imported the *blaudruck -* meaning blueprint in German *-* fabric for their clothing and helped entrench it in Southern Africa. In Botswana, this traditional fabric is typically known as ***leteisi***. It is therefore interesting to observe the different contexts in which the fabric was introduced, and how it has evolved in distinct designs within the respective cultures. 

*Shweshwe* is traditionally used to make dresses, skirts, aprons and wraparound clothing. *Shweshwe* clothing is traditionally worn by newly married Xhosa women, known as *makoti,* and married Sotho women. Xhosa women have also incorporated the fabric into their traditional ochre-coloured blanket clothing. In Botswana, the fabric is also traditionally associated with brides and married women, but has recently moved into much wider popularity in casual settings. 

Aside from traditional wear, *shweshwe* is incorporated in contemporary Southern African fashion design for women and men from all ethnic groups, as well as for making accessories and upholstery.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7zv9z,,Unknown

Africa,The story of wheels and smoke 🇿🇦,"This is a motorsport culture called spinning - originating in the prominent township of Soweto in the 1980s. The quintessential car that is used to engage in the performance is the infamous BMW 325iS model, and what is locally acclaimed as ***gusheshe.*** It was one of the first BMWs to be assembled in South Africa, and thereafter making it a symbol of local automotive heritage. The car is honoured as a priceless luxury and referred to as a ""ghetto hero"" because of its popularity and association with the township culture. The term *gusheshe* essentially encompasses the car's overall cultural impact which represents an alignment of resilience, community, and a shared identity within the South African context. 

The history of car spinning - particularly its connection to gangsterism - is rooted in the sociopolitical landscape of South Africa. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was embraced as a flamboyant display that was often associated with stolen cars and commemoration of certain criminal activities. It was regularly performed as a funeral ritual in which a stolen car was spun around to honour the deceased in the black communities of South Africa, and mainly in Soweto. The motorsport emerged during the apartheid era and was therefore also used as a rebellious medium for marginalised groups to express frustration and dissent.

Over the years, it has evolved from a criminal act and transitioned into becoming a popular pastime that has been formalised as a legitimate and regulated sport with promoters such as Red Bull, talented performers, and cheerful spectators. **Red Bull** ***Shaya'iMoto*** is a massive spinning competition which was launched in 2019. The phrase ""shaya imoto"" is in the Zulu language and can be loosely translated as ""hit the brakes"" to allude to the anticipation of a car stunt. Spinning has culminated as an authentic performance art and cultural phenomenon throughout South Africa. 

Interesting fun fact is that spinning is also closely associated with the legendary ***Kwaito*** music. Kwaito is a South African music genre that was developed in the 90s by blending elements of house music and traditional South African rhythms. It is generally characterised by its fast-paced, often repetitive beats, heavy bassline, and lyrics frequently exploring the realities of township life. This is a genre that has also laid a foundation for subsequent music styles such as ***Amapiano***, and profusely celebrated for its timeless legacy. It plays a distinguishable role at sports events and symbolises the unique street culture in South African townships. The combination of the high-energy spinning activity with the music creates a special aesthetic and sensory experience. 

It is also important to note that spinning is not necessarily synonymous with what is conventionally known as drifting. Spinning and drifting, while both involve a loss of traction and sideways movement, are distinct techniques. The former emphasises controlled rotation and a complete turn in place, while the latter focuses on maintaining control and navigating a corner or turn while sliding sideways. Spinning is often associated with entertainment and stunts, whereas drifting is a motorsport governed by rules and formats. Spinning is uniquely South African.

Africa,African problems,"The main challenge with Africa isn’t that there aren’t resources or that Africans are some how inferior to other places or peoples:

It’s that African elites don’t see the need to invest in their people. They find it more profitable to extort and exploit citizens and live as second class citizens in other people’s capitals in Europe and America. 

Countries don’t develop because the people are special or they run into some huge sum of money. Countries develop when the political elites and economic elites to decide to extend their power for purposes that improve the quality of life for fellow citizens. This hasn’t happened in Africa in general, and worse off in non democracies.

So the question is not whether Africa should pursue a Chinese model or an American model. It about a political culture and institutional culture that forces both the economic and political class to see the benefit of investing in their respective countries, so that they would good for themselves in the process. The cost of underdevelopment should hurt them first. 

Economic models like state led, free enterprise, or mixed methods often lead to the same outcome without a change in the political culture of the society. 

We have a culture problem. And it’s not a culture of being less than as Africans, it’s a culture of exploitation, arrogance, and limited faith in ourselves or our people.

Africa,Why Are So Many Africans Always Fighting Village People?,"Any small thing that happens, village people. Any small wahala, it is spiritual.

Poverty is spiritual.  
Kidney disease is spiritual.  
Not getting married is spiritual.  
Exam failure is spiritual.  
Liver disease is from village people.  
HIV too? Village people.

How your village people infected you with HIV when you were the one that had five sex partners, raw, no protection, I don’t know. Did they follow you into the room? Or were they the ones pressing your phone when you ignored your test results?

At this point, you just have to ask: when will we, Africans stop blaming every other person but us for the poor choices we made? When will we begin to take responsibility and accountability for our choices?
 
You failed to submit your final year project on time, village people.  
You haven’t found a job, village people.  
Your child isn’t reading, village people.  


But can we pause and be honest for once?  
It is not your village people. It is you!

You didn’t study.  
You didn't take care of your health.  
You didn’t save money.  
You didn’t respect your body.  
You ignored signs.  
You skipped classes.  
You refused to plan.  
You kept postponing.  
You chose vibes over discipline.

But no, village people must collect.

This is not to say spiritual things do not exist. Of course, they do. But we have to stop using “village people” as a lazy excuse for everything. It is not only limiting, it is dangerous. It stops us from looking within, from growing, from learning.

This mindset exerts real effects on us in Africa, and there are consequences. Real consequences.

People delay seeking medical help because they are praying against spiritual arrows.
People stay in abusive situations thinking it’s a test of faith.
We do not learn from failure. We blame external forces.
We avoid therapy because we believe the problem is not mental, it’s spiritual.
We don’t hold ourselves aaccountable instead we spiritualize irresponsibility.
We demonize success so much that if someone succeeds, it must be jazz.
We hide behind religion while ignoring common sense and boundaries.
We mock logic and science, yet wonder why progress is slow.
We fear progress because we believe there's an invisible limit holding us back.

Let’s be honest with ourselves.

Every setback is not spiritual. Every failure is not from the village. Everything wrong with your life is not witchcraft.

Pro-Life people view abortion as the intentional ending of a human life (many say it's murder) even at the earliest stages of pregnancy. They say that just because the embryo isn’t fully developed doesn’t make it any less of a life. To them, killing an unborn child is no different from killing a born one since according to them, it’s still a person, just at a different stage of development.

There’s also a common belief among Pro-Life that many women push for legal abortion simply to avoid the consequences of sex: unplanned pregnancy. They see it as a way for people to escape responsibility. And honestly, I can understand that viewpoint to some extent based on what I’ve seen. 

Back when I was in high school, there were many girls in my class that were sexually active. I wasn’t because my parents are African and very strict and I valued my life too much to even try it. But many of the girls in my class didn’t come from strict households, plus didn’t take their education seriously. Men were mostly their priority and focus so they were much more free in that sense. 

There was one girl in particular, I didn’t know her personally but we had a mutual friend. She was part of the group of girls at school who were sexually active. My friend, who knew her well, would sometimes gossip about her to me and once told me that the girl had said “If I’m pregnant, I’ll just get an abortion.” And in the end, that’s exactly what happened. She disappeared from school for many months and I found out through that same friend she had gotten an abortion.

Now, seeing how normalized abortion has become in America especially among people in my generation, it really brought that memory to me in the present. It made me realize how quickly people my age tend to turn to abortion, with no hesitation, no emotion, it’s a quick decision for them like it’s nothing. It’s casual for them as getting out an appendix out. Abortion doesn’t feel like a moral dilemma anymore and many people actually encourage abortion even despite the women having unprotected sex with her own free will. 

On the other side of things, with Pro-Choice, there are people who believe abortion should remain legal and accessible and should be no reason to make the woman a slave by undermining her right to her own body. And that forcing a woman to have a child even though she doesn’t want it (and in some cases rape) can cause the baby to be born in a undesirable life of poverty, neglect, and instability. The mother may also feel deep resentment towards the baby since the child serves as a reminder of her actions. 

The baby could also virtually destroy the life of the mother because she won’t be able to go to college. She may have to drop out of school to get a job in order to provide for the child which could finically make the life harder for the mother and her family. 

So this begs the question: Should life be born even if they’re going to grow up in an unwanted sub-par living conditions that not even convicted criminals would want have to be born at all? Should life be forced upon women even if it’s cold, harsh, and unforgiving? Would you personally allow your kids to get one if she got pregnant young or from a situation like rape?

I’m not here to start a debate, just genuinely interested in hearing your personal thoughts on abortion. Growing up in the West, it’s easy to get influenced by the dominant narratives here so I’d really like to hear how older Africans especially those living on the continent see this issue. 

I’ve heard that in many African countries abortion is illegal or highly stigmatized but I also know opinions can vary based on religion, education and personal experience so not everyone is a monolith ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1k43ie9/what_do_africans_living_in_africa_think_about/,,Unknown
Africa,That world happiness survey is complete crap,"I usually do not do this, as this does not directly talk about the continent. But there too many people stupid enough to think the index is actually objective instead of a contradicting Western handjob. You cannot index happiness without making cultural assumption.

Africa,Tunisia : immigrants and tunsian coflict : a point of view of a simple citizen,"Hi guys i hope you re doing great , im sorry i cant share my real name for my protection and after you read this post u ll understand why .

What do you need to know is im a law graduatw currently finishing my masters degree in tunisia and so intrested im politics news 

I saw a video today of two young immigrants who got beaten by tunisian citizens which was so horrific and i felt sorry not only for them but also for the situation my country got after this fked up administration of the current president thats why i felt i need to write this post to explain my point of view to the african community and why not giving a part of the truth to you guys 

After the president took over the authority and took down the parliment order in 2021 i noticed our relation with our african nations is getting worst each year especially after him speaking publicly about some imaginary conspiracy of "" changing the demographic system od tunisia"" which putted us as a tunisian people who once were the sysmbol of democracy and culture now as a racist offendors 

Dont get me wrong im not trying to justify the action on the immigrants offenders i truly believe they need to be punished also cuz what theh did is a crime in our law , however due to this joke administration the agression rate towards immigrants keeps getting high and high everyday and let me try to tell you why from my humble prespective 

Imagine your ""leader"" keeps telling you everyday and on every single occation that there is some sort of schemes and attacks against our social security besides from the other not trying to find solution for the immigrants here who are stuck with us in this failed regime knowingly he took money from the EU to keep the in tunisia so logically he needs to organize their residency in here to avoid conflicts with locals and keep their dignity as human being , sadly what i talked about still not even on the disussion table because the administration still playing the easiest card to avoid its responsibilities which is the victim card and always trying to blame its faillures on the conspirances and sometimes on the poor immigrants themselves 

I wanted to say a big part of the tunisian people are against this policies and incase we try to protest we will be accused of treason ( thats why i want to hide my identity ) , but to our african brothers/sisters i want to say tunisia is not racist , it misguied by an insane president and people are afraid thats why we see those actions ( yes from a narrow scale there is racism like anyother place even between locals me as southern man would be discriminated in multiple occations but thats doesnt necessarily mean all people are racisit )  , just patience like we do here as locals cuz we are in this sht together we also as citizens not being able to access effciently to simple govermentale services such as police services ..etc 

We still have hope guys and everything wil be okay over time we as tunisians proved multiple times we overcome dictatorships and thats what we are going to do one more time to create a good living for all of us

Africa,Ghana orders foreigners to exit gold market by April 30,"Ghana has ordered foreigners to exit its gold trading market by the end of the month, a new government body said on Monday, as the West African country looks to streamline gold purchases from small-scale miners, increase earnings and reduce smuggling.

Africa's leading gold producer is shifting away from a system in which local and foreign companies with export licenses can buy and export gold from artisanal or small-scale mining.

Under the new system, the newly created gold board known as GoldBod is the only entity allowed to buy, sell, assay and export artisanal gold, Monday's statement said, and older licences have ceased to be valid.

Foreigners must leave the local gold trading market by April 30 although they can apply ""to buy or take off gold directly from the GoldBod,"" the statement said.

Finance minister Cassiel Ato Forson said in January that the creation of GoldBod would allow Ghana to benefit more from gold sales while maintaining the national currency's stability.

Ghana's gold exports grew by 53.2% in 2024 to $11.64 billion, of which nearly $5 billion was from legal small-scale miners.

Gold prices vaulted on Friday over the $3,200-per ounce mark for the first time.

The trade war between the United States and China has rattled global markets and driven investors into gold, which is traditionally viewed as a hedge against geopolitical and economic uncertainty.",https://eastleighvoice.co.ke/west%20african/138398/ghana-orders-foreigners-to-exit-gold-market-by-april-30,,Unknown
Africa,Unending Frustration Regarding Sudan War.,"https://www.reuters.com/world/britain-boosts-aid-victims-sudan-conflict-conference-2025-04-14/

So the UK and EU just launched a new campaign to send million upon millions of dollars to Sudan (>120M notes). Not only does this raise huge questions for me about their intentions but it highlights the absolute insanity of this pointless conflict. 

1. It has been repeatedly shown that he RSF steals aid. If they are allowing aid in now, how did the UK accomplish this monumental feet...also why was is not all over the news? Also, why can't they just do this for the whole war! Like if they made negotiations with her RSF to lay off so they could deliver aid......why not do that same thing and END THE WAR? If they armed themselves and sent guys in? How did they manage to passify warring solders and why not passify ALL OF THEM? if we got in and out peacefully there has to be something to the magic we can use to fight the RSF? 

2. How do we know he RSF won't just take the Aid as they have done for 2 years? For months and months this has been an impossibly to send aid and suddenly we can bus in millions of notes in aid? The vast majority of last year the US was trying to send 3 trucks of aid and basically failed. You get me? 

3. Why hasn't the US or UK investigated the UAE when there have been several limes of very clear evidence from reputable sources hat he UAE is funding the RSF? Why not put millions into a formal investigation to where we can charge the UAE for war crimes thus ending the war. I think that's considerably more effective then pouring MONEY on a fire hoping it goes out soon?? Yet there is 0 mention of the UAE despite the US and EU having numerous talks with UAE leaders regarding Sudan in the recent past? On top of that, the UK DIDNT INVITE the Sudanese government to a peace talk regarding Sudan. In what way shape or form does that make any sense? 

4. The UAE and UK are close allies and 78% of the Gold leaving Sudan is going to the UAE. 

Like it's just insanity after insanity! I asked ChatGPT these same line of questions and this is he response it gave:

Africa,Tanzania's Authoritarian Government Has Just Banned Its Main Opposition Party From October Elections,"Tanzania's main opposition party has been barred from participating in this year's election, days after its leader was charged with treason.

The director of elections at the Independent National Elections Commission, said that Chadema had failed to sign a code of conduct document that was due on Saturday, meaning the party was disqualified from October's elections.

Last week, Chadema's leader Tundu Lissu was [arrested and charged with treason](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98gg7172ymo) following a rally in southern Tanzania at which he called for electoral reforms.

The CCM party, which has governed Tanzania in a grip since 1977 has been responsible for brutal torture, abductions, and killing opposition leaders. This is the first contested election since Vice-president Samia Suluhu ascended to president after the death of John P. Magufuli in 2021. Suluhu had earlier on rolled back some of the oppressive actions of Magufuli in what was seen as a promise towards more electoral reforms. Since then the government has regressed to targeting opposition as elections approach.

Dozens of opposition leaders and activists, including Lissu, were either arrested or assaulted by the police last year. Several prominent Chadema activists were murdered. Lissu had returned in 2023 from exile after surviving being shot 16 times in a 2017 attempted assassination.

Now they've banned their main opponent after calls for electoral reforms.
