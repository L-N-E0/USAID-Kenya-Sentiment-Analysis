Kenya,donors,Dear Gentle Readers,"Good morning my gentle readers

Today I have a question to this men, why are you so tied up with your friends that you prioritise them over your families ama it's just baba without manners? 

Anyway Reason number 4 on why I will never forgive baba without manners: his unhealthy attachment with his boys. 

This particular friends have been a thorn in my life and I just blame baba without manners (I will save his number like this😂😂). 
Anyway let me take you back to the end of my second trimester heading to the third, that's when we moved in together.  

How do you people house hunt when searching for a house that utaishi na spouse wako? Si mnaenda pamoja ama? And weigh the options right? 

Aaah, baba with funds went with his friends looking for a house that we are supposed to live in. I tell him, na si uende na mimi juu unaenda kuishi na mimi😐😐. It fell on deaf ears. Anyway, he goes with them looking through different houses and the only thing I get is videos and reasons why he doesn't wanna live in the area. 

He finds the house we are currently living in, and kwanza it is on the 5th floor and this building has no lift. By then I was very heavily pregnant and such a distance would have been a great inconvenience. Anyway, baba without manners commits all of that and just sends the video. I see it's a nice house and tells me, ameshalipia. 

By then, I had moved out of my sweet house🤣🤣the house i was very happy in and experienced so much growth. Aaah, baba without manners wewe🙄🙄🙄. So, he moves everything in and comes for my clothes. And tells me, he will come pick me up kesho yake. True to his word, he did come lakini hio heaviness kwa roho yangu jamani. And shockingly, nilipanda stairs mpaka fifth floor and I was out of my breath. 

But moving into that house became a thorn into my life, each weekend baba without manners forces me to go home because he wants to host his friends. At first I get mad, and walk out naenda home. One weekend I refused to go home, I told him, kwani nyi wanaume wote wasita hamuezi kakomboa air bnb mkae huko🙄🙄

Gentle readers, ni kama niliguza nyuki, he started ranting, he said venye, I do Everything for you, na we kunipea tu privacy kwa nyumba yangu ata huezi. Enda kwenu nitakukujia tuende kanisa on sunday🫥. Mimi nikasema siendi, Aaah, aliongea matope wadau hata skuamini. He left, akaenda shugli zake and came back the following day mchana claiming ametoka ulevi hata sikuuliza. 

I asked him one day, si hata unipeleke just kwa park nikaone wanyama basi. ( nikiwa mdogo sijai enda hizo school trips because apparently my shosho didn't see the need to pay for me to go see wild animals). He told me he will ask his friends they plan for it. Aaah, curse those men, walikataa wakasema huko wameenda mara mingi. Anyway, the only place baba with manners takes mi ni kanisa na kwao na kwetu sometimes. Smh. 

Nothing can be done juu lazima hio committee iamue mambo ya kwangu. Anyway, one of his friends has a wife that decided she wants to be happy. Now, they all call her a hoe just because hangojei bwana yake to do things with her. Baba without manners is now projecting that on me. He says venye akiwai nipata nikikunywa tutakosana vibaya sana. 😂😂😂. 

Now, that is really affecting my freedom, juu, lets say I go even to town, aaah baba without manners will keep calling me after every 20 minutes aniambie niende home. Kwanza saa hii with our baby is worse. He will tell me, rudi home uangalie mtoto as if I do not know that. 

Let's go to today's incident. Nimemwambia I will leave for an hour or two, my mum is coming to town na anahitaji my help. Eeei gentle readers, ashaanza kuniuliza for how long nakaa huko. I told him mimi sijui, si he left akaenda. Now as we speak, alishapiga simu kuniambia venye whatever i am going to do in town sio important at all. I should be very fast and go back home juu hio sio emergency. 

For  context, my mum kuna siku amehitaji blood donors and baba without manners did not he gave a flimsy excuse. I couldn't donate because I am breastfeeding and pia I gave birth through CS so singekubalishwa. My mum alikua admitted close to 3 weeks and hakuai bother kuenda hata kumuona and she asked for him. He said atamuonea nyumbani, two months later he has never even asked kama ako sawa. 
Aaah, baba without manners ananichukia mimi na familia yangu yote🤣🤣🤣. 
Kwanza now that i am dependent on him, he is enjoying every bit of my misery. Hata akinituma supper, of which money is calculated so he will inspect kama nimenunua what he says, he will keep calling me to make sure I am back kwa nyumba by 6pm. Claiming hataki giza inipate nje, but surely, ulinipata nikiishi pekee yangu😅😅😅 hio supper ata saa tatu ya usiku nlikua naendea. 

So men, what the hell do you rely on yiur mbogis for? 

Till later gentle readers, 
Have a fantastic day as you grind. ",2025-05-30,61,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1kyxebr/dear_gentle_readers/

People might say the wazungu just go to and showcase the bad areas but fail to question why we have those dilapidated areas. Accountability from our leaders in these areas is so lacking while ukienda huko unaoneshwa mansions za governors, mps, and former chancellors or whatever they were before the new constitution.  A youtuber does more for a community than what the administration does with funding, taxes, and loans. Make it make sense. Anyway, i appreciate all the efforts beast philanthropy, JerryRigEverything, among others are doing.

Kenya,USAID,Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business.",2025-04-07,167,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/

Kenya,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",2025-04-01,122,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Kenya,"USAID, USAID money",Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

Kenya,USAID,The Israel-Gaza War: A Symptom of a Looming Global Showdown,"At first glance, BRICS, the rise of the AfD, Trump, USAID, China, the Russo-Ukraine war, and the surge of right-wing politics in Europe seem unrelated to the conflict in Israel. However, they are all pieces of a larger geopolitical struggle—one that signals a growing divide between the Global North and the rising Global South.

For decades, Western powers dominated global affairs, leveraging economic sanctions, military interventions, and financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to maintain control. But this order is being challenged. The first major warning came with the Russia-Ukraine war. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions, expecting Russia’s economy to collapse. Instead, Russia pivoted to the Global South, deepening trade ties with China, India, and other BRICS nations. Not only did Russia’s economy remain stable, but it also continued producing advanced weaponry without Western technology—something previously thought impossible.

Then came October 7, 2023. Israel, the West’s key ally in the Middle East, was attacked in an unprecedented assault that exposed severe weaknesses in its security apparatus. Israel’s much-vaunted military—long perceived as invincible—was caught off guard and humiliated. This was a serious blow, not just to Israel but to Western hegemony itself. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 had already shattered the myth of Western military invulnerability. The Russian invasion of Ukraine further demonstrated that Western deterrence was weakening. If Israel—a nuclear-armed state backed by the U.S.—could be so easily struck, what message would that send to the rest of the world?

Western powers needed to respond forcefully, not just to defend Israel, but to reassert their dominance. Their message is clear: We will arm Israel no matter what. We will support them regardless of civilian casualties. And we will broadcast the destruction of Gaza for all to see—so you understand that resistance is futile.

This is not just about Israel or Palestine. It’s about power. The Global North is watching as the Global South—led by China and supported by Russia—grows economically and demographically. BRICS is expanding, challenging the U.S.-led financial order. Right-wing populism is surging in Europe as economic strains push Western nations inward. The U.S. is increasingly relying on military-industrial alliances and foreign interventions to maintain its grip on global affairs.

The Israel-Gaza conflict is a symptom of this broader struggle. It is a power play—a brutal display meant to reinforce the notion that, despite its decline, the Western order will not relinquish control without a fight. But the cracks are showing, and history suggests that no empire, no matter how dominant, can hold back change forever",2025-02-26,2,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1iygomq/the_israelgaza_war_a_symptom_of_a_looming_global/

Kenya,"USAID, NGOs","Finally, it's gets deeper. I lost my job","With the recent USAID cuts, I knew we  might get here but didn't know how fast it would be. 

A little background, I have worked in NGOs for a few years now and I've realized once you start in one NGO you can easily hop to another one as long as you understand what you need to say during interviews and how to do your work.

 I recently started a consultancy with one of these big NGOs that deal with refugees. My first contract was ending on 31st Jan and I got an email today (basically due to lack of funding I've been let go). 

I know most of these NGOs dealing with refugees rely on BHA funding which comes from USAID and with that gone, most people have and will loose their jobs. DRC, Impact Initiatives,WHO, IOM are among the organisations that I know have started letting go of their employees. These are just unfortunate and very uncertain times.

Anyway, my thoughts are all over but it's funny how I'm not even stressed because I have no control over the situation. Currently seated with my mum and I've not told her the news yet. Planning to keep it to myself for sometime.

Kenya,USAID,"USAID left a month ago, do we have ARVs in Kenya?","Someone on a different group (different website) was asking if now that USAID is gone, does kenya still have ARV medications? Like can people go for PEP? or those who are infected are they still getting their meds???

  
If not then we are about to enter an epidemic, where people infected start infecting others at a higher rate. Since for many people, when taking the medications they were less risk of infecting others.",2025-04-15,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jzrn2s/usaid_left_a_month_ago_do_we_have_arvs_in_kenya/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jzrn2s/usaid_left_a_month_ago_do_we_have_arvs_in_kenya/
Kenya,USAID,Classism in r/Kenya and r/nairobi,"The classism I'm seeing in both subs is a good example of some of the current society. Honestly, it is sickening. A week does not pass before seeing some classist posts by a few people. The sad part about this classism is that most of these people are not rich rich. If they got sick, they would probably end up in debt or selling their stuff, ama watengeneze posters za M-Changa. An observation I have made is that most people here are middle class, kids from middle-class families na watu wameshika pesa juzi juzi. Most people here ni wale hawajapitia ile season you lack things or life is not going well. Fair enough because most people here are employed so they have job security.

The other day, we had some guy talking about cheap perfumes and how they irritate him, as if everyone can afford designer perfumes. Mindless rumblings about matatus sijui ziko na nini, someone else was going on about makangas yet when Super Metro was suspended, everyone was suddenly an expert on public transport supporting collective punishment. Wewe kama matatu zimekushinda nunua gari yako. Can we talk about some of the silly rules wengine wenyu mko nazo, rules tu za ujinga that show how hii illusion ya pesa kidogo has consumed most of you people. Yani small small moneys have most of you guys shitting on others. Sasa umepata pesa juzi juzi unaona unaeza ambia watu by a certain age wanafaa kua na certain achievements. Yani mnadharau mtu juu anasema KFC ni watu wako na pesa. Now all of sudden you have money, umesave 200k youthink other people are lazy, mnaanza kuignore your struggling friends wakipiga simu mkiwawekea rules mpaka za kuwapigia or visit. This is not normal.

In my line of consultancy work, I've met very influential people, rich men and women with big cars and thousands of acres of land. The common factor in most of them was their humility. I encounter classism every day on X but ya reddit imeanza kua worse, borderline narcissistic ata. I never expected to see it among a redditors who claim to be better than people who use other social media apps, which is funny juu hakuna difference kubwa between watu wako huku na X, or even Facebook or Tiktok. Most of you guys need to learn that Kenya is a poor country. Don't let living in a 20k or 50k apartment make you arrogant. The classism here ata mgeni akikuja atafikiria Kenya is a MEDC where almost everyone is rich with a high income. The reality ni most of you mko a disease away from poverty, even if you have insurance. Pesa huisha, life changes. On LinkedIn, I saw a video of a woman who was affected na USAID cuts, akisema vile she felt lost and how she was adjusting to life. That is the reality for most of you, especially na hii economy ya kasongo. In 2022, I was averaging 250k per month before I closed my business. The next thing I knew, my world was falling apart saizo niko na bank loan ya kumaliza. Life humbles you outlook yako ya life inabadilika sana.

I have a friend wako na 90 acres Limuru na majani chai na vegetables, and this guy got an internship kusaidia watu Mathare, and his outlook in life changed completely. This is a guy from an influential family, a respected medical doctor and professor, successful by their own right. We are talking about mtu alipata cancer, akaenda majuu, stayed there and finished her treatment na akarudi Kenya, and the family did not go broke. Most of you need a similar experience muache kuona watu wengine kama sio watu because they are not doing enough before your eyes. Being classist and you do not own any significant capital or other factors of production is crazy business.",2025-04-07,167,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jtcvbx/classism_in_rkenya_and_rnairobi/

Kenya,"USAID, USAID money",Why western powers back Israel no matter what and Kenya should avoid being a useful idiot,"I don't care what good book you read, but it's clear that Israel is a settler colonial state, The Bible is not a land deed ,never has been and never will be but this post is not about Israel anyway rather it's about what Israel represents and why the West is backing Israel to the hilt but for that we have to go back to 2020 during the COVID crisis.

In 2019 there was a report done that showed that the US and the UK are the two countries that are best prepared for a global pandemic. That was just a theoretical study that was soon put to the test and it showed how horrible these countries were in times of a pandemic, the US led in deaths at over 1.2 million and the UK, despite having a small population came in sixth with about 220 k deaths. Forget the Hollywood movies whereby an American scientist saves the world, this was real life and in real life, Russia developed the first vaccine and took a jab at the Americans calling it Sputnik V. The Russians were rekindling an old wound and reminding the Americans that just like many decades ago they had been the first in Space.

Come 2021 and there was the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan was another blow to the American psyche, as the Americans fled, Taliban gunmen with their sandles and often just armed with their AK-47s followed,  it was quite a picture, this was the most powerful country in the world and it had just lost to a bunch of simple farmers ,it must have rekindled memories of Vietnam where the Americans had fled in a similar manner almost 50 years ago.

Then came February 2022 and Putin sent his armies across the Ukrainian frontier ,now this necessitated a reaction ,the western world needed to remind the world who's boss and so they did try. They imposed some of the worst sanctions on Russia and expected economic collapse in short order but alas, it never came. China and India threw their weight behind Russia and this has been enough to counterbalance the sanctions, the Russians even started getting weapons from countries like Iran ,and these weapons were not some innefective toys, they were terrifyingly effective. When the economic front wasn't working they began sending weapons ,offensive weapons and they seemed to have believed their own propaganda which is basically : Any non-western technology = bad, western technology = good. But their wonder weapons were laid to waste and brought back to Russia, another humiliation. But more was to come.

On Oct 7th 2023 at dawn Hamas fighters launched one of the greatest attacks ever on Israel, Israeli divisions in the South disintegrated in the face of this attack and Israel was utterly humiliated, they had just been humiliated by people they had kept under a 17 year blockade and surveilled every section of the border, their high walls and tech just disappeared and was laid to waste. Images of Israeli soldiers crawling and being dragged out of their tanks scattered all over the Internet. This was a bridge too far and Israel and more importantly it's backers i.e the west felt that something had to be done , these people had to be shown who's boss. And so they wrote Israel a blank cheque to do whatever it wants ,Gaza was where they would reinstate their position and Gaza was to pay for all the humiliation of the last 3 years.

A few weeks ago, there was a conference of antisemitism in Europe, that conference was attended by all sorts of parties in Europe, almost all right wing and many zionist jews refused to attend after seeing these parties were attending. They have caught on that they are in bed with snakes, these parties aren't attending because of genuine concern for any jews ,they are allying with Israel because their supporters just like seeing dead arabs and Muslims i.e they are racist. Even the Republican party in America suffers from this phenomenon too. On one hand these parties blame the jews for the uncontrolled immigration,degeneracy and decline in family values in the west and on the other hand they claim to fully support Israel. These people only love the jews when they're killing Arabs which fulfills their racist desires. It's their useful idiot in the middle East.

Kenya and particularly Kenyans should avoid being useful idiots, I've noticed Kenyans like to parrot right wing talking points particularly those that touch on christianity, a Kenyan who's children are probably vaccinated on USAID money will say Trump is great because he is anti-LGBTQ.  You'll find the average Kenyan calling Houthis terrorists and even supporting the construction of a drone base in Kenya to strike the Houthis  ,Houthis that have never in any way shape or form attacked Kenya. Btw this useful Idiocy is what brought Al Shabaab to our borders,  Ethiopia ,another useful Idiot was used by the US to invade Somalia and topple the Islamic courts union (ICU) government, not because the ICU posed any danger to the US but because the Americans claimed that the ICU may one day become like the Taliban and now here we are. Who knows maybe 40 yeard from now the CIA will declassify a memo that showed that the US just wanted to test whether 3rd world countries would be an excellent substitute for American and NATO forces in the war on terror. In other words we are stuck with Al Shabaab because the US wanted to conduct an academic study.

Trump is the same man who called African countries shithole countries, and is currently trying to end USAID. Correct me if I'm wrong, but does Homa Bay not have the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya. Shouldn't he want organizations like USAID to keep on working in healthcare, since they supply ARVs and other stuff for cheaper rates than if we went out there and bought them ourselves.

Kenya,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Foreign aid/Philanthropy,"I see the aid or philanthropic activities that are done by youtubers and can't help but wonder what has the government done in our 60 years of self governance. People might say the wazungu just go to and showcase the bad areas but fail to question why we have those dilapidated areas. Accountability from our leaders in these areas is so lacking while ukienda huko unaoneshwa mansions za governors, mps, and former chancellors or whatever they were before the new constitution.  A youtuber does more for a community than what the administration does with funding, taxes, and loans. Make it make sense.

Kenya,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Kibaki ALSO failed us,"
There is a tendency to over-exaggerate the presidency and persona of Mwai Kibaki. Some of the notable achievements attributed to him were not necessarily driven by his vision but were consequences of the 2007/2008 post-election violence (PEV), such as devolution, an inclusive government, and a rare moment of effective checks and balances.

Before 2007, Kibaki oversaw a revived economy, but it is important to contextualize this growth. Kenya’s economy had been in decline under Moi, with GDP growth hitting a low of -0.3% in 2000. When Kibaki took over in 2003, GDP growth rebounded to 2.9%, then surged to 5.1% in 2004 and peaked at 7.1% in 2007. While his administration implemented economic reforms, it also benefited from a massive inflow of foreign aid and increased remittances from the diaspora, which rose from $338 million in 2004 to over $1.6 billion by 2012.

Politically, however, Kibaki undermined much of the economic and institutional progress Kenya had made after the Moi era. He entrenched ethnic politics, refused to relinquish power after losing a widely disputed election, and oversaw a crisis that led to the deaths of over 1,100 Kenyans and the displacement of more than 600,000 people. His administration also became synonymous with some of Kenya’s worst corruption scandals, including the Anglo Leasing scandal, which cost taxpayers an estimated Ksh 56 billion.

Kibaki was no saint, and some of the praise he receives today borders on historical revisionism.",2025-04-01,120,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/,https://reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1jojl2f/kibaki_also_failed_us/

Nairobi,USAID,Theres always someone out there worse off than you.,"I was talking to my South Sudanese friend yesterday,when he asked me if there were any job opportunities I could refer him to.He said that he's been unemployed since the massive turnoff of USAID jobs.

I'm like why cant he look for another job. He told me that getting a job in Kenya,you first need to process a work permit and that's 20k and plus he used to work in Class D,so that's 500k extra.He was like he couldn't afford that. So I told him to begin at home-like what about his home country.

And he said that was even worse. Unless you're a Dinka in South Sudan you're ot getting a job(think of them like Kikuyus in Kenya).He said that even scholarships aren't spared,the best scholarships go to the Dinkas.I thought that he was a tribalist until I later on saw that it was [true.Now](http://true.Now) in South Sudan,they aren't like in Kenya,In Kenya,companies are actually obliged to employ kenyans first before foreigners.I think a guy mentioned it in the sub a few hours ago...

In South Sudan, it's actually the opposite-they actually employ people who aren't South Sudanese-like if you're a Ugandan,youre more likely to get a job opportunity there and so on...(again other than if you're a Dinka).I mean this guys are corrupt(but not more corrupt than KASONGO,lol)

And on top of that South Sudan's employment rate is 12,49 compared to Kenya's at 5.7%.They also have-and this actually shocked me.Wueeh only 5.1% of people there have access to electricity.And also south Sudan has the least literacy rates in the WORLD at 34.52%.

I know Kasongo aliharibu hii nchi lakini damn,not to be respectful,you cant pay me enough money to live in South Sudan(no disrespect to South Sudanese-I actually love yall).

Nairobi,aid withdrawal,What steps are you taking to keep your business profitable.,"Let's face it, since last year August; a lot of businesses have been struggling to stay afloat in Kenya coupled with Trump's aid withdrawal which i am sure is affecting many NGO's. What are you doing to keep your business profitable?",2025-04-14,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jyv2tj/what_steps_are_you_taking_to_keep_your_business/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1jyv2tj/what_steps_are_you_taking_to_keep_your_business/
Nairobi,"USAID, USAID money, donors, NGOs",My experience with the USAID Money.,"The list of companies who've been getting money from USAID is out and looking at it, I'm questioning whether we needed USAID in the first place. Sometimes back, a childhood friend who runs an NGO at the Coast called me that he'd be attending a USAID Conference at a location in Nairobi's Blue zone. The following day (Monday), I passed by the hotel to say hi at around Lunch hour. To gain access, I had to write my name and a few details at the entrance of the conference facility. Later that day i received around $130 from USAID. I continued receiving different amounts from USAID every evening until Friday that week. In total, I think I received around $600. I called him on Friday evening, told him of the amounts I had been receiving from the conference. He asked me to take half and send him half but I told him I'll just take one fuel tank $190 and send him the rest, which I did.
 
This experience reminded me of two stories. 
1. A lady that I highly respect (she's in this sub and has experience with grants and fundraising) once told me about the NGO world and that the main objective of most of the NGO's in Kenya is to swindle donor funds. I didn't take her seriously but now looking at the list of the organizations that have been collecting millions from USAID, with minimal to zero impact, I now agree with her. She was right. 

2. I once had a fling who was a CEC-M in one of the counties in Kenya. She used to be passionate about the need for NGO regulation and holding NGO's accountable for every penny they receive from donors to ensure that such funds are properly utilized to impact the targeted population. I didn't take her seriously and thought that maybe as a government official in her county, she just jealous that she had no cut in NGOs money. She was however speaking from a point of knowledge - Her mother, an NGO director was out earning her father who was an accomplished Professor and a researcher (Do you know how much you need to make to outearn a reputable researcher?)- Looking at the USAID list, now she's making sense to me than ever. 

Note:
1. I sympathize with the thousands of families who are going to be affected by the loss of livelihoods from USAID's exit.. 
2. I also sympathize with the millions of families whose unfortunate flights are used by NGO's to secure funding only for such funds to be redirected to the Director's private exploits. 
3. I advocate for working systems where all entities can be held accountable and more do where the Government can be diligent and efficient to an extent where we achieve self reliance and therefore don't rely on donor funds in the first place.

Nairobi,USAID,Theres always someone out there worse off than you.,"I was talking to my South Sudanese friend yesterday,when he asked me if there were any job opportunities I could refer him to.He said that he's been unemployed since the massive turnoff of USAID jobs.

I'm like why cant he look for another job. He told me that getting a job in Kenya,you first need to process a work permit and that's 20k and plus he used to work in Class D,so that's 500k extra.He was like he couldn't afford that. So I told him to begin at home-like what about his home country.

And he said that was even worse. Unless you're a Dinka in South Sudan you're ot getting a job(think of them like Kikuyus in Kenya).He said that even scholarships aren't spared,the best scholarships go to the Dinkas.I thought that he was a tribalist until I later on saw that it was [true.Now](http://true.Now) in South Sudan,they aren't like in Kenya,In Kenya,companies are actually obliged to employ kenyans first before foreigners.I think a guy mentioned it in the sub a few hours ago...

In South Sudan, it's actually the opposite-they actually employ people who aren't South Sudanese-like if you're a Ugandan,youre more likely to get a job opportunity there and so on...(again other than if you're a Dinka).I mean this guys are corrupt(but not more corrupt than KASONGO,lol)

And on top of that South Sudan's employment rate is 12,49 compared to Kenya's at 5.7%.They also have-and this actually shocked me.Wueeh only 5.1% of people there have access to electricity.And also south Sudan has the least literacy rates in the WORLD at 34.52%.

I know Kasongo aliharibu hii nchi lakini damn,not to be respectful,you cant pay me enough money to live in South Sudan(no disrespect to South Sudanese-I actually love yall).

Any South Sudanese in this sub,is any of this true?",2025-05-12,83,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1kl7bcm/theres_always_someone_out_there_worse_off_than_you/,https://reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1kl7bcm/theres_always_someone_out_there_worse_off_than_you/

Nairobi,USAID,Karibu na mzuri! A day in the life of a job seeker.,"Karibu na mzuri! A day in the life of a job seeker.

Sijui  niite bahati ama kuponea chupu chupu. Nimeitiwa hustle flani nikiwa hapo CBD , nayo mimi afisa mtiifu wa Generali Shillingi ya Kenya nikareport post . post ilikua hapo kamukunji.  I was given a days contract as clerk wa kudistribute  ""jst arrived"" USAID relief food , in my mind I was like this is God , I arrived in town that morning for an interview ya izi mboka za gulf .Anyways kijana nimepiga m&s zangu  za pale T2 safi , navy blue pants n a white shirt, chini  nimefunga hesabu na dark brown boots , Clarks flani I scored gikomba na bei ya Sunday (btw Sunday bei NI ya -wananchi-) .

Alright post pleasantries tume exchange na mama Mikey, ( shes the one who called me in )  nikaonyeshwa desk na mine forms pale tayari , lakini si mnajua Tu mambo ya hii serikali msongo, relief food kwa TV walishapiga picha za exchange handshake, lakini kwa ground Lori ya mikate ndo imefika pekee sasa NI tutegee Lori ya unga na mafuta iko hapo' Uhuru highway'.  

20mins wait ishageuka 3 hrs , ata wenye walikua wamekujia hio aid ikabidi warudi home na hustle kidogo afu wakam mabadae, Mimi nilitoka kwetu malaa 5:30 morning ndo nimake interview ya 8:00 anniversary towers, so pale kwa desk ya mine nishaanza kudrool , si fault yangu men, Kiti ilikua billionaire barn mesh , very comfortable thing ,miguu pale juu ya acquisition form za wenyewe,nikua Nishaanza kuota vile sasa hao clients na investors WA Kai and Karo wamehamia sasa kwa kampuni ya mine long story short niliamshwa na sauti ya glass wall ikimwagika, lakini vile hio sauti ilikua karibu I dared not open my eyes Mimi NI mgonjwa wa macho am keen to protect my eyes more than am eager to see whats happening.

I could feel pieces of glass trickle down my body as if I did sweat silica ,turns out Mike my bosses son was skating around his mom's empty office before he went through the glass wall, I was left  with scratches but two deep cuts on both of my fore arms lost a considerable amount of blood plus sikua nimekula kitu kijana nikashikwa na kizungu zungu na ka light head ache , anyways NI life, nikaruka hapo chemist ,kwa pocket nikona 120 fare exact ya kunirudisha mtaa ikabidi nibuy Bandages hapo and painkillers, 100bob ikazama. Nikishuka complex nirudi offe Ile kamaji ya kumeza dawa ilikua ishaskuma my bladder, nayoo choche nisake base ya kunyora ,

Kijana light headed,sijui nilipiga chuom ngapi before kusettle for the next corner little did I know,chuom NI guarded, like a friend of mine likes to say "" karibu na mzuri"" , hio yako si mbogi , vijana Ka Saba pale, capes NI different colours, donning style NI the same,tip quarter Inches away kufunika brows, (and I swear I did see a familiar face) ,taxin ishawafikisha Maldives kila msee na there bottled water, khat stock at hand na a single half a litre  best gin hapo Kati Kati Yao next to a 'one love' jamming Bluetooth speaker. This isn't usually the best time to back down, ""karibu na .....


""Kuja karibia , let's dooh"", they simultaneously yelped in my moment of hesitation, turns out it was a fave spot for lavatory seekers, on quick thought I told them ' Niko pale offe ya mama Mikey mnatokea hio maneno ya USAID, they sighed in agreement and whispered assurances amongst themselves, pointed me to a trashed piled corner as I gave afew of the  interested fist bumps, did my deed and was out of that corner asap.

Once  out of the back street I realised I didn't come out the same street I came in, but risking retracing my steps back through the same backstreet? Nop!, I'd  take my chances with this Main street that more or less gave  a bigger backstreet vibe , sijui Ka ushai jipata mtaa na hizo mtumba thrift zako za soo soo Unakaa sonkole, ghai! karibu na!

My stubborness and light headedness guided me push further down the street, then a voice yelps "" NI sawa ngapi hapo?"" A thin voice pierced the street.
Only then do I realise bandaging my forearms forced me to roll up my bloodied sleeves exposing my dawn smart watch, 'hii imeenda' , that was my thought , then a deeper one  says 'ebu nilipe' only then do I turn to a 6foot plus  thick dude with an equally thick bushed body evident from his low hanging vest  and pair of low sitting khaki shorts , the other equally tall all covered up in orange dungarees , but bare atleast from his scared chin, both had seemingly meancing grins , ushai perembwa lakini unajua hauna kakitu 😂 


I had already made peace with my fate , I tell the guys "" naeza waachia hii gesturing to my watch but peculiarly this niggs weren't interested in my cheap ass watch and walked away the Lebron built one saying something like 'utatulipa' , I quickly reverted to my miss adventure now clearly nikijua I was lost in the efin ghetto, lakini mungu NI Nani the fear of being bulldozed in an unfamiliar environment guided me to a path I was familiar with, I was in shauri Moyo, how I got that far I don't know, that angel that told me to leave my phone at mama Mikey's office ,heaven sent.

Now since I was in familiar environs I decided to take a route that goes through gikomba thrift market wale wanajua hapo rive soko ya viatu, I crossed into the market and window shopped confidently na my 20bob kwa mfuko, but then again as I combed through the crowd I see two familiar faces the two tall dudes right behind me even looking like we are shopping together they give me the same grin ,with my naivenes at the time I dismissed them as friendlies and even start cracking jokes about ladies oversized knickers as we walk together now.


Natembea Tu alafu naanza kuskia nikama nimeanza kutumia energy mob kushinda vile nilikua natumia then I throw my hand into my pockets and I find a phone ,Samsung dual something taped from the mouth piece through the screen to the ear piece and again to the back cover . I ask the dudes ,' hii NI yenu' they quickly yelp 'zii ,si yako' then now reality slaps me the face and I quickly take back steps towards the direction I was going and yank the phone as hard I could back on the road at which one of them (skiny dungaree one) picks up the phone and walks away hastely the other shouts at me 'utatulipa' and he takes off running the other direction, then I go into my other pocket and there's another phone a Nokia mtulutulu now this one taped and rubber held,  these niggs were setting me up for a mob or even get shot. Same thing , I throw the phone out on the road towards their direction,then as I walk away past a mtumba vendor he whispers "" kijana umeokoka wezi sugu ""

Africa,"foreign aid, foreign aid",Title: I grew up idolizing France. Now I see the whole system for what it is.,"I want to believe we still have what it takes—even if I’m using technology right now to make my case.

I grew up in a former French African colony. Like many of us, I thought French civilization was the peak of human achievement. Why wouldn’t I? I was raised on French literature, those old black-and-white films with De Funès, Jean Gabin, Delon, Ventura. I even spoke the language with a generic Parisian accent—despite not being French or even living there.

Then came French schools, French book clubs, the French high school diploma, and finally the privilege of studying in France.

I wasn’t the best student, but I always had this urge to deeply understand things before accepting them. That’s when I began to regret brushing off philosophy. Turns out, it’s not just abstract fluff—it’s a rigorous method to structure thought. Even mathematics, I realized, is just philosophy dressed in symbols.

But once my studies were done, I was hit with something I didn’t expect: a deep, almost institutionalized self-loathing in the country I once revered.

Not the kind of introspection that makes people kinder or more open-minded. No, this was something more vicious. A culture that punishes effort and rewards inertia—all in the name of buzzwords like “inclusion,” “diversity,” “foreign aid,” and “subsidies.” Empty mantras the average person doesn’t really buy into but is too tired or scared to question.

How did a country that once symbolized reason, order, and rural richness become a machine that spits out nonsense—and punishes those who try to love it?

Eventually, I understood: the people had been sedated. Numbed into apathy while global elites used their taxes to fund influence-peddling in *our* countries and got rich off it. It only works if the French people are passive enough not to realize they’re footing the bill—and the ""returns"" won’t benefit them or us.

Sound familiar? Promises of rosy futures, calls for sacrifice, a little more patience… We’re all on the losing side of this global con. France just uses slogans and bureaucracy; we get tampered elections and outright censorship.

We’re told to “improve governance,” “be more transparent,” and then maybe, *maybe*, we’ll earn some IMF blessing. But it’s just chess, and we’re playing with a single black pawn while others hold the board.

But there *is* another path. Not sexy, not shiny. But real.

It starts with fiscal discipline. Real investment in education—paying teachers decently, teaching three languages, philosophy, and math. That’s it. Strip it all down. Fund it through reallocating existing budgets, not new loans or flashy “projects.” Make debt interest payments transparent and boring. No mega-projects. No empty hospitals. No grand highways mortgaging the future.

Just calm, disciplined, transparent stewardship of what little we *do* control.

It won’t impress anyone on LinkedIn. But it would build generations that *think*, who don’t blindly copy but question, root themselves, and act with independent minds.

Why are we so obsessed with the flashy? They were never meant for us. And the more we chase them, the more others will treat us like well-dressed beggars.

So yeah, a zebu-drawn chariot is no Tesla Cybertruck. But at least it’s made with *our* wood, *our* iron, and *our* hands.

We just need the courage to start from there—and believe it’s worth doing.

Me? I came home. Never bothered getting a French passport. Didn’t see the point. Too much bureaucracy, and honestly, I don’t recognize what that country’s become.

Africa,"USAID, foreign aid, foreign aid",USAID a Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing?,"Just watched this and I have so many thoughts:

* *""This will be a wake-up call for African leaders""* I disagree they are very insulated from this crisis & to begin with a lot of African leaders are very happy with the AID complex ... it works for them, the americans and whomever need someone to collude with locally, they would have done something sooner if this didn't work for them. 
* *""USAID was more about a covert operation""* This sounds like a conspiracy to me, USAID is a way to perpetuate american soft power and influence, they would threaten to cut off a government doesn't fall in line but also provide aid to friendly governments even when those very governments are undemocratic. The actual aid workers, asproblematic as they are (think white saviours to the elite class of continental Africans who find work in these organizations), were not likely to be doing any covert operation.
* ""Trump is looking after his people"" ok let's see how this money is returned to the American people?!
* The GMO / HIV AIDs thing: now I know where she is coming from but this is a massive over simplification and again like a conspiracy theory

The truth is the US & many other global actors who don't have the interest of African's in mind and have very deliberately fostered a reliance on foreign aid in many nations. This has been an intentional polical project. **I agree with her** about USAID being linked to resource extraction and never actually being enough to create change. This isn't how the world should work, I agree. But **cutting off aid on a whim could cost lives.** 

Moreover making the jump from a reliance on aid to the wealth being extracted from Africa actually going back into Africa is sooo complicated even though it has to happen it won't happen over night. There soo much to change in order for this to become a reality and essentialy this is a power move on the part of the USA that disregards people's lives.

Africa,"foreign aid, foreign aid","From Tanzania to Zimbabwe: How Africa's Ruling Elite Stay in Power, Summarised","From Tanzania to Zimbabwe, Africa's ruling elites have mastered the art of staying in power. Our investigation reveals how they control foreign aid, export revenues, and patronage networks to maintain their grip while development stagnates.

# The ""Gatekeeper"" Mechanism

African leaders have perfected what political scientists call ""extraversion"" - positioning themselves as essential gatekeepers between international resources and their distribution domestically. This creates a perverse system where leaders benefit from maintaining economic dependency rather than fostering true development.

In 2020, Tanzania's President Magufuli claimed an 84% victory in elections widely criticized by the EU for lack of transparency. This follows a pattern across the continent where incumbents use state resources to suppress opposition and manipulate electoral processes.

What makes this possible? These leaders control crucial incoming financial flows:

* Export revenues (primarily from minerals and agricultural commodities)
* Foreign aid (constituting up to 90% of government budgets in countries like Ethiopia)
* International loans and investments

Instead of reinvesting these resources into diversifying their economies, ruling elites extract wealth to fuel patronage networks and offshore accounts. Angola's elite, for instance, has become one of the biggest investors in Portugal's economy while non-oil sectors at home remain starved of investment.

# The External Support Paradox

Perhaps most troubling is how Western nations often enable these authoritarian systems while claiming to champion democracy. Countries like Uganda and Rwanda receive substantial backing from Washington, London, and Paris despite their increasingly autocratic governance.

Why? These regimes are seen as guarantors of stability and valuable allies against threats like Al-Shabaab in Somalia. This creates a situation where:

1. Western powers provide legitimacy and resources to corrupt regimes
2. China offers no-strings-attached alternatives when Western pressure becomes inconvenient
3. Leaders can play these external actors against each other to maximize benefits

This undermines accountability and allows the perpetuation of local systems of inequality. As Yale historian Frederick Cooper notes, this produces ruling elites ""distant from the population it governed, exercising control over a narrow range of resources focused at the juncture of domestic and world economies.""

# Economic Stagnation and Growing Inequality

The consequences for ordinary Africans are severe. Despite narratives of ""Africa Rising,"" poverty remains endemic in many countries. The African Development Bank reports that in Nigeria, despite its oil wealth, poverty increased from 55% to 61% between 2004 and 2020, with the number of people living in poverty rising from 19 million in 1970 to 90 million by 2000.

With weak domestic tax bases and little incentive to develop independent business sectors, these economies remain vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations and donor whims. Meanwhile, the disconnect between rulers and citizens grows wider.

# Is Change Possible?

Some hope may come from initiatives like the proposed African ""common market"" to allow free flow of people, goods, and capital between nations. The African Union's increasingly active peacekeeping role and efforts to hold former dictators accountable (like Hissène Habré's trial in Dakar) represent small steps toward greater accountability.

But until the fundamental economic structures enabling gatekeeper politics are addressed, Africa's ruling elites will likely continue refining their strategies for maintaining power while development stagnates.

What do you think can be done to break this cycle? Are there examples of African countries successfully moving beyond this pattern of governance?

I got this from this article on Global Geneva:

Is there a reason for example like South Africa doesn't send? I don't know what an established military team to like break up the conflict or is there just too many groups involved in the conflict? Like can someone with better insight explain it to me so I can gain a better understanding please?

In a remarkably short time, the second Trump administration has upended many of the precepts that have guided international order since the end of World War II. President Donald Trump has rapidly redefined the U.S. role in NATO while questioning U.S. defense guarantees to Europe and Japan and even intelligence sharing with its Five Eyes partners: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. At the United Nations, the United States has sided with Russia and other erstwhile adversaries, such as Belarus and North Korea, and against nearly all its traditional democratic allies. European officials, scrambling to react, have begun wondering whether they need to develop their own nuclear deterrents and whether Washington will continue to maintain U.S. troops on the continent.

Yet just as important as these security considerations is the administration’s rejection of the treaties, organizations, and economic institutions that the United States has done so much to shape. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued executive orders to withdraw from the [UN](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/topics/united-nations) Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and imposed a 90-day pause on all delivery of U.S. foreign aid. In early February, he ordered a sweeping 180-day review of all international organizations to which the United States belongs and “all conventions and treaties to which the United States is a party.” And more aggressive moves may be coming: Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for the second Trump administration, which has anticipated many Trump policies, calls for a U.S. exit from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/international-monetary-fund) (IMF) and the World Bank, cornerstones of global development and economic stability that the United States has for decades guided with a firm hand.

Full text: 
The Geopolitics of Tariffs
By George Friedman

There are two analytic principles worth repeating before delving into the raft of tariffs the Trump administration issued last week. The first is that we have entered into an unanchored world order, a state in which one geopolitical era transitions to the next. All things that were certain in the past have become uncertain – the storm before the calm that I applied to U.S. politics.

The second is the distinction between geopolitical imperatives and geopolitical engineering. Geopolitical imperatives force nations to act in certain (and predictable) ways. Geopolitical engineering is how nations manage their geopolitical imperatives, a process that requires balancing a nation’s domestic politics between those who welcome the new reality and those who oppose it. The outcome is predictable, even if the process by which it emerges is less so, apart from the outcome dictated by geopolitical reality.

With that in mind, the current geopolitical reality is this: The world order that had been in place throughout the 20th century has eroded, and a new era is being engineered. We are in a period in which the norms of the past century are no longer relevant. It is an infrequent and unsettling time, but throughout human history, this has been a normal abnormality.

The order of the past 100 years or so began with Western European empires, which used their access to the Atlantic Ocean to dominate much of the rest of the world, particularly the non-European parts of the Eastern Hemisphere. Eastern Europe was largely excluded from imperial power. The United Kingdom took the lion’s share of imperial wealth, followed by France, Spain and the Netherlands. That the Continent was so fragmented into independent states made war inevitable.

This European century comprised three distinct phases. The first was Germany’s attempt to restructure its imperium and thus Europe, leading to the First World War. The second phase was World War II, which resulted in a weak and divided Europe but an ascendant power in the Soviet Union and the United States. Their respective needs to access the Atlantic and to control Atlantic Europe led to the third phase, the Cold War. The U.S. and the Soviets partitioned Europe, the former taking the west and the latter taking the east. The conflict that ensued featured a confrontation in Europe along the east-west divide and, crucially, a global proxy war for the vestiges of Europe’s empires. Direct wars, proxy battles, and covert and overt operations were waged in Africa and Asia, the Middle East and South America, always contained by the geopolitical reality of mutual assured destruction through nuclear war.

Central to U.S. Cold War strategy was the creation of an economic system that benefited Washington at Moscow’s expense. The economic benefits of allying with the U.S. outweighed the benefits of allying with the Soviets. Moscow could offer support to regimes that ruled a country but not to the country itself. The U.S. could do both. Washington used its vast wealth to manage Western Europe and the so-called Third World. It engineered a strategy to liberalize and facilitate trade throughout the U.S.-led capitalist West. This strategy included tariffs, which allowed recovering European and emerging Third World economies to access the U.S. market. Free trade – as a principle if not a reality – was thus a major weapon in the Cold War, one that helped rebuild Western Europe and undermine the Soviet Union. It wasn’t cheap, but the U.S. was able to foot the bill. Its wealth allowed its economy to operate effectively in spite of imbalanced tariffs and foreign aid. It was politically successful too; U.S. domestic prices stayed low because of the low costs of imported goods, produced as they were by cheap labor. It was a win-win for the U.S. and its client states.

In some ways, the Cold War outlived the fall of communism. Russia remained a military power, and the U.S. continued its strategy of military and economic warfare. But the war in Ukraine was the true nail in the Cold War coffin. The limits of Russian military and economic power forced Washington to reconsider its imperative to resist Russia by defending Europe and, indeed, the very value of the economic dimension of the Cold War. The transfer of industrial production to areas of the collapsed European alliance created a system of reliance in the U.S. on foreign production.

In simple terms, this means that the suspension or disruption of exports from these countries, especially China, could undermine the U.S. economy. The countries on which the U.S. depended were subject to internal forces such as strikes, insurrections, coups and so on. The financial costs and benefits to the United States in this relationship have changed, and the risks of dependency are growing greater as offshoring increases. For example, China might choose to forego the economic benefits of exports to the U.S. in favor of the political or military benefits of weakening American production. Strikes or unrest in Europe might do the same, even without the intent of harming the United States.

Free trade – or trade in which tariffs strengthen other countries’ finances and weaken the buyer’s economy – can become so extreme that the risks outweigh the benefits. The financial dimension may be positive or negative for a nation, but the availability of manufactured goods depends not only on the benefits to the exporting countries but also on the geopolitical ambitions (and the stability) of those countries. China is a historically unstable country. Other countries are more or less so. The danger of a nation that is unable to continue shipping essential products to the U.S. because of ambition, war or instability is magnified insofar as it relies on imports to drive its own economy.

Availability and low prices are not guaranteed in international trade. The U.S. created a system that was in theory beneficial but in reality vulnerable to internal events in exporting countries. However, accompanied by accelerating financial imbalances, the system became obsolete. It is therefore unsurprising that as the Russian threat subsides, the U.S. is changing its strategies, including on trade.

We are moving from a process of imperatives generated by geopolitical realities to the engineering of a new reality. Financial matters are part of the economic process just as military matters are part of the geographic process, and both are part of geopolitics. The recent surge in tariffs is part of the reengineering of the financial system. Whereas broad geopolitical analysis has a disconcerting elegance, engineering has a more detailed reality. Consider a river and the engineering of a bridge over it. The course of the river is predictable. Engineering is more complex and susceptible to error. When we look at President Donald Trump’s recent actions, the river must be crossed, but building a bridge is complex and uncertain – and vulnerable to error. Thus, a blueprint for redefining the system must be designed, though the outcome of Trump’s initial actions is uncertain, even if their intent seems clear.

His intention is to shock the system, and I assume to open the door to more precise engineering, though this must be demonstrated in history and then either codified as the prior system was or rapidly discarded as an economic failure. There are many economic interests in sectors of the U.S. economy where the immediate benefit outweighs the long-term risks, as well as sectors where the financial reality has already had a great impact. Trump is clearly trying to get as much done as he can within his first 100 days – before the honeymoon period ends. With about 20 days left, and with the Democrats recovering from the shock of defeat and the Republicans unsure but still loyal, Trump may conclude that long-term planning and coalition building are impossible. But as other presidents before him have done, he is acting quickly and drastically, hoping to revise later as needed. This is an engineering matter, acting with unexpected speed in a seemingly incoherent way, restructuring when forced to retreat by strong opposition nationally and internationally but having established the strategic principle for the negotiations that will engineer the outcome.

The imperative is to move beyond the trading system that Russia’s weakness made obsolete. This behavior is not unprecedented, and it was not conjured from thin air. But the engineering is where uncertainty lives. The unanchored world is trying to find a new anchor.",2025-04-10,7,1,https://geopoliticalfutures.com/the-geopolitics-of-tariffs/,https://reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/1jw5br4/the_geopolitics_of_tariffs/

Today I’m working at an organization staring down deep cuts that my position might not survive. So no, I don’t have a lot of affection for what the U.S. has done to foreign assistance lately. And I’ve watched as other donors join in the race to the bottom. Demoralizing for sure.

But here’s the thing I’ve been wrestling with: what if some good actually comes out of this?

Let’s be honest. Even before this administration aid budgets weren’t exactly overflowing. But somehow we kept announcing new initiatives. New programs. New organizations. All drawing from the same shrinking pool of funds.

It's left developing countries navigating a maze of compounding and sometimes conflicting reporting requirements, audits, frameworks, and buzzwords all just to access less and less support.

At a certain point, you have to ask: who is this system really built for? Could this moment be an opportunity? To rethink how development actually works. To consolidate, streamline and modernize what already exists. To make access to funding simpler. Fewer layers. Fewer hoops. Maybe to make reforms happen that would have been unlikely otherwise?

I’m not saying this is how change *should* happen. There were far better, way less painful ways. But if we’re stuck with this reality maybe it forces the sector to rebuild smarter. Maybe we end up with a system that better serves the countries it’s supposed to help and better reflects the values that brought so many of us into this work to begin with.

Timeline of the USAID Global Health Shutdown: 

JANUARY 2025

Jan 20: Trump issues an executive order halting most U.S. foreign aid, including lifesaving health programs.

Jan 25: USAID terminates contracts for half of its global health staff, including doctors, disease experts, and support teams.

Jan 28: Secretary of State Marco Rubio issues a ""humanitarian exception"" for life-saving aid. 

Jan 31: 19 more staff are put on leave under a new executive order targeting “gender ideology.” Staff working on women’s health were among those targeted.

FEBRUARY 2025

Feb 1–6: Enrich approves emergency Ebola response under the humanitarian waivers. Partners are told to restart operations.

But USAID leadership secretly blocks payments, making it impossible to act.

Feb 7: Financial systems are shut down, and DOGE refuses to turn them back on.

NGOs that work with USAID cannot implement those life-saving programs as they have not been recieving paymens.

Feb 11–14: USAID leaders claim the humanitarian aid wasn’t paused. They then rewrite the rules, stripping Enrich and his team ability to authorize humanitarian waivers. 

From that day forward, not a single lifesaving health program was approved again (until yesterday, when several TB programs were un-terminated but with no guidance). 

Feb 23: After a court order expires, only 70 Global Health employees remain out of 783. The rest are fired, furloughed, or locked out.

Feb 24–26: USAID leadership:

- Kills programs for Ebola, Polio, maternal health, malnutrition, and more.

- Terminates UNICEF’s contract, halting Ebola response during a deadly outbreak in Uganda.

- Ignores warnings that these decisions will lead to mass death and global disease spread.

They argue the TRO doesn’t stop them from using other legal loopholes (outside the EO) to suspend or cancel funding.

Now they’re asking the court to either clarify the order or let them appeal.

InternationalDev,USAID,USAID’s largest partners report furloughs for thousands of staff,"“The dismantling of U.S. foreign assistance isn’t just affecting USAID — it’s scorching even the biggest aid organizations across the world,” reports Elissa Miolene for Devex News.

For more than 50 years, FHI 360 has reached thousands across the world. In Ethiopia, that has meant treating children suffering from malnutrition; in Ukraine, that’s meant bringing mobile medical clinics to communities with bombed-out hospitals. 

Those programs were funded by USAID, the agency which, three weeks ago, was the largest bilateral donor in the world. But over the last three weeks, USAID has been brought to pieces. And day by day, its partners have gone down with it. 
FHI 360 is just one of countless organizations to be hit, furloughing 36% of its staff — including 200 in its North Carolina headquarters — last week alone. 

“Most leaders are in firefighting mode,” said Kim Kucinskas, a director at the nonprofit group Humentum. But at the same time, she said, organizations have had to continue to ensure they’re keeping on top of other programs not funded by the U.S. government. “It’s this balance between crisis management, and needing to keep the trains running on time.”

Today, eight organizations — including some of USAID’s largest contracting partners, DAI and Chemonics International — sued President Donald Trump, USAID, the U.S. Department of State, and others for “irreparable harm” in the wake of USAID’s dismantling. 

In the lawsuit, the organizations laid out the damage: DAI, for example, has furloughed between 65% and 70% of its workforce — some 383 employees — and reduced salaries for senior staff members by 20%. Democracy International, a nonprofit focused on democratic governance, has furloughed 100% of its 95 U.S.-based employees and placed 163 staff members overseas — 92% of those abroad — on administrative leave. And Chemonics International, an organization that was once a USAID contracting powerhouse, has furloughed 750 of its U.S.-based staff — more than 63% of its American workforce — and reduced the hours of another 300. 
“These programs cannot simply be restarted on command,” the lawsuit states. “USAID’s partners are hemorrhaging resources and employees.” 

The list goes on. Management Sciences for Health, a Virginia-based nonprofit, has furloughed half its U.S. staff, with the court filing stating the organization may soon terminate another 1,000 employees abroad. HIAS, a nonprofit focused on refugee resettlement, has laid off 500 of its international staff. There are reports of deep cuts at Catholic Relief Services and Resonance, a Vermont-based contractor, has laid off all but a dozen of its 100-person workforce.

The International Republican Institute, or IRI — a nonprofit focused on freedom and democracy — has also been forced to furlough two-thirds of its workforce, some 200 people. More are expected to follow, and IRI is now shutting down more than 20 of its offices overseas, according to someone with knowledge of the organization’s internal decision-making. 
USAID Stop-Work, a coalition of former, current, and affiliated USAID staff, has counted more than 11,300 American jobs lost across 43 states — and nearly 52,000 across the world. 

“Without having money in place, organizations have had to lay off staff and or stop procurement orders for essential products, and that is not something that can just be turned back on if money were to become available,” said one former USAID official, who spoke during a virtual press conference assembled by USAID staff last week. “This has resulted in consequences for every region in the world.” 

Smaller organizations often receive lines of credit from USAID, which they draw on to do the contracted work. Larger organizations often do that contracted work, and then invoice USAID for reimbursement. With USAID’s payment system frozen since last month, both systems have been broken. In Central America, that means shelters previously supporting young people fleeing gang recruitment are now closed; across the world, that means $150 million of health commodities, including antiretroviral medications, are stranded in warehouses. 

“It’s in the hundreds of millions of dollars owed for services already provided, and of course, some multiples of that when it comes to what is being asked to be floated during the 90-day review,” said Tom Hart, the president and chief executive officer of InterAction. “That’s why at least in the INGO sector, we’re seeing mass layoffs, country programs stopped, and some organizations looking at shutting their doors.” 

Organizations have been forced to shift money around to cover costs or lay off staff to save on program expenses. And for many of USAID’s largest partners, that means they’re out millions of dollars for work they’ve already done. 

The Professional Services Council, or PSC, a trade association of more than 400 government contractors, said federal agencies currently owe its members some $500 million in unpaid work. 

Humentum surveyed 100 organizations to ask the same, finding that nearly three-quarters of respondents said their organization had not been paid for work completed before Jan. 24. The court filing breaks things down further: DAI is owed $120 million for work completed before the stop-work order began while Chemonics is out $103.6 million for the same. 

The U.S. seeks to gut UNICEF work plans of references promoting “gender ideology,” and diversity, equity and inclusion.

“What happens when those invoices are not paid?” said PSC’s president, David Berteau, in a press release. “Without reimbursement for funds already disbursed, companies will run short of cash.” 

Earlier today, Kucinskas gathered human resource leaders for Humentum’s people and culture roundtable, a regular convening of those across the global development space. The mood was heavy as organizations compared how they were making their calculus, Kucinskas said. 

“Some said: I’ve been around for a while, and have been through crises before,” she added. “But this is a whole other level. It’s physically, emotionally, mentally exhausting.”

*\[Update to fit your situation\] I have been furloughed/laid off/am expecting to be laid off. My organization is preparing for layoffs of XXX people around the world. Hundreds of my former colleagues have already lost their jobs.* 

*There are legitimate debates to have about the effectiveness of foreign aid, and I personally believe reform is needed. But decisions like this belong to Congress. The unilateral move to shut down USAID without congressional approval sets a dangerous precedent and paves the way for the executive branch to dismantle other agencies at will.*

*It has also been really hurtful to see my community, people who have dedicated their lives and careers to the idea that we can make the world a better place, be vilified by the President and Elon Musk, called ""criminals"" and ""vipers.""* 

*That’s why I’m asking for your help in contacting your representatives to oppose this unconstitutional overreach, regardless of your views on foreign aid. I've included a call script and where to find contact information for each of your representatives. (Calls are taken more seriously than emails by Members of Congress.)* 

*I’d also welcome the opportunity to talk more about the impact of this decision or answer any questions you have about USAID or foreign aid.*

***Staffer’s Likely Response:*** *Thank you for your call. What specifically concerns you?*

***You:*** *The executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to unilaterally shut down a government agency or freeze funding appropriated by Congress. If this action goes unchallenged, it sets a dangerous precedent that could extend to other agencies and programs.

2. Finding partners and creating those relationships.

InternationalDev,"foreign aid, foreign aid",The stop work orders are blatantly illegal. Where is the legal action?,"It seems like no one is suing the Trump administration over the blanket stop work orders on foreign aid awards -- is this true? Last week's executive order and State Department memo are blatant violations of the Impoundment Control Act, among other laws.

A huge coalition of nonprofits and state AGs [sued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-28/trump-administration-sued-over-omb-halt-to-federal-grants?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy) hours after the federal payments freeze was announced, and they appear to be winning. Meanwhile, my sources in the INGO community say that no organization is willing to step up and serve as plaintiff in a similar case regarding the foreign aid freeze, which took effect days earlier, and instead everyone is just going along with the stop work orders and furloughing/firing staff. Is this right? If so, our democracy and world are in far graver trouble than I thought.

Laws don't enforce themselves, and fairness doesn't rule naturally. If no one fights for these bedrock principles, they will just wither away. Not to mention all the harm that is already transpiring from the cessation of these critical global programs.

InternationalDev,"USAID, foreign aid, foreign aid",Message from Ken Jackson to USAID staff,"This was forwarded to me (an IP employee) and I thought other IP employees might find it worth reading. At the very least, there is recognition that foreign assistance will exist for decades to come: 

Msg sent to USAID staff —USAID Teammates,This past election, the American people sent a clear mandate: they expect a government that serves their interests. Over the past week, we have seen that our President is committed to delivering an America First policy. We have a responsibility to support the President in achieving his vision. This will require each of us to be flexible, to work at a pace we may not be accustomed to, to challenge the basic assumptions surrounding foreign aid, and to make decisions that ensure the United States becomes safer, stronger, and more prosperous.This past week, the Acting Administrator and Agency Front Office have provided significant guidance and instruction, covering everything from eliminating DEIA to providing direction on returning to in-person work. I appreciate your hard work so far. Nevertheless, we are just beginning to implement the President’s agenda, so there is a need for clear expectations going forward. First, the pause on all foreign assistance means a complete halt. Guidance provided specifies that the only exceptions to this pause are for emergency humanitarian food assistance and for government officials returning to their duty stations. The waiver for humanitarian food assistance is explicit—be prepared to provide detailed information and justification for any emergency humanitarian food assistance delivered during the current review period.Second, a waiver process for any expenditures beyond emergency humanitarian food assistance is in place. All requests for waivers will go through designated leaders and must be approved by me and the Director for Foreign Assistance before being submitted to the Secretary of State for final approval. Any waiver must be thoroughly justified to demonstrate that the specific assistance for which the waiver is sought is necessary for lifesaving purposes, cannot be performed by current U.S. direct hire staff, or would otherwise pose significant risks to national security.Third, as outlined in the President’s Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid, all foreign assistance programs will undergo a comprehensive review. More information about the review process and the criteria for determining whether programs will continue will be provided in the coming days. It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized.Fourth, all communications outside the Agency, including to the State Department, must be approved by the Agency Front Office.Finally, I want to emphasize how important these priorities are to the President and the American people who voted for an America First agenda. Failure to abide by this directive, or any of the directives sent out earlier this week and in the coming weeks, will result in disciplinary action. I will hold leaders accountable to ensure their employees adhere to these expectations.The President has given us a tremendous opportunity to transform the way we approach foreign assistance for decades to come. I hope each of you will roll up your sleeves and join me in making President Trump’s vision a reality.With gratitude,Ken Jackson Assistant to the Administrator for Management and Resources",2025-01-26,68,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1iafmjx/message_from_ken_jackson_to_usaid_staff/,https://reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1iafmjx/message_from_ken_jackson_to_usaid_staff/
InternationalDev,USAID,I’m worried Trump’s admin is working to dismantle/dramatically shrink USAID,"I’ve been reflecting on State’s recent memo regarding foreign assistance, which you can read [here](https://bsky.app/profile/kenklippenstein.bsky.social/post/3lgiwkjeae22h)

They are going to review all active foreign assistance grants, contracts, and subcontracts to, “ensure that all foreign assistance is aligned with President Trump’s foreign policy agenda.” Every Bureau/office/entity providing foreign assistance has to provide a list and state how they think each one is advancing Trump’s agenda.

This feels ominous. It feels like the beginning of a massive restructuring. Does global health align with his agenda (especially for our colleagues in family planning, HIV/AIDS, and immunization)? Does gender equality? Does climate resilience? This feels like an excuse to cut entire offices.

Leaving out an exemption for institutional support contractors from the cable feels especially concerning. Maybe it was an oversight, but what if it was intentionally done to cripple USAID operations? 

It feels like they came way more prepared this time with a clear understanding of how this system works. If this is indeed a major restructuring, this will decimate an entire industry. It’s not just USAID employees - it’s implementing partners around the world. We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Does anyone have reassurance or more insight into any checks and balances that exist to prevent this from happening?",2025-01-25,63,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1i9pbo7/im_worried_trumps_admin_is_working_to/,https://reddit.com/r/InternationalDev/comments/1i9pbo7/im_worried_trumps_admin_is_working_to/

We know that our intentions for our work are noble, and while there are valid criticisms of US foreign aid, gutting an entire industry and potentially putting thousands of people out of work is not the right way to address those criticisms.

humanitarian,"USAID, foreign aid, foreign aid",Collating and Crystallizing the Losses to USAID Global Health from the March 2 Enrich Memo,"I spent time this week collating the projected humanitarian losses shared in the memo leaked by Nicholas Enrich, acting assistant administrator for global health at USAID a week ago (""[U.S.A.I.D. Memos Detail Human Costs of Cuts to Foreign Aid](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/usaid-cuts-deaths-infections.html)"", *New York Times*, March 2).

**TLDR:** I've analyzed and extrapolated the leaked USAID memo data into a clear 4-page summary revealing **2.6-4.5 million annual deaths** globally, potential **15-38 million pandemic deaths**, and **$2-3 billion annual US costs**. My document organizes these impacts and adds strategic projections not found in the original. \[PDF link below\]

While the data was well-detailed in the leaked memo, it is still a little hard to get at, and did not include totals. Furthermore, there are certain extrapolations that can reasonably be made, to get to some idea of the projected losses.

I wanted to get as clear as possible about:

* Projected deaths globally
* Projected deaths in the U.S.
* Projected economic impacts in the U.S.

This gives us some basis to start *seeing* the magnitude of the damage, of what has been done.

What I did was use AI (Claude and ChatGPT, cross-compared), and then went through each number to double-check it (they did not make any mistakes, by the way). The AI was also able to do things like go into the footnotes and integrate information with related data in the tables to accurately add greater detail.

I end the document with a series of strategic projections about the damage done by these actions, and an easy-to-read set of cascading effect chains that clearly draw out the multiple layers of impact, without becoming overwhelming.

These can be used by journalists, aid workers, and regular citizens to surface more clarity and meaning around the damage done.

humanitarian,"USAID, foreign aid, foreign aid",Foreign Aid Freeze on USAID,"The Trump Administration has implemented a freeze on all foreign us aid. This also includes all jobs that are contracted through USAID both in the US and internationally. Many people that I know and love are directly impacted by this. In addition, their jobs are on the line. I HIGHLY encourage you to please write a letter to your senators and representatives. Please see template below. 

Letter template:

Dear [Senator/Representative’s Last Name],  

I am writing as a concerned citizen and constituent regarding the recent stop-work order issued by the Trump administration and Secretary Marco Rubio, halting all USAID operations for 85 days. This unprecedented decision has devastating implications for U.S. foreign aid, global stability, and national security.  

As someone who believes in the importance of international cooperation and humanitarian efforts, I am alarmed by the ripple effects of this decision. USAID’s annual budget of approximately $30 billion supports vital programs in health, education, and economic development, benefiting millions of people in developing countries. These programs not only provide critical aid but also promote stability, reduce terrorism, and address migration pressures.  

The suspension of USAID operations impacts thousands of jobs, both in the United States and abroad. Local aid workers in developing countries will lose their income, violating labor laws in many of these nations and creating economic hardships for vulnerable communities. Additionally, this decision undermines decades of bipartisan efforts to promote global health and security, such as the successful PEPFAR program launched under President George W. Bush.  

Foreign aid is not just a moral imperative—it is a strategic investment in U.S. national security. By strengthening economies and providing alternatives to extremism and forced migration, USAID programs help to create a safer and more stable world for everyone.  

I urge you to stand against this decision and advocate for the immediate reversal of the stop-work order on USAID operations. Your leadership is critical in preserving the values and priorities that have long defined America’s role on the global stage.  

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I hope to see your support for restoring USAID’s vital work and safeguarding both global stability and U.S. interests.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]

globalhealth,"foreign aid, budget cuts, foreign aid","PEPFAR facing $3B in cuts, experts warn of 16M excess deaths by 2040","One of the most effective health programs ever created, the U.S.-funded PEPFAR initiative, is facing massive budget cuts under the FY 2026 federal budget proposal \[1\]. These cuts threaten to undo decades of progress, potentially leading to millions of preventable deaths.

PEPFAR (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) is the largest commitment by any nation to fight a single disease. Since 2003, by providing antiretroviral treatments and prevention programs (through education, condoms distribution and preventing transmission from mother to child)  it has:

* Saved an estimated over 25 million lives \[2\]  
* Reduced HIV-related mortality by up to 40% in many countries  
* Delivered treatment and prevention to millions of children and families

The President’s FY 2026 budget proposes:

* $1.9 billion in annual cuts to PEPFAR’s bilateral programs  
* An additional $1 billion in rescissions targeting already-approved global health funding \[3\]

Combined, all proposed cuts to global health programs would save the average (mean) American less than $30 per year, a rounding error in the federal budget (about 0.07%). But they could result in up to 16 million excess HIV-related deaths by 2040, according to UNAIDS and modeling by Georgetown University researchers \[4\].

These are evidence based programs with measurable impacts at an extremely high scale. If you live in the US, taking 5 minutes to send an email or call to your representatives can make a difference. Congressional offices log every message, and a small number of well-informed letters can shift priorities, especially when bipartisan programs like PEPFAR and other global health programs are on the line. A respectful message that signals you are part of the congressperson’s constituency (as far as you can without lying if they aren’t) can have a massive effect.

Here’s a link to find your senators/representative:  [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) 

I’m starting medical school at UCLA this fall, planning a career in global health. I’ve already contacted my senators and representative. If you care about reducing suffering as much as possible, this is one of the most consequential moments to act.

But then, why is there so much support for tariffs here, particularly towards China? Tariffs are still government intervention, and they basically make everything more expensive for regular Americans. If the idea is that we shouldn't hurt ourselves for the sake of foreign policy, why is it different when it comes to China? Why am I having to sacrifice and spend more of my money for a policy goal that shouldn't bother me?",2025-04-25,0,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1k7tr78/why_are_a_lot_of_you_against_foreign_aid_but/,https://reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1k7tr78/why_are_a_lot_of_you_against_foreign_aid_but/
AskConservatives,funding cuts,"What do you think about Trump extending refugee status offers to 67,000 white South Africans?","Trump [signed an EO prioritizing humanitarian aid to Afrikaners](https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-refugee-afrikaner-south-africa-0fbca411470d3b439886cabc12c7600d) (specifically white South African farmers), and directed Marco Rubio and Krisiti Noem to work on a plan to resettle them in the U.S. So far 67,000 Afrikaners have expressed interest in the program.

This seems really at odds with an America first agenda. Many farmers in the states are struggling and losing their farms due to federal funding cuts, but Trump wants to bring over 67,000 Afrikaners, many of which are farmers. American families are struggling working multiple jobs to put food on the table. Almost 60% of Americans feel financailly uncomfortable, with 34% living paycheck to paycheck. It seems like brining tens of thousands of foreigners in with potentiallly low skillsets would be terrible for Americans. Many of these farmers will need to recieve aid to fly over here, get housing, jobs, maybe retraining... basically welfare.

What do you think about this situation? Do you think if this were being reported in conservative news that it would be a popular idea? Doesn't it seem hypocritical to bring in tens of thousands of foreingers when we are supposed to be brining prices down and improving the cost of living for American citizens?

AskConservatives,"foreign aid, foreign aid","How do we respond to questions on supporting Israeli foreign policy, when we prefer non-intervention and less spending?","I know it's a paradox and honestly, I have been caught like a deer in the headlights a few times over it.

On one hand, non-intervention and less military spending make sense from a foreign policy and fiscal policy standpoint, if US interests are to be served and fiscal discipline is to be achieved (Next to Social Security and Medicare, the third trillion dollar budget mountain is Defense Spending). The argument is simple to make for a reason: What benefit does giving arms and money to others help US? Afghanistan, Iraq, and so many others in recent history have burned trillions without any returns on investment.

On the other hand, Conservatives and especially Religious/Social Conservatives have had a long history of supporting Israeli foreign policy. Heck, the funding sources of many Super PACs and think tanks that Conservatives rely on are heavily funded with Pro-Israel interests. It's similar to a marriage now that even when President Trump cut Foreign Aid, Israel was exempt. Not even the UK has this kind of reciprocal relationship, but it's hard to provide reasons without getting into problems.

It's population today is around 10 Million so that equates to about $30,000 per Israeli.   Israel is one of the richest and most successful countries in the world and the $3.1B the US taxpayers give them is about .6% of their GDP so they could easily pay for this themselves

This old video of Netanyahu seems to indicate that even he has always been surprised at the level and dedication American support.  Even Trump exempted them from his foreign aid cuts.  I don't really understand why our tax dollars go to someone that doesn't even need it.  Bin Laden said this US support for Israel was the primary motivation of 911 which demonstrates there are 'cons' or risks to this support.
