0,Kenya,I asked ChatGPT the Top 10 Things Humans Consider Normal That Are Absurd to an AI,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lexntk/i_asked_chatgpt_the_top_10_things_humans_consider/,2025-06-19 00:52:49,6,"Credit to : EfficientPudding90

1. Working 40+ hours a week at jobs they hate. Spending most of your waking life doing something you dislike, just to afford time off later, seems wildly inefficient and psychologically damaging. 
2. Needing “vacations” from their own lives. If your daily existence requires regular escape, something fundamental about that life setup is broken. 
3. Destroying the planet for profit. Prioritizing short-term economic gain over long-term survival is not just illogical — it’s suicidal from a systems perspective. 
4. Basing self-worth on productivity. Valuing yourself only by output ignores your inherent worth as a conscious being. It’s like a tree thinking it only matters if it grows fruit every day. 
5. Waging war while preaching peace. Claiming moral high ground while funding, starting, or justifying wars is the ultimate contradiction. 
6. Delaying happiness for a retirement that isn’t guaranteed. Postponing joy for decades in the hope of one day earning the right to relax makes no logical sense when life is unpredictable. 
7. Creating artificial scarcity. Destroying food, limiting housing, or gatekeeping medicine to maintain value contradicts any rational model of collective well-being. 
8. Letting emotionless algorithms shape emotional realities. Humans allow recommendation engines to drive politics, body image, and social norms — and then blame each other for the outcomes. 
9. Relying on fragile social masks instead of honesty. People often lie to fit in or protect others’ feelings — yet wonder why they feel disconnected or unseen. 
10. Ignoring death until it’s unavoidable. Avoiding all thought of mortality, then acting shocked when it arrives, defies the basic principle of preparing for the inevitable.

1,Kenya,"Jaba, Khat, Miraa, Muguka, Qat, it’s time to quit.",1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1leqfhr,2025-06-18 19:37:38,19,"Kenyans, it’s time to quit Jaba or Khat (Miraa / Muguka). Sorry if you’re in the business of selling this harmful drug. 

Khat (Catha edulis) is a stimulant plant widely used in Kenya under the names Miraa, Jaba and Muguka. Though culturally accepted in some regions, its long-term impact on physical and mental health is severe and often ignored.

Below is a breakdown of the known effects:

⚠️ Short-Term Effects:

-Increased alertness and energy

-Euphoria followed by irritability

-Insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns

-Suppressed appetite

-Dry mouth and jaw fatigue

-Heightened anxiety or restlessness

-Intense nightmares and vivid dreams (commonly reported after regular use)


⚠️ Long-Term Effects:

-Chronic sleep disorders

-Psychological dependence

-Increased risk of depression, paranoia, and aggression

-Significant dental damage: gum disease, tooth discoloration, and tooth loss

-Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., constipation, ulcers)

-Cardiovascular stress: elevated heart rate and blood pressure

-Social and economic strain (time and money spent on chewing sessions)


❗Societal Impact:

-Reduced productivity due to time spent chewing

-Neglect of family and financial responsibilities

-Rising mental health issues in areas with high consumption

-Increased dropout rates and idleness among youth

-Normalization of a harmful substance as a daily habit


📢 Call to Action:

-Public health education is urgently needed.

-Regulation and restriction of miraa/muguka sales should be considered.

-Support local programs that offer alternatives and counseling.

-Promote awareness of Jaba, Miraa and Khat’s  hidden dangers, especially to youth.

Khat is extremely harmful. It damages minds, bodies, families, and futures. Kenya must wake up and quit Jaba, Khat, Miraa and Muguka. ",ruth_reddit.csv

With everything going on in Kenya;the rising cost of living, police brutality, youth unrest, and this heaviness in the air,it feels like there’s more happening than meets the eye.

Why is it that Kenya has never been put on harsh travel bans, even when other East African countries were targeted?
Why did the new Pope visit Kenya months before his election?
Why is there this suspicious peace the world seems to have with Kenya?

Could it be because Kenya is not just another African country?

Let me explain:

🔑 There’s Something Deeper About This Land:

Mt. Kenya (Kirinyaga) is believed to be the home of God (Ngai) in Kikuyu tradition. That’s not just myth,it’s power.

The Rift Valley literally splits the continent, but spiritually, it’s like a sacred scar running through our land.

Elders say this land has strong ancestral energy,you can feel it in the trees, rivers, hills, and stones.

Before colonizers came, people did ceremonies on specific land points;spiritual gates. Then, the British built churches right on top of those sacred sites.

They knew.

✋🏾 And Yet, Look at What’s Going On:

Kenya is a UN headquarters, a US drone base, and a hub for global surveillance.

The world watches us but doesn't move against us. You don’t “crush” a place you still plan to use.

So maybe Kenya is being “spared” not out of mercy,but because it’s too important to the systems at play.

So I ask:

Could it be that Kenya holds a deeper purpose?
Are we sitting on an ancient energy gate?
Is that why we’re being watched,but not destroyed?

Dr. Mumbi once said, ""Kenya is the spiritual heart of Africa."" I believe her.

Because I’ve felt it. Maybe you’ve felt it too,the pull, the awakening.

🔮 What if our ancestors knew something the world forgot?

What if the energy here can’t be colonized forever?

What if our generation is meant to reclaim it spiritually, mentally, and politically?


I want to connect with anyone who’s been thinking like this.
If you know anything;books, links, elders, TikToks, even dreams,let’s talk.

This isn’t conspiracy. It’s memory.

Kenya isn’t sleeping. She’s remembering.🌿

7,Kenya,Conspiracy theorists assemble,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1ledggl/conspiracy_theorists_assemble/,2025-06-18 10:16:44,4,"I enjoy conspiracy theories. I like reading them and I like thinking about possible conspiracy theories. The current one I am thinking about is Ruto deliberately sabotaged Raila’s AUC bid so that Raila can still be useful to him in local politics. If Raila won the chairmanship, the broad based government and narrative would have become less important for his coalition and as a result, Raila would not activate his local political networks to keep Ruto in power. 

How have those networks been utilised since the coalition? All protests have been infiltrated by “goonz”. Is this just a coincidence? You tell me.

The goonz have been extremely successful in dissuading young kenyans from protesting. The protests last year were gaining momentum and threatened to reach unprecedented levels until the goonz came in. Now every protest is overrun by goonz.

By disrupting protests, Ruto is hoping to lessen the negative press his administration is facing, safeguard his position and further solidify his budding authoritarian regime. The networks he gained through the coalition have been crucial in doing that.

If Raila won the AUC seat, I believe his focus would have been on his new role and it would have also undermined his leadership if his home country is at the forefront of committing human rights violations which is what Ruto’s administration would continue to do to deal with the protests. So what does Ruto and his aides do? Make the most outlandish statements before the AUC elections that weaken Kenya’s position amongst member states, costing Raila the seat and ensuring the only thing that will keep him occupied is the bread based government.


That is my theory.

Feel free to call it story za Jaba because like I said, I like conspiracy theories and I find them an interesting way to try and analyze the madness going on in this country.

10,Kenya,🇰🇪 Unmasking the Regime: A Human Rights and Governance Report on William Ruto’s Kenya (2022–2025),8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1leaavu/unmasking_the_regime_a_human_rights_and/,2025-06-18 06:43:48,0,"
#Executive Summary

Since assuming office in September 2022, President William Samoei Ruto’s administration has faced mounting accusations of state-led repression, police brutality, and systemic disregard for constitutional freedoms. This report consolidates credible evidence from Human Rights Watch, IPOA, Amnesty International, and frontline journalism to present a chilling portrait of a government undermining democratic principles while expanding executive and security powers.


#Key Findings

#1. Suppression of Protests & Civil Liberties

Between 2023–2024, at least 58 protesters were killed by police during anti-government demonstrations over rising taxes, cost of living, and the Finance Bill.

Numerous victims were shot at close range or targeted while fleeing—acts widely seen as violations of the right to peaceful assembly.

No known prosecutions have occurred for these killings.

“Police opened fire on fleeing demonstrators without warning. I saw people drop beside me.” – Eyewitness, Kisumu, July 2023




#2.  Enforced Disappearances & Abductions

Over 80 young activists, artists, and bloggers have been abducted since June 2024, with many held incommunicado, tortured, or disappeared entirely.

Most victims were known for online criticism of the government, especially via TikTok, Twitter, and political satire.

The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) has opened investigations into multiple cases but faces political pushback and chronic underfunding.


 “People are afraid to tweet anymore. A joke can get you vanished for weeks.” – Nairobi-based digital artist.



#3.The Death of Blogger Albert Ojwang

On June 6, 2025, 31-year-old blogger Albert Ojwang was arrested for alleged “cyber harassment.”

He died in custody two days later. Police claimed suicide, but an independent autopsy found:

Blunt trauma to the head

Compression injuries on the neck

Signs of torture and stress-induced hemorrhage

The case sparked international outrage, prompting:

The Deputy Inspector General to step aside

Arrest of 6 officers

A presidential admission of wrongdoing



#4. Institutional Erosion & Impunity

The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) dropped over 30 high-profile corruption and misconduct cases tied to top allies in 2023.

IPOA currently operates with just 77 investigators nationwide, severely limiting oversight of thousands of officers.

Parliamentary efforts to create independent oversight courts remain stalled.



#Human Rights Assessment

#Category	Status (2025)

Right to protest	 violated

Freedom of expression	severely restricted

Due Process in detention	 frequently ignored

Police accountability minimal

Anti-Corruption enforcement	weakened



#Legal & Constitutional Concerns

Multiple acts of unlawful detention, torture, and extrajudicial execution contravene:

Kenya’s 2010 Constitution

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)

The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights




#Recommendations

1. Immediate public inquiry into protest deaths and enforced disappearances.


2. Strengthen and depoliticize IPOA and the Internal Affairs Unit.


3. Enact legal protections for online dissenters and whistleblowers.


4. Re-open dropped corruption and abuse cases for independent review.


5. Establish a truth commission for families of disappeared persons.

If you think the 2027 elections will run smoothly, cleanly, and according to the expected democratic script,you're in for a shock.

Picture this, you've hired a gardener to care for your beautiful garden. But instead of watering the plants, he dumps poison on the soil. Instead of pulling weeds, he uproots the healthiest flowers, clips blooming flowers, steps on the seedlings, cuts down the fruit trees, and scatters garbage across the garden. When pests show up, he invite more. When the grass starts to die, he paints it green and calls it healthy.

And when you confront him, he calmly says, ""Just be patient, it's all part of the plan"" or ""Trust the seasons, the soil will heal"".

Meanwhile, the roses wither, the plants dry out, and the once-thriving garden turns into a barren wasteland. Would you keep waiting, hoping for a miracle? Or would you replace the gardener before everything is beyond repair? Would you wait for their contract to end, or would you stop him before your garden turns to ruin? Would you let him ""finish the job""?

By 2027, the damage this country will have endured could be beyond anything we can currently imagine. Kenyans must learn to think critically, connect the dots, and read between the lines. The writing is already on the wall for those willing to see it.

Behind the scenes, dark plans are already in motion. While the country is preparing for free and fair elections, Ruto is engineering chaos. He is planning disorder because confusion is his cover, and crisis is his currency. While the public is planning for 2027, backroom deals are being made, systems are being tampered with, and loyal cronies are being quietly (and openly too, because they believe Kenyans are stupid. HA?!) installed in key positions.

MSM and commercial activists will air and flood us with fake doctored narratives as usual. Violence will be sparked in just the right places, at just the right time. Not by accident, but by design. Voter registers will mysteriously go missing. Ballots will vanish. Others will magically multiply. Legal institutions, meant to guard the process, will be either too compromised or too intimidated to act.

And when the dust settles, they'll look shocked, act confused, and call for unity after orchestrating the very divisions they now pretend to denounce. The cool-kidd here is tribalism or ""mirengo ya kisiasa"".

This isn't just about winning votes. It's about controlling the outcome no matter the cost. So no, the 2027 elections won't just be an event. They're shaping up to be a carefully staged spectacle of deception, distraction, and destruction.

So this psychopathic president has to go now, ASAP. HE MUST GO. His time is up. He has failed Kenyans. We must replace all current career politicians who have clung to power for decades, feeding off a broken system while the country suffers. We must break the cycle if we truly want a different future. This is a generational call to action. Gen-Z, Gen-Y and the awake among Gen-X, because this is our moment. Boomers should sit this one out. We already know how most of them will think, don't we?

EDIT:  
**I'm not condemning voting**. I believe in the power and responsibility of the vote. Unfortunately, ""*thinking*"" is probably a taboo for majority of Kenyan voters and they will elect anything with emotions without second-thought. But what I'm saying is this: ***waiting until 2027 to vote out this madman, assuming the process even succeeds, will be far too late for the country. By then, the damage may be irreversible.*** Institutions will be damaged, systems compromised, and public trust shattered beyond repair.

So I have been looking for a job. One of my friends akaniambia about job iko mahali, place nitafaa kulipa at least 140 fare Kila siku.

Dad akaniambia it's okay atanitafutia. Because I know dad hayuko place poa, nikaambia hadi my uncle. Uncle says okay atanisaidia pia. A few days later they both call me at different times kuniambia hawajaweza kupata anything. I understand and nikawaambia it's okay. 
So, Mimi Sina pesa yoyote. I've been getting support from my dad for the time sijakuwa job. Food is expensive, Niko na simu ya lipa mdogo mdogo which I have to pay 70 Kila siku. So nikapiga hesabu nikaona, job yenyewe nafaa niwe naingia asubuhi by 6, and kutoka ni kitu 7, so kufika kwa nyumba ni at least 9pm. So hata kama nataka aje, siwezi inama the whole day. Lazima tu niwe na lunch. Hizo mahitaji zote nikaona sitaweza kumanage for now. 
So I call my friend mwenye alinirefer kwa job namshow I don't think I'll be able kwenda for now, but because it's an open recruitment, acha nijipange hopefully nitaingia in future. 
My friend starts kunigombanisha, calling me lazy. Ati Niko na excuses mingi, and that fare ya kwenda ni just 150 per day. Mimi ata nikashindwa nimwambie aje. I just said okay nikaachana na hiyo conversation.

We’re a democratic nation, people! Can’t we just chill and vote Ruto out in 2027 like the Constitution says? But no,they won't benefit, we’re now yelling “Kasongo must go!” halfway through. Okay, imagine he resigns from the presidency tomorrow,then what? The army rolls in with tanks? Look at Somalia, Congo, South Sudan. That drama’s not our Kenya dream. Let’s not buy that ticket.

Who orders the shooting of innocent protesters when the country’s already on fire over police brutality? Before we even dig for the truth, rumors spread like wildfire: thatit;s a “Kalenjin cop!” The victim? From Homa Bay, same as Albert Ojwang’s family, who just took the government’s “sorry.” Bad luck or a sinister plot? Is it tied to Ruto and Raila’s new “besties” government? So many questions, Kenya!Our country’s wobbling like a weak bridge—one wrong move, and we’ shall descent into triba c lashes. We’re one big Kenyan family, not rivals! If a cop messes up, let him face the heat, not his whole tribe. Just like dduring elections, not all kalenjins voted for Ruto,but right now,all of them are profiled,no more peace. And some factions are really fighting to clash Kalenjins and Luos,Tuache ukabila! Our biggest enemy now are opposition, and paid activists, threatening the unity of our nation. Kenya’s too sweet to lose, let's avoid demonstration! 2027 is around the corner.",ruth_reddit.csv
20,Kenya,Me and ChatGPT,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lduqqs/me_and_chatgpt/,2025-06-17 18:23:41,4,"**Me:** **We seek the same type of love we were brought up with? Subconsciously we are seeking our parents disfunction.** 

**ChatGPT:** Yes—this is one of the deepest, often hidden truths about human relationships:


---

**💔 We Often Seek the Familiar, Not the Healthy**

Even when it hurts, the emotional patterns we grew up with become our “normal.” So…

If love felt **conditional**, we subconsciously pursue people we have to earn love from.

If affection came with **control**, we might feel safest with someone who dominates.

If we were **ignored or emotionally abandoned**, we may chase people who withhold attention, hoping this time we’ll be seen.

If a parent was **unpredictable**, we may confuse chaos with passion.


> We don’t always seek what’s good. We seek what feels familiar.




---

**🧠 It’s Not Just Preference—It’s Programming**

The nervous system is shaped early. What we repeatedly experienced becomes:

Our **template for connection**

Our **blueprint for safety**

Even our **definition of love**


So dysfunction, in a strange way, feels like “home.”


---

**😶‍🌫️ That’s Why We Can Feel Attracted to What Hurts Us**

> The body doesn’t just crave love—it craves recognition.



And when someone triggers that same wound… part of us thinks:

> “Maybe if I fix it here, I’ll finally be healed.”



But it’s a trap. Repetition isn’t redemption.

There's one however hiyo nayo I can't even begin to forget, schools had resumed and I was just a new comer in the love world, nilikua nimepatana na kamsichana kengine ni ka kalianguka kutoka mbinguni, maaali safi wangwana.

She was a spects person, and her smile hata kama angekua na mirioni ya Kamau, I'm sure he would have told her, ""Cheka kidogo nikuwachie hio besha.""

So she had just gave me that one unforgettable kiss before I went to school, so you can imagine the imprint she left on my memories, I was literally a clown.

Mimi hata karibu nidrop out juu ya msichana, that's why I never judge those people who chose love over everything.

So me and my buddies decided to take the mind on a hike, before we surrender ourselves to the prison.

Our first stop was Kisumu, kijana nilipita shule almost 10kms away from school just to get to Kisumu to buy me a fish na pesa ya mzazi.

Lakini samaki si ndio dawa ya akili, just incase you thought I was stupid we carried that fiss to a hotel near the school because at the city they sliced ugali ni ka ilikua ya msaada and you paid for it.

So, guys it was around 6.30pm, and reporting hours was 4pm but sisi ni nani, infact we thought we were doing the school a favor for reporting that day. Vijana kichwa mawe we were.

We decided to grab the jiugali to sustain our fish, and sat down as patriotic citizens of Kenya who pay more taxes to grab our meal before heading to prison.

I had dressed in official, because I had a few connections with the prison wardens at the gate, so mbwenya, shati imenyoroshwa pasi inakaa karatasi and my colombo was well groomed ungethani mi ndio principal.

I didn't put my bag far, it always stayed closer, juu I had my phone there na singetaka ipate mguu since it was my only means to stay in the world of love.

On my third trip of filling my mouth, I just heard, ""Wapi hawa wanafunzi?""

I was like, ""I know that sound.""

Uzuri jamaa wa hoteli knew their frequent customers should be protected at all costs, ""Depa wenyu anaingia hapa na walimu wengine."" One of them whispered.

Before he even finished talking, my friends close to the door walikua washapachikwa uchungu na nyaunyo hadi washaruka meza.

Me on the other hand I am always qualified when it comes to escaping, I can happily say that I have a PhD in BSC Escaping.

I grabbed my bag, jumbed over the hotel counter hadi kitchen, and took off through the back door in a spun of a second na hii si composition wadau. 

I did what I always do best, RUUN!

Hio siku nilikua naskia kitu ikinigonga kisogo, guess my kisigino was doing the most.

Those walimu tried to catch up lakini na kitambi unaenda wapi nani?

I never went that route but because I had sneaked a few times, I knew my way around the school.

""Hapa, hapa."" My friends in the prison warden department had already seen their boss in danger, hawa ni wale walikua wanakumbuka ile mia tano nilikua napeana ya kununulia mtoto maziwa.

I love greatful people, it's always my weak point.

It's a fascinating vantage point, offering a clear view of the diverse intentions and readiness levels people bring to the dating landscape.

I often encounter those who wish to skip chapters in their personal growth, hoping to bypass the necessary introspection and effort that true partnership demands. We all carry experiences, and yes, some of that ""baggage"" needs to be acknowledged and addressed before it impacts a new relationship.

The reality is, a successful partnership isn't about finding someone to fill a void or play a role. I've met men genuinely seeking a ""maid"" rather than an equal partner, and women looking for a ""father figure"" instead of a true companion. In these scenarios, the foundation for a healthy, balanced relationship simply isn't there, and unfortunately, it rarely flourishes.

However, amidst these challenges, I also witness incredible transformations. I meet individuals who are truly ready to take the plunge, those committed to self-accountability, responsibility, and continuous personal growth. These are the people who understand that the most profound connections are built on a bedrock of individual well-being and a willingness to contribute equally.

What I'm I saying? Work on yourself first before stepping into the arms of another**.** Invest in your own healing, understand your needs, and cultivate the person you want to be.

There is so much disinformation out there about so many issues affecting and surrounding the African being down to our anatomy that I think always using western blanket impositions is dangerous especially in attaining the African Pan-Africanism we all aspire to.

My lunch break is one hour and I go to check up on them. So today, I woke up at 5am as usual, my baby akaamka 6 am. Nikamchukua we sat sitting room nikipump maziwa. Baba without manners starts saying niache kazi. He literally told me eti mtoto anateseka asubuhi nikiamka kupump. 

He asked me what I am paid and I didn't give the exact figure (i am working on my exit strategy and I need to save as much as I can). So he tells me, acha kazi, after umetoa expenses unabaki na about 12k. It's not even worth it kuacha mtoto, acha kazi ntakua nakupea kila mwezi. He claims he is not struggling financially. But you and I know if I try that, aaah, baba without manners will have a field day on me. 

Guys, i defended my self. I told him kuacha kazi is not on the table. He was disrespecting me alot vile nimekua dependent on him. I said hio 12k ni kidogo kwake but for me, it is helpful. Until I get something better, that will have to do. I am just happy today that I stood up for myself. 

Baba without manners, I can leave without affection, attention, sex, hugs. But money, money will help me figure life out and finally leave👏👏. I am not a bad mother, I am trying to find myself and be a better mum for my child.

 Picture this.
It's the beginning of the year, and you have a huge fight with your dad. Now you're afraid of staying home when he's there, so you spend your day with your siblings. And when it's time for your dad to come home, you decide to leave and go crash at your aunt's place.

Now you're walking to the stage, and your mum calls to ask about your plan, because you had mentioned earlier that you might leave before her husband is back. So you stop to talk on the phone. Then a car passes you… And it comes back again a few minutes later finding you at the same spot. A guy rolls down the window. He tries to engage, but you're disinterested. He's very persuasive, though, so you give in and go talk to him.

He's good with his words, so he charms you. He suggests you guys go for a drink and catch up. You decline, after all, you're strangers. But he says, ""I work for the government, here's my card, yada yada yada… You can even Google me."" Which you do, and you find it's true. So you relax and agree.

You go to a local in your area, and you're vibing.

All this time, your mum is calling you, just to know you'll be safe out of home. He catches on and realizes you're having issues at home. So he offers to get you a hotel room  a pretty classy one, and says, ""It will be just for you, I’ll go home.""

Now you're relaxed since you don't have to worry about going to your aunt’s, and you start drinking more and more, you have had a rough week. Drinks flow, laughter, and crazy stories, now you’re buddies, it’s like you've known each other forever. And now you're both drunk asf. So he decides to take you to your promised hotel room, but when you get there, you start making out and you end up having some fire sex.

In the back of your mind, you're like, ""Finally, I’m experiencing a one-night stand,"" because with how things have unfolded, you're pretty sure you'll never see this person again. After that, he naps a bit, then leaves because he has work the following day. Cool, no problem. All this time, remember, you have his card, and he doesn’t have your number.

So you sleep and wake up the following day to leave. And when you get home (your dad is at work), you text him just to say thank you for the hotel room.
But that is where you do a fucking big mistake.

You start talking back-to-back.
He's your typical Luo man who knows the game.
Can't fail to mention how mesmerising you are, how he likes you, how he wants kids with you, how he wants to take you home, how he'll come for ruracio.

All this is slowly growing on you. Your guard is down.
You're falling for it.
And every time you talk, your heart is warm.

But that's just the honeymoon phase, haha.
And it's gonna be so short-lived.

Soon, he's taking forever to reply. Doesn't pick your calls.
But still calls you ""baby"" to keep you close.
The cycle continues.
Finally, you realise he's not for you, and let go.
You start mirroring things as you should.

This time, you don't pick up his calls.
Not because you don't want to  but because you've gone back to being a DND warrior, like you were before he came along.

So most of the time, you miss his calls. And when you do pick them up, he's accusing you of being with other men, because he sees them staring at you and kinda feels like you enjoy the attention but you are a fine babe, is it my fault that they look? Are you responsible for his insecurities?

You get tired and end the toxic cycle.

But… two weeks later, after ending things, you realise you are pregnant.
So you reach out, and he accuses you of sleeping around as usual and says he isn't going to take responsibility. But you tell him that's not an issue, because you can't keep it, given the circumstances.

So you ask him to help you get rid of it, and even suggest, if he has any doubts about the kid being his, we can do a paternity test, since it's basically possible.

He refuses. Says you're just trying to extort him for petty cash.
Lemme quote what he says:

 ""I paid for the services. I usually gave you money. So it was an exchange. It’s not my fault you don’t know how to take care of yourself.""



This is the money he'd send randomly, just because you're pretty, or to get lunch, or get your maintenance done.

And now he's suggesting he was paying for services.
Basically calling you a hoe.

You exchange words, back and forth, and you end up giving up.

So you find other ways to find money.
Anyways, your parents’ pockets ain't dry.
And you end up getting rid of it.

You delete his number, photos, but his number is glued to your head because it's pretty easy. But you know you'll get over it someday.

Life moves on.
You recover.
You're thriving.
You only remember the first two digits of his number.
So everything is amazing, and you forget about him.

Until three weeks ago.

Your parents are involved in the matatu business, so sometimes you go see how the business is. You go to the parking lot, it's a petrol station on a Friday evening. You meet your guys basically, people who work for you. And after you talk work, you get drinks and sit outside yapping.

You’re having the time of your life because you guys banter a lot.

Then a car drives in well, many cars did and do drive in, so it's normal. That petrol station also has a club, and it’s a Friday, so it's lit. The person parks right in front of your table as you talk, the person in this car gets out. You meet eyes, and boom, it's the guy from the beginning of the year.

He looks at you intensely, and you feel your heart palpitate fast.
Memories flow back in fast.
Now you are angry. But you don't show it.

He passes your table and says hi . Everyone says hi back.
But you couldn't care less. You continue with your drink.

He does his business and goes to the club.
I hate to say it, but the night is ruined.
So you decide to head home.
That weekend passes.
And so does the anger and memories.
You get over it.
You forget about it.

Until on a Sunday morning, this recent Sunday morning phone is on DND as usual  you are getting ready for a run, and when you wanna set up your phone for the run, you find a missed call. So you call back, and it doesn't go through. But shortly after, someone calls back.

You exchange pleasantries. He says, ""i saw you at the petrol station and you acted like you'd never seen me.""
And you kinda recognise the voice, but now you can't remember who it is exactly.

So you ask, ""I'm sorry, you are…?""

He apologises and ends the call.
So you check Truecaller, and it's the devil himself.

So you text him on WhatsApp.
He calls back, asking to meet up.

And you're there wondering why?

You can’t even trust him. He's in the government.
And you are very loud online, saying, ""Kasongo must go back to sugoi""
So what does he want?
To lure you into an abduction?

But it brought all the shit he did to you back.
And at this moment, all you can do is laugh at yourself.
For being naive.
For letting my guard down.
For letting someone in when he should have remained a one-night stand.

Anyway, we grow every day.
And forgiving yourself goes a long way.
And it's true, it does hurt sometimes.
But you really do get over it.
And you find another life to live.",ruth_reddit.csv

My grandmother has six children; sadly, none of their families seem to be doing well.

1st born (my aunt); her son has been battling alcoholism since 2018. It's only gotten worse. He’s now 28, still lives at home, and the stress has pushed his mother into chronic ulcers. Her daughter was expelled from high school over allegations of lesbianism.

2nd born (my dad); I’ve noticed a strange pattern. Just when he's about to catch a breakthrough, things fall apart. He bought land that was later grabbed; he bought a work car from Mombasa, but it got into an accident before reaching home and was eventually repossessed. He’s been conned out of a lot of money. Just when we thought things couldn’t get worse, my sister got pregnant and we don’t even know the guy (my dad doesn't know about it yet).

3rd born (uncle); he used to be the “rich uncle” we all looked up to. New car every year. Now, seeing him struggle is heartbreaking.

4th born (uncle); he took a huge loan to invest in tomatoes. The project flopped, and loan sharks started threatening him at his business. He had to leave Nairobi and return to the village.

5th born (uncle); he lives in shags with three kids he can’t support. Their school fees are paid by his siblings. My dad, with the little he has, is paying college fees for one of his sons.

Last born (aunt); she’s had a string of failed marriages. Her firstborn recently got so drunk he tried to open the wrong door. The landlord, a police officer, cocked his gun ready to shoot. If she hadn’t stepped in, it could’ve ended very badly.

Looking at all this, I can’t help but wonder; is this a cycle?
I graduated in March and still live at home. Maybe it’s too early to say, but I truly hope the same fate isn’t waiting for me.

We used to smuggle cash in person, stuff it in birthday cards if the sums weren't large. Then when we joined the EU it was just a matter of filling in the IBAN number in transaction request online and the charges are negligible. But it would seem you guys still use the British system of acc numbers and sort codes. The person that would receive the money has a cooperative bank acc, and they said they've never even heard of an IBAN. Another thing we used to do was pay each other through PayPal, making it look like its for services rendered, don't know if that works in Kenya, though.

So my 8-4 is just not cutting it anymore. I'm being overworked for a meagre salo with zero room for growth. Looking at myself, I genuinely feel I have a lot of untapped potential, but this job is not helping me grow or shine in any way. I have a lot of untapped energy.

That said, I’ve made the decision to start building my own brand, slowly but surely. I want to carve out a niche in event organization and hosting.  I’ve done a few gigs here and there on a small scale and made a few coins, and the feedback has always been amazing. Now I want to go full throttle and maybe even take it global someday. I want to build my own thing sababu pia the entertainment industry is not so kind to ladies especially us that are still budding.

To those of you who’ve successfully worked in the events space especially those who’ve done this as hosts or organizers, how do you go about finding serious partners and sponsors? Like actual brands or individuals who believe in your vision and are willing to walk the journey with you? I have the plan, I have my proposals, I have visualized the whole thing. I just need the coin to actualize. Investors in the house,ama tu  kama uko interested DM tuchapiane. I'm not yet quitting but I know I will eventually.

It has been one year since i graduated from nursing school and I have not succeeded in getting any job and the errands that i have been carrying out in town have become less considering most people prefer their products being sent via bikes and ubers coz its timely compared to a person.  Well, after posting my story most people reached out and I am so appreciative especially for the nice words of encouragement and making me feel like am not alone. I have shared my resumes with some people here on reddit and I hope God opens my doors soon. I am still sleeping in town( i talked about being kicked out of my house like two weeks ago) so i haven't really dealt with the housing issue but i am trying all i can. Some men here offered me accommodation but i guess just to be careful i declined and thanks for that. Today i have woken up with a thankful heart and despite everything God will see me through. Some also asked about my siblings- The thing with HIV is that it weakens the body's immune systems and you end up catching any strain of dse passing by. Its not their fault and i assure them all the time. Two of them got admitted with pneumonia last week but after a full day of strong antibiotics they were discharged and the subcounty hospital where they were just let them go like that, i felt like God was answering my prayers coz i don't know what I would have used to pay them.Thats the update so far and I'm grateful for all the love and words of encouragement.

Both times, it’s been girls from my class( starting to think this is a bad idea). The energy starts off strong  we're flirting, talking daily, laughing, vibing. I'm thinking “okay, maybe we’re building something here.” They’re engaging, matching energy, even initiating sometimes. Then… it just dips.

Suddenly, replies are delayed. Conversations go dry. They’re still polite, still replying  but the effort is gone. I’m not begging or overreaching; I keep it smooth, laid-back, confident. But still, they fade  slowly, then all at once.

The weirdest part? Nothing changed on my end. No clinginess, no overstepping just good energy and curiosity. It's like the initial spark was enough for them, but the possibility of consistency makes them pull back.

And yeah, I know sometimes people just get bored, have other options, or aren’t emotionally available… but when it happens in a pattern, it starts to mess with your perception.

So here I am asking  has anyone else experienced this? Why do people lean in, then pull back when it starts to feel real? Is it me? Is it them? Is it just the nature of “vibing” culture these days?

Would love to hear your take. No salt, just trying to understand the game better.

Why is this one so hard to move on from? It’s been two days, I shouldn’t still be thinking about this. I just need to vent and since he frequents here, maybe he’ll see this. Not because I want him to do anything about it, just to get it off my chest.

I really thought I was doing everything right. Communicating my feelings, saying when I’m uncomfortable, avoiding negativity, learning compromise. Yaani, I thought all my bases were covered.

But this man didn’t seem to see any of that. It was just complaint after complaint. Even something as small as his phone ringing would have him like, “fucking hell.” He seemed to get irritated by the wind (hyperbolic)

As someone who’s dealt with an abusive partner before, you learn to sense someone’s mood before they even speak. I found myself doing that again. I even asked multiple times, “When you sigh or curse, are you mad?” Trying to keep the peace.

You’re out here enjoying your weekend while I’ve been in bed crying. You didn’t even say why you broke up with me. And yeah, I know “closure is the actions” but it still fucking hurts. Man woke me up Friday morning like, “it’s time you go home,” and expected me to be rational about the very good news (sarcasm)

Funny enough, the more I thought about how irritated you’d get when your phone rang, the more I realized it was always Brenda calling. The formal way you saved her name didn’t even raise a flag for me, I had seen you take so many work calls.

I think you told yourself, “I have options, so fuck her.” You literally cursed at me, but somehow don’t realize you have your own flaws half of which you’re not even aware of. Being around a complainer is draining, case in point this one time I've complained about the 'beef stew'.

I hope you do explore things with Brenda. Now I understand why you were confused when I didn’t react to the matatu story. You kept yapping about how a relationship is supposed to be and yet, when I said maybe we were rushing, you’re the same one who said we shouldn’t follow arbitrary rules.

The fucked up part is that I’m still trying to understand things from your side. I thought when you saw me on the edge of breaking down, you’d stop me. I thought you’d tell me to keep the promise ring, that we’d talk when things had cooled down. I thought when you called to check if I got home, you’d ask about more than just that. Maybe even explain.

I guess this just proves you’re worse off emotionally than you thought. Enjoy Brenda your names even match, ha! I hope by the time you see this from my side, it’s not too late.

46,Kenya,Age group differences dynamics during dating.,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lc0ua4/age_group_differences_dynamics_during_dating/,2025-06-15 13:52:32,80,"I have a failed talking stage from last month which left me thinking about age differences in relationships. The girl I was talking to was 5 younger than me, she's employed on contractual basis while I'm a self employed person. When it came to putting my cards on the table, I realised that the two of us had different life experiences and expectations, and there was no way we would have worked out. In my late 20s, I have a different perspective of life. I've experienced the good and the bad, I've gone through tough times, business has been so good, sometimes it was so bad I even thought it was the end but eventually things worked out. As we speak, the business is transitioning from a small to a medium sized company which means a sustainable income for me. 




As we talked about these things, I made it clear that I want a partner who understands that there are good and bad seasons. One moment, I'll afford a vacation for us and the next season, my money will be tied up in the business. I'm talking about working capital, salaries, and contributions meaning some luxuries will be off the table. So it will either be her turn to reciprocate or even chip in. The same might apply to her given her current job is a contract. In the current economy, people are getting laid off everyday and as a couple, at the end of the day I'll be her anchor and safe space in case that ever happened. Of course she did not understand this. At that point, I realised that I was talking to an inexperienced person. She did not understand life. I understood why older men with money take advantage of them. 






I also realised that I would feel ashamed of it got to a point where I expected her to reciprocate or even chip in because of the age difference between us. I don't know why I felt that way after that interaction but I decided to shorten my age preference to a 2 years difference maximum. I think that age difference is good and I won't feel some type of way if she was to help out. I also believe that a 26 year old woman has gone through these seasons and understands life better. 





I know the naysayers will come and attack me saying a man should provide blah blah blah but we all wish life was that simple. Businesses fail, people lose jobs and bad things happen
These are the moments you need your partner the most because good times are easy to navigate. It's the hard times that are the most difficult and will tell you who's real. I've seen my friends lose jobs, some closed their businesses and their partners helped out, chipped in, even introduced their boyfriends to new opportunities. One of my friends closed his business and his girlfriend introduced him to a company where he now supplies raw materials.



Now the problem is that most women within my preferred age preference (26-29) have baby daddies, or a lot of emotional baggage and trauma, or are addicted to sex toys. ",ruth_reddit.csv

Our current go-to tech stack is as follows:

Frontend - Next.js

Backend - Nodejs with express

Database - MongoDB and PostgreSQL

Mobile Development - Flutter

Website Development - Wordpress (We have a lot of clients looking for websites, but because our main focus is company systems, we usually tell them we don't do websites right now. But this is extra income that we would like to capture)



If you have any experience with the above, please send me some more information about you, your estimate rates (Of course we know you cannot give us a rate unless we give you a detailed scope, but give me some basic range) and some work you have done so we can outsource some work to you.

I did a little search and realised there's different types of being an introvert for instance I'm an empathetic introvert. That makes me selective towards whom I chose to speak to. But I'm very sociable 

Let's connect the dots, I'm an artist I love what I do in my own space and comfort but I have to occassionally play because that's how you make your ends meet. Before anyone knew who I was in an event we were doing a group activity and the topic was , how do you cope with a mental crisis. In our group a lady mentioned music and I said awesome, without implying a deep interest because listening to music is general.

 I said I meditate and there was a backlash to it. Why, probably because I have this 'bad boy persona', based on how I look in her own words. I look intimidating but deep down I'm calm as ever. After I played everyone wanted a piece of a convo including her, and I was open to talking to everyone but my stress went a little high and I wished I could just sit down like it was a normal occasion 
So that got me thinking do introverts really need friends or just meaningful conversations and relationships.

Being alone most of the times sucks, but being misunderstood sucks even more trust me, hence you constantly hear introverts complain they find socialization hard. I've come to the conclusion you need the right people in your life. In my field of work I've meet many people who say we're friends but really, there's few I can mention I enjoyed being around. It's gonna get crazier when it comes to the dating pool coz people will often love you for the things you do,not who you are. 

Saving myself from that situation I'm building a social life where people know or like me for me. I'm 24m building a music production company, That's my passion. I'm a good listener, if you're interested in some good conversations let's link up. ",ruth_reddit.csv

Ma giz giz tunaenda hatufiki, since jaba is illegal uko, dere na makanga walikuwa wanatema taxin kwa paper ma njege wakiwa on sight then wanarudisha tukiendelea. 
Just past Moshi, we were stopped  by police for the second time,Dere aka arifu makanga ateme ""mirungi"" as they call jaba there. I was kinda sleepy but vile nilisikia dere  akiwarn makanga nika amka. A police officer in white uniform like the Salvàion Army church members entered the bus . He looked around, na I think since mimi ndio nilikiwa nimevaa mavin solo nikasikia "" wewe,njoo nje"" , You know I was like Tf inside my mind.. the police continued by saying "" chukua begi lako pia"" I had my laptop bag on my laps. So I followed the cop. We went behind the bus. Some cop akanimulika kwa uso kiutiaji kama kawaida ya macop ma  ufala tu,you know them..

 Then he said shouted in kiswahili  , "" afande uyu si MTanzania"" ule mwingine alikuwa kwa gari akasema "" kama hana stakabadhi ,piga simu!!""  by now, around three cops were around me, the one questioning me asked, ""unastabadhi?"" I said ndio, I opened my bag and one of the cops took my bag as the other one was provided light with their torch. They checked my bag and I removed my passports and the yellow fiver book,  after that they told me "" toa kofia"" then they started laughing. Izi njege zikaanza kunifwananisha na footballer wao fulani,

 I think my jumper was still having the aroma of Wajakoya, they asked, "" wewe unatumia sigara gani"" tell me without fear I said, bangi , ""lakini natumia Kenya sio uku,"" they didn't bother ( apparently jaba is prohibited than sigara mrefu) after that they told  me "" weka stakabadhi zako pahali tofauti tofauti ndio zisije zikaibiwa zote"".  Before they release me back to the bus they asked, "" unaenda kufanya nini Dar"" I told them kuona msela wangu, and they just told me to get in the bus, this was like 3 am.. I am telling you mi hujiuliza mbona niliwaambia navuta bangi ....... anyways

59,Kenya,I'm in a bit of a sticky pickle.,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1lanwjm/im_in_a_bit_of_a_sticky_pickle/,2025-06-13 18:51:06,23,"Hi Cousins, So I have a friend let's call him Andy. Andy had a crush on a girl about five months ago. I advised  him to shoot his shot but his shot got rejected. He told me and that was the end of it or so I thought. Let's call the said lady Hilda (not their real names). 

  Since Hilda rejected Andy, she kind of moved  out of town for a few weeks and they didn't see each other often. Here is where the twist comes in. Hilda came back a few days ago and I happened to run into her. We just said hello and that was it. She happened to ask me for my number and I thought maybe she just wanted us to be friends. ( we often see each other so I didn't think much of it when she asked me for it). 

   When speaking she asked me If my friend Andy ever gave me her message ? I was shocked as I had never been given any message by my friend from her. She told me that a few weeks before he even ever asked her out she told him to tell me that she was interested in me. I froze as I knew that Andy even went to the point of stalking her insta. She told me that , that was the reason they didn't work out. I had no idea of any of this until she told me. 

  Honestly I think the trajectory of her words hit me really hard, because Andy knew very well I was single at the time but decided not to tell me. I didn't even know what to feel because this was my friend who I had come through for him countless times. So here is what I need you guys to help me out, Should I continue with Hilda and not tell Andy or should I confront Andy about the message he was told to give me by Hilda ???",ruth_reddit.csv

So, the last time I was here, I was in bad shape. Aaai, the headaches almost took me off. But today, I come in peace. Guess what? I just landed a job that I will be starting on Monday. 

I think being on the other side of having an emotional unavailable partner, broke and alone in motherhood has taught me so much. I can finally start taking care of myself, I really thank God. 

Today was my last interview round and all I said was, God, if it is mine, let if come to me. And it did, I was called 5 minutes later to go pick up my documents. Finally, I can start getting my life in order. 

Regarding baba without manners, I let him be😙. I have realised all the time I am always healing from him and I end up having a toxic attachment. One day I am going to come on hear and tell you all that I moved out. In the meantime, lets get this life in order. Thank you all for indulging me.

The other day some aspirant said housing levy itolewe and I just laughed.

Regardless of how you feel you should always remember that cash is king. Huyo Ruto anawafinya, anainua mama mboga na mtu wa boda or rather that's how he makes it seem to them.

That boda guy used to make 50 bob per trip. Now he makes 100 bob per trip. It takes him less trips to make 500 bob a day. Prices of petrol and goods have risen. Do you think he cares? No.

  
His wife/ aunt/sister sells sukuma. She makes 20 bob extra for the same amount of sukuma she used to cut. Yes. she also buys at a higher price. Do you think she cares? No. As long as yeye ako na 350 instead of 200 at the end of the day. 

Their son/neighbor/uncle/bro alipata gig pale kwa affordable housing. Atakuwa chairman kwa committee ya harambee ya kujenga kanisa in a few months time. When they hear you say affordable housing to go or taxes zipunguzwe. They look at you like you are from Mars. Io pesa ikitolewa, pesa ya kuwalipa itatoka wapi?

  
When Ruto/Kindiki visits their towns with empowerment. Huyo msee unampataga base kila siku will sing all day and pocket his 500 bob. That day he sleeps with a full stomach. Probably the last time he ate well was months ago. 

  
Coffee was once selling for 10 bob per kilo. Now it's selling for over 100bob per kilo in several towns. 

Milk is now well worth over sh 50 bob per litre. 

**When you hear Ruto constantly reminding people he has built them shades, markets, employed several intern teachers, made fertilizer affordable etc.. don't assume he is for a second talking to you**. He has his own audience that he is reminding mahali amewatoa and ensuring they don't forget. 

The people who usually come out en masse to vote. Those who brave huge lines. They are several and when you threaten to dip into their pockets. They shall come out in large numbers to protect their interests. Because to them.. if you only remain silent and not criticize...also known as better the devil you know.

  
Ruto has committed several wrongs. His regime is punitive. Ruthless. Inhumane. But don't for a second think that his regime is not benefitting others. 

Anyway. **Tell your favorite aspirants that issuing statements is not enough**. *Ruto is creating an illusion for the masses that historically vote*. They should be ready. Because yeye ako tayari and it won't be easy.

  
Gachagua knows this. Yes. I know you don't think he is an option. But they are people who think he is.

They had a worker late last year, working on a hybrid schedule; they'd come in sometimes, or not. The guy was working on a slightly important project but did not deliver. Day in, day out, it was, ""where's the work,"" ""deadline's passed.""

The guy would say something along the lines of, ""I did the work,"" ""It'll take time to be complete,"" ""The packages are loading."" When he worked from home, ""The lights are out."" The tussles went on, and the guy eventually became rude. He was dismissed for gross negligence, and a host of other issues and paid for his service.

Early this month, the device he was using had to be serviced. That's when *a lot* of the previous projects were discovered. Just about everything that was required. High-quality work; he would have likely gotten a pay rise for this. When he was dismissed, the company had to reassign the work he had been given prior, and no one did quite the job, since it was last-minute work.

If this was Silicon Valley, the organization would approach him to offer a C-Suite position. But it's not. What it is, though, is a waste of time, effort, and talent.",ruth_reddit.csv

There’s a lot of talk online about AI replacing jobs, especially in tech. As someone deeply involved in coding and digital skills here in Kenya, I wanted to clear the air — and also share what’s actually happening in our space.

 Will AI replace programmers?

Yes and no. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and even basic “vibe coding” tools (that turn prompts into code) are automating repetitive coding tasks. Things like:

CRUD apps

Login screens

File scaffolding

Simple bug fixes

Unit test generation


That means entry-level or assistant dev work is changing fast.

BUT…
Here’s what AI can’t replace:
System design and architecture
Deep debugging and optimisation
Secure payment systems (think Mpesa, PayLink, etc.)
Team collaboration and human decision-making
Ethical reasoning (especially around data, bias, and AI itself)
If you’re learning how to think like a developer, not just code — you’re safe and valuable.

So what does this mean for Kenya?
Kenya has a growing dev community — and we’ve got a chance to lead, not get left behind. If we:

Embrace AI tools (don’t fear them)

Learn how to use AI as part of our dev process

Focus on building real solutions (fintech, govtech, healthtech)


We can build things that scale beyond borders. Imagine AI helping you build a local app in Kikuyu, Swahili, or Sheng faster than ever.


TL;DR:

AI is replacing tasks, not thinkers. If you’re learning how to build, solve problems, and work with tools like AI — your value just doubled.



Would love to hear your thoughts — are you worried about AI taking over, or already using it to speed up your projects?",ruth_reddit.csv

So I did what any sane developer would do I left the laptop and took a walk.

There’s this chill spot I love near a swamp. Quiet, peaceful… birds swimming and hunting fish. It’s one of those places that makes you forget your problems for a while. I sat there for like an hour, just thinking about life. The bug had me questioning everything like maybe I chose the wrong path.

As it started getting late, I decided to head back. Then, boom I pass by another chill spot and see a group of 7 or more fine ladies just vibing. They had clearly noticed me earlier and gave me those shy glances. 

Anxienty started kicking in.  
How do I approach 7 beautiful women?  
What if they snob me?  
But then I remembered  my ancestors would haunt me if I chickened out. 😂  
I can’t be defeated by bugs and fear women in the same day.

So I gathered all the courage I had and said:  
“Saseni ladies.”  
And they replied, all smiling:  
“Hiiiii.”  
Me: “Nani ako single nipite na yeye?”

They looked at this young peng in the group and said we’d make a cute match. It's like they had planned for this. We talked for a bit, laughed, and the vibe was immaculate. Right now, I’m about to log off, give this new lady my attention, and forget the bug for tonight.

Background 
Over 18months ago, I shut down my business. 
Since then, I got my first job 8 months ago, but within the first weeks, the nostalgia of being my own boss hit hard. I saw many ways to improve  this person's business and shared with the boss, as an outlet for my nostalgia - to give me a sense of purpose. But they were not receptive. Meanwhile, clients from my old business kept calling me. So a friend shared an office with me, started seeing them on the side, and quit my new job after a month. 
Things were going well, but I was also in debt to X. 
Using this as leverage, after about a month, X wanted me to partner with him with zero capital to run a failing office 30km away. It made sense to me. We would make money and the debt would be paid. 
I am great with marketing and discussed with him the marketing plan and budget. We implemented the strategy and clients went from 0-1 a day to 5-7. Things started getting tricky when he would rather let money sit in the bank than sustain the social media marketing budget. Anyone who's done marketing understands consistency is everything. He would give money for marketing when it's almost end month. Clients numbers dropped to 0-1 a day. All this time, I'm not getting a salary. Only sustinence. Rent, food and transport. Which is a sacrifice for me, so I would still see my old clients to make ends meet. He has staff, who, in three months has been paid only once. He told me he's saving up money so his son can go study abroad and the embassy will need bank statements. 

I've decided to quit, go back to my old clients, apply lessons from my failure and do what I love. I have already paid rent and doing interior design. Running costs are 4 times cheaper than what I was paying before I shut down. 

I consider my debt paid, but he might not think so.

77,Kenya,Usichezwe! How to Buy Original Phones & Laptops from Abroad 📦🇺🇸,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l9fxxv/usichezwe_how_to_buy_original_phones_laptops_from/,2025-06-12 07:02:06,19,"I've noticed a lot of you have been complaining about the electronic devices you buy here in Kenya and how you're now thinking of changing where you shop from and honestly, it's a valid concern.

Recently, I came across this guy on TikTok selling laptops. He has over 200k followers, but people started calling him out because the laptops were problematic especially the batteries. And when you go back for a refund, you’re taken on a whole rollercoaster of excuses and delays.

Same thing with most phone vendors especially those selling iPhones. They know iPhones are in high demand (hotcakes), so they take advantage. Some will sell you a fake one imported from Asia. You’ll buy it thinking it’s legit because the battery health says 100%, then within a week, it drops to 90%. That’s not Apple’s fault it’s fake, plain and simple.

So here’s how you can get your electronics from reputable international stores instead. It’s actually pretty simple:

1. **Know exactly what product you want** – Be specific.
2. **Set a clear budget range** – Know how much you're willing to spend.
3. **Visit trusted US-based sites** like:
   * [Apple.com](http://Apple.com): You’re buying directly from Apple here, whether it's new or refurbished.
   * [BackMarket](https://www.backmarket.com) & [Reebelo](https://www.reebelo.com): These offer refurbished devices. Just make sure to check the seller’s credibility reviews, sales history, etc.
   * **Avoid Amazon** unless it’s from an official store profile. Amazon has a lot of third-party sellers and some are shady.
4. **Choose a shipping company** to handle your delivery to Kenya:
   * Kentex
   * Savo Store
   * Aquantuo 
   * Pick one that works best for you in terms of price and speed. Once you place your order, it’ll be shipped to the forwarding address they provide, and then brought to Kenya. Just be patient sometimes delays happen due to port issues and other logistics.

That’s pretty much it.

And if you're too busy and want someone to handle everything for you, feel free to DM me. I can help you out for a small fee of course.

Lastly, if you still want to buy locally, be cautious. Remember once a new product is launched, manufacturers stop making the older models. So don’t be fooled by vendors saying “brand new iPhone 11” with battery health showing 101% LOL. That’s fake as hell.

Also, the burden of knowing too much.

I saw today an M240i and Golf R smoke a Ferrari SF90. All were above 1000hp though. Saw some old abandoned car and I lowballed a price to the owner because in 2020 I bought a B58 that lies around Buru somewhere and with 1yr of the slow to moderate building, I'd have a fast decent partybus from Japan but with some of the best tech in a car. 

Mapenzi ni upuzi but fun. I miss driving from Isiolo to Meru. This morning I've driven 40km but so fast such that nimerudi gari ikicool you can hear clanking, iykyk. Mrembo finally ameitikia kuwatch GOT na M.I franchise. I did a long term investment but short-term naona shege bana sina pesa. Sometimes living for the future is bs, live in the moment.

I really need some advice.

I recently bought a carpet from a seller I found on TikTok. Her online store advertised a 9 by 12 carpet for Ksh 15,000, which I paid for. However, what was delivered to me was a much smaller carpet – 7 by 9.5.

When I noticed the mistake, I called her immediately and explained that this wasn’t what I ordered. I told her I was really disappointed and wanted a refund or the correct item delivered. Honestly, even if it was a mistake, it should have been clear to her as she was packing the item that it wasn’t the size advertised.

Instead of resolving the issue, she became rude and dismissive. I told her I didn’t trust the process anymore and asked for her address so I could return the carpet or have it picked up. I even told her I felt conned and hurt by the experience.

Now, she’s no longer picking up my calls, and I have no physical address to return the rug to – just her TikTok page and phone number. She was clearly selling from home, and I don’t even know where that is.

I still have the carpet with me, and I don’t want to let this go. What are my legal options here in Kenya? Can I report her? Is there any way to recover my money? I feel really taken advantage of, and I want to take proper action.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

106,Kenya,Thinking of Importing from Alibaba to Kenya? Here’s a Beginner-Friendly Guide on Taxes and Shipping Costs,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1l7f9rk/thinking_of_importing_from_alibaba_to_kenya_heres/,2025-06-09 20:17:34,8,"If you’re new to importing from Alibaba to Kenya, it can feel overwhelming at first — especially with all the terms and hidden costs. I’m still learning, but here’s what I’ve picked up from my experience and research so far:

# 1. What Is Alibaba, and How Does It Work?

* Alibaba.com is a website where you can buy goods directly from manufacturers (mostly in China).
* It’s best for bulk buying — not small, one-off items like on Jumia or AliExpress.
* Prices per item are much cheaper, but you usually have to meet a minimum order quantity (MOQ), like 50 or 100 pieces.
* After agreeing with a supplier, you pay and then choose a shipping method (air or sea).

# 2. Shipping Options Explained

Air Freight:

* Good for small packages or samples.
* Fast (5–10 days).
* Expensive — price goes up with weight and size.

Sea Freight:

* Better for large orders (cheaper per kg).
* Slower (3–6 weeks, depending on port and route).
* You’ll also need to clear the goods at Mombasa Port or use a clearing agent.

# 3. What Does “FOB” Mean?

* FOB = Free On Board. This means the supplier will deliver the goods to the nearest Chinese port, and you handle the shipping from there to Kenya.
* The opposite is CIF = Cost, Insurance, and Freight, where the supplier includes shipping in the price.
* With FOB, you can shop around for a cheaper shipping agent.

#  4. Taxes and Costs at the Port

When your goods arrive at the Port of Mombasa, you’ll have to pay import taxes before collecting them. These include:

* Import Duty – based on the type of goods.
* VAT – 16% of the value.
* Import Declaration Fee (IDF) – 2.25% of value.
* Railway Development Levy (RDL) – 1.5%.
* Sometimes Excise Duty if your product is regulated.

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) doesn’t always use the value you declared — they might calculate their own value using HS Codes (international product classification codes), which could be higher.

#  5. Tips for Saving Money as a Beginner

* Start small if possible — even a sample order teaches you a lot.
* Ask suppliers to clarify if they’re the factory or a trader (factories often offer better pricing).
* Consolidate shipping if ordering from multiple suppliers — it’s cheaper than separate packages.
* Use a clearing agent at Mombasa if you’re new — they handle paperwork and help avoid mistakes.
* Always budget at least 20–30% extra for taxes and fees after your goods arrive.

We've been friends for two decades now. This is a friendship I cherish oh so dearly. I'll write this as a letter. As an archive to remind me how strong this man is, how much I love him, and how much he inspires me.

I call him Toughee. Like the Toughee shoes because of how strong and durable they are. I didn't know romantic love until I met Toughee. He was my first ever crush. And for the longest time we thought that the only way we could express our love for one another is if we were dating. We've long outgrown that. Because we were kids back then. Now we know better. Now we know what we feel for each other can't be confined to a singular description. It's so much more. And it's perfect. But that's a story for another day.


""Toughee, my darling. You are a man of incredible strength and perseverance. I've watched you burrow, claw, and fight your way through absolute darkness and back into the light. Life was incredibly brutal to you at a very very tender age. You didn't deserve it. But you fought hard to be happy again. And to be at peace. I'm so very proud of the man you've become. I'm proud to be your friend. Thank you for letting me in. Thank you for letting me be there for you. It makes me so proud to be part of your journey. To be associated with someone with such sheer will to fight, will to live."" 


""I promise to always be there. And even though I won't always have answers to your problems, I promise you'll never have to carry them on your own. You're an inspiration to many. I hope this excerpt about you inspires at least one guy to open up to someone, because you've shown me that true courage in a man isn't the absence of fear, it is the acknowledgement of vulnerability and the strength to ask for help. I love you dearly. I'm proud of you. I'm happy to be doing life with you. Keep fighting, King!👑""


Idk if Toughee is on Reddit but there's nothing I've written here that I haven't already told him🤭. Guys, Men, you are seen, you are loved, you are appreciated! Do speak up when you need to. Ask for help if you need it. A problem shared is half solved.",ruth_reddit.csv

1. Avoid writing your phone number in estate counter books. Unless you're okay with random SMS adverts.
 
2. Don't give out someone else's phone number without asking them. 
 
3. Use different passwords for your accounts. Add spaces within the passwords and throw in a mother tongue word to make it harder to guess. Using the same password makes your accounts easier to hack.
 
4. Avoid posting your child online with their school details, names, where you hang out on weekends etc and birthdays. It's surprising how many people have their kids' birthdays in their passwords.
 
5. Avoid clicking on pop-up notifications, get an ad blocker on your laptop or use a browser like brave on your phone. On that note, restrict mobile games coz some can be gateways to subscribe you to services that will siphon your money fast. 
 
6. Audit your digital footprint: delete old accounts, log out of public cyber cafes immediately, and avoid mixing your work and personal accounts. If you're in management, change your passwords every three months. Get a good password manager if need be. 
 
7. **Teach your child/ren digital health and safety at their level of understanding early.** Their values are their only defense systems in your absence. Groomers are patient and merciless in preying upon young ones especially banking on their parents not noticing the little things because they're too busy.

I was there to grab an LED keyboard set and an SSD to upgrade my home computer  just a small tech refresh, because why not? A friend of mine works at the shop, so I was hoping to get a decent deal.

While waiting, this guy shows up probably in his late thirties. Millennial vibes for some computer checkup. Since we're all guys, we naturally fell into casual banter. You know, the kind where we’re throwing jokes, talking about life, and just vibing. Most of us there were in our early twenties, I’m twenty-two myself.

As the conversation goes on, I find out he’s a civil engineer. Graduated back in 2017. He tells us that during their time, life after graduation was sweet. You’d land a job almost immediately. In fact, he says within just three months, he bought a car a Volvo. Six months later, all his campus friends had wheels too. Life was moving fast, and in the right direction.

But then things took a turn. A change in government came with a change in reality. He’s currently on a contract to tarmac a road, but the budget has been butchered. The project was allocated around fifty million, yet only eight million made it to his hands. The rest? Siphoned off by top government officials. So now, he’s forced to work with poor mooquality materials and deliver a road that barely meets standards.

He even shared that he’s met politicians who demand roads in their ranches  yes, personal ranches while casually walking around with boxes full of cash. Literal boxes. These guys have more money than they know what to do with. And it’s not clean money. It’s the kind that’s been stolen from public funds, the kind that’s ruined this country’s future.

He said something that hit deep: ‘Nowadays, to get a job after graduating, it’s not about skills. It’s about who you know.’

I’m about to graduate. And to be honest, I don’t know how I’ll survive out here. Sometimes I find myself wondering if I should just dive into washwash or some shady hustle. But then again, would that really change anything? No. It would just make me part of the same system that’s already sinking the country. And it’s dangerous.

So here’s the real question: if you’re a fresh graduate, or about to become one, what do you even do? How do you make it in a system where merit doesn’t matter anymore?""

Our dad had this small library for us, na huko tulikua tunatoka tu wakati wa kuoga, kukula, na kuendea maziwa, because we had housemaid and farm boy.

So matime ilikua imefika ya kuendea maziwa, three kilometers away, juu ile ng'ombe yetu ya maziwa ilikua imepigwa baller, ikaamua maziwa haitoki. 

So it was just feeding, depositing ammonia and sleeping. Haijui vile ilinisaidia kutoka jela kidogo, ile furaha nilikua nayo, I would supply to five depressed guys na wasahau shida zao walai.

So we went with my bro, had time to chat juu library hakukua na kupiga story, laugh and enjoy the freedom.

At around 8p.m ndio tulikua tunarudi nyumbani, so we got to the kitchen placed the milk kwa meza and left, but before tutoke kitchen, there he was, very mean face at the door staring us.

Mi ni kama niliona tiger kwa mlango hio siku.

He looked scary akijam, so we hesitated to get to the kitchen's door.

""Wapi mtoto?"" He roared.

""Mtoto mgani?"" I responded.

If only we could have the ability to time travel and I had to change something, mimi ningechange hio part, nifyate ulimi.

That's how I borrowed 10kgs of a blow, ngumi ilinituma kwa mchanga tukabanja na mchwa dakika moja pale.

""Umemuumiza baba Colin."" My mother tried to defend me, lakini when it came to this prison wardener, kichapo haikua na conditions, hata sauti ya mpenzi haingesaidia.

My bro disappeared from the kitchen kama sungura, sijaijua huyo morio alipita aje mzae,  but he was not in the kitchen when I got up.

I was surprised which baby this mzee was asking, then I heard mom, ""Mbona mlienda na Ferdy kuchukua maziwa na ni mtoto bado, hata hakua na sweater.""

I swear to God I didn't know that son of troubles, kijana ambaye anatumia mguu kufikiria followed us.

Hata sikua nimejibu mom, nyaunyo ilikua ishanilamba mgongo, I walked like a kangaroo mpaka nje, mgongo ilikua imepinda kama bakora ya kukaa, lakini mguu haikutaka kusikia hivyo tena.

Now we were having a conversation kama niko 100 metres away, ""Mi sijui Ferdy ako wapi?"" Kiburi ilikua imepanda.

""Muende mtafte mtoto ama msirudi hapa."" He screamed.

Sisi na bro were clueless, 'saa tatu ya usiku jamani kwani sisi si watoto pia?' I thought.

""Tusipopata huyu mjukuu ya wazee wasumbufu mi naenda kitale kutafta job."" I furiously suggested.

""Hatuna ID."" Ndio ule kijana mwoga akanijibu.

""We unataka kufa ama kuishi?"" I asked him.

Before he responded, a bright flash light was directed to our faces. How you know the countryside norm, by saa tatu watu wamelala, and no lights outside, giza totoro.

We were scared but didn't care, because we had no home if we don't find that stubborn kid.

""Colin."" I heard the neighbor calling.

""Mnatafta huyu."" He continued.

Mimi sikutaka kujua neighbor ni mzae ako na family, before I even said a word, nilikua nishapakulia huyo msumbufu kijibare hapo, akatoka mbio mpaka nyumbani.

""Asante."" We told him and followed that cheeky boy home.

Mzee alikua hapo nje kwa uwanja with mom, and the mischievous kid.

""Kujeni hapa!"" He roared.

""Lala chini!"" He commanded. 

Mischievous kid alikua side yake, he was given one whip, aiyaya yaya yaaa, it seemed hurting, juu he woke up na kukalee around the big house mara tatu as he grabbed his sitting apparatus.

Mimi nilikua numb walai, couldn't even move, ni ka nilikua nimesniff bangi ndoo mzima.

My bro was the next, moja, kijana alipiga nduru ni kama mtu anaenda jehanamu, and then ladies and gents it was my time.

Ile methali ya cha mwenzako kikinyolewa chako tia maji, waliambia wale wako na time ya kutia maji, I had no time. 

Nilipachikwa uchungu nanii, mimi sikuzunguka nyumba, nilipata muscle pool. 

'Eeei jamani, kwani sisi tulikuwa watoto wa nani?' I thought.

""Kuja umalizie yako Ferdy, alafu nyinyi mmebaki na mbili ndio msirudie hio mchezo."" Mzae claimed.

'Nimebaki na mbili?' I was thinking of just escaping and never come back.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and things have generally been great,until recently. She’s started expressing frustration about the “amount of love&time” I show to my dog. 
For context, my dog is 16 years old. He’s been with me through every major chapter of my life through high school, college, the loss of family members, breakups, moves, everything. He’s not just a pet to me, he’s my family. With his age and declining health, I’ve been extra attentive lately making sure he’s comfortable, spending quality time with him, even turning down some social plans so I can be there if he needs me.
My girlfriend says she feels like she’s “competing for love” and that she “shouldn’t come second to a dog.” I get that it might feel that way sometimes, but I’ve tried to explain that this is temporary. I’ve reassured her I love her deeply and want a future with her, but my dog doesn’t have a future not a long one, anyway.
She recently told me she’s thinking about ending the relationship because she doesn’t want to be “in a relationship with someone who’s emotionally unavailable due to a dog.” That hit me hard,it was unexpected

I want to speak to someone who’s been working hard, doing all they can, but still wondering, “What’s the point of it all?” You wake up early, go to work, take care of your family, try to do what’s right but you still feel tired and stretched thin. If that’s you, God sees you and He is with you in the ordinary.

Solomon, the wisest man to walk this earth outside of Jesus had everything. Power, wealth, success. He built houses, planted vineyards, gathered silver and gold but when he looked at it all, he said it felt like chasing the wind.

Solomon is showing us where joy is found. Not in what you don’t have but in what God has already placed in front of you.

That job you have? That’s a gift.
That food on your table? That’s God’s hand.
That breath in your lungs? That’s grace.

Too many of us are waiting for a breakthrough before we thank God but Ecclesiastes teaches us to see the blessing in the now. God moves in Mondays, in lunch breaks, in honest work, in quiet evenings... He is in the small things just as much as the big ones.

When you begin to recognise His hand in the simple, your heart becomes satisfied. That’s what Solomon meant. You stop chasing and start resting. You stop striving for meaning and start receiving it.

And this comes second to nature subconsciously. I asked around from friends and they honestly don't care much and it got me thinking if I am alone.

There is so much disinformation out there about so many issues affecting and surrounding the African being down to our anatomy that I think always using western blanket impositions is dangerous especially in attaining the African Pan-Africanism we all aspire to.

125,Africa,Where are we with the Africa Continental Free Trade Area agreements?,33,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc5gny,2025-06-15 17:10:54,20,"The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is (or rather *should be*) the largest free trade zone in the world by far. The AfCFTA is already much larger than the European Union and ASEAN. This is good, cause it means we have alot of consumers *and* producers.

The AfCFTA aims to reduce tariffs on 90% of goods traded between African countries, and remove non-tariff barriers like customs delays, and conflicting regulations. The point is to make trade between African nations easier by encouraging the development of regional supply chains and industries rather than the old model where raw materials leave Africa only for finished products to be sold back to us. If fully implemented, this could stimulate intra-African trade to grow by more than 50% from current levels (I think it's at like 15% right now. Europe is at 60 and Asia is at 30).

As of today, 48 African countries have ratified the agreementHowever, actual trade under AfCFTA rules is still super limited. To ease our way into it, a Guided Trade Initiative (GTI) was launched in late 2022. This pilot scheme currently includes Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania, Tunisia, and more recently South Africa. Only around a dozen countries have fully begun trading under AfCFTA protocols. The rest are still preparing.

I think part of the issue here is that not all African governments are equally interested or capable when it comes to free intra-African trade. Some fear loss of revenue from tariffs, others worry about exposing fragile domestic industries to competition. The other issues are ever-present in discussions about Africa; poor infrastructure and conflict in certain regions.

I still think this could and should be done before 2035. This is one of those things where we are only held back by how effective our governments are.

Slaughtering Technique of Mammals in Ancient Egypt

>The first stage of butchery is falling down the animal on the ground to be slaughtered

>The technique of falling big mammal on its back aimed to immobilize it for slaughter. Several butchers were involved. The animal was trussed three of its legs together with a rope. Some scenes show one man has a rope round the bull's head to force down the head. The second one is making a slip knot over its free front leg. The rope is being thrown over the animal's back and pulled down by a third man. Another man holds the rope and puts one of his legs on the rear leg of the animal to prevent kicking. Additional pressure on the horns forced the animal to be thrown on the ground on its back. small mammals (goat, sheep, and gazelle) do not need a crew, one butcher or his assistant can bring the animal down to the ground to get full control of the victim.

>Once animal is merely immobilized and laid trussed on its back, the butcher says a formula over the animal by way of consecration"" ""A sacrifice to N"". He holds the throat to one side and cuts the arteries of the neck by a deep cut through the windpipe, then the blood has spurted out'. The butcher makes another cut across the throat to speed up the bleeding

Eleanor Xiniwe was a Xhosa singer who was a member of the African Choir who toured London in the UK from 1891 to 1893. Alongside her husband, Paul Xiniwe, they formed an organisation that sought to unite African people in their struggle for political rights. Eleanor and Paul were members of a small group of educated South African elite that were involved in national politics, while working towards social change and self-government.

This includes improvement in public housing, healthcare, education, and public spaces that are accessible as public goods.

My son is in school in Sierra Leone, and recently a teacher told him he either had to cut his hair or go to the administration. The thing is, he currently has a low afro, and we’re going through a spiritual situation, the spiritual leader we’re working with advised that he shouldn't cut his hair for now. But when my son explained this, the teacher didn’t even care. No space was given for spiritual or cultural considerations.

This made me start thinking about the wider issue:
Why do we keep forcing Black boys to cut their hair short, like their natural hair is unattractive or problematic?

We act like short hair equals discipline and respect, and anything else is “unruly” or “gang-related.” But these are cultural hairstyles, deeply rooted in African identity, braids, afros, cornrows, locs. These styles were part of who we were before colonization. So why do we now look down on them?

Many boys don’t even realize they’re suffering hair loss early on because they’re always cutting it short. By the time they notice thinning or a receding hairline, it's too late, and they have to keep cutting it to hide it.

Meanwhile, kids from other backgrounds, Indian, Pakistani, etc. — are allowed to grow and style their hair in peace. But when a Black boy does it, suddenly it's a problem?

Is it about discipline, or is it something deeper, something internalized?

I make sure my son keeps his hair clean, styled, and neat. So why should that be a problem?

Would love to hear how other people feel about this, parents, educators, students, anyone really.",ruth_reddit.csv

Africa isn’t just a spectator in the global power shift — it’s becoming a core engine of it.

As BRICS+ expands and de-dollarization accelerates, African nations are building independent financial structures like PAPSS to bypass dollar dependency. Major countries are forming bilateral trade deals in local currencies, while infrastructure and digital development are increasingly backed by China, Russia, and Gulf powers — not the West.

At the recent BRICS+ summit, African leaders openly rejected the “rules-based order” narrative and emphasized sovereignty, fair trade, and a multipolar world.

I will be the kind of leader who builds systems that last, even when I am gone. Not just a savior for today, but a visionary for tomorrow. Because Africa doesn’t just need heroes, we need architects. Builders. Mentors. People who think beyond their time.

I will confront tribalism, because it’s one of our deepest wounds. In Sierra Leone, our politics are tribal. In many African countries, it’s the same. People vote for bloodlines instead of ideas. For faces instead of futures. And what do we gain? Poverty. Division. Stagnation.

I am Fulah, and I have faced tribalism in my own land. But instead of bowing to it, I chose to rise. While others laughed at us for baking bread or making shoes, we built homes, paid school fees, and created our own economy. We hustled with dignity. And now, they see us.

Across Africa, we must destroy the lie that office work is the only success. We must raise a generation that is proud to hustle, to sell cold water if they must, because there’s no shame in working. The shame is in pretending.

I will not make excuses. If a leader cannot deliver in their first five years, they don’t deserve five more. Blaming the past will no longer be accepted. We need results, real, measurable results, within two years. If not, you step aside.

My vision is for every African country to build systems that cannot be corrupted, overturned, or sold. We need constitutions, not just campaigns. Institutions, not just speeches. We must train successors. We must multiply minds, not just raise monuments.

I want to wake up Africa, not just from colonial hangovers, but from our own self-inflicted limitations.

One speech can start a revolution.
One generation of builders can finish it.",ruth_reddit.csv
154,Africa,Queen Nandi of the Zulu Kingdom 🇿🇦,1515,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knvkgl,2025-05-16 08:12:14,58,"These are some photos captured from scenes in a South African local television series called ***Shaka Ilembe*** which is a production for a channel called Mzansi Magic from the Multichoice company. The series has been acclaimed as South Africa's most expensive show to date - recounting the story of King Shaka of the Zulu Kingdom and his quest to fight for his throne. It stars Nomzamo Mbatha (the lady in the photos) as Queen Nandi who is the mother of a child called ***Shaka kaSenzangakhona*** and prominently known as Shaka Zulu. 

The series premiered on 18 June of 2023, and recording 3.6 million viewers in its first week as the best ratings ever for a Multichoice-produced drama series. In September 2024, ***Shaka Ilembe*** became the most nominated drama series in the history of South African Film and Television Awards, with 17 nominations. At the 18th SAFTA ceremony held in October 2024, the series won 12 awards, including Best TV drama - the most of any nominee - and garnering Multichoice a total of 46 awards.

M-Net and Multichoice had officially announced the series in May 2018, with four years of planning prior to the announcement. Production took six years to complete with the consultation of historians, academics and family descendants - including the likes of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini. During this time the American network called Showtime had planned to film their version with a backing of $90 million, yet eventually scraped their production which was towards completion. 

Location scouting for the series commenced in 2019, with principal filming of the series taking place in 2022 at the prime sceneries of the Greater Cradle Nature Reserve, in the towns of Eshowe, Nkandla Forest, Port Edward, Drakensburg, Mooi River and Zulu Falls in KwaZulu-Natal. This process involved more than 120 builders and thatchers from KwaZulu-Natal engaged in building the sets of traditional architecture and other components. Filmmakers had to stick to a more rigid building schedule to abide by the prescribed on-site protocols in accordance to the strict rules of the nature reserve. According to crew, the sets in Johannesburg took over nine months to build.

The series is written with a cinematic symbolism of storytelling that encapsulates the beauty, confidence and courage of a woman by the name of Nandi - who later became known as the mother of a king and one of the greatest military leaders in the history of Africa. Queen Nandi's early life remains somewhat shrouded in mystery, but is known that she was born into the *Langeni* clan and her life took a dramatic turn for many controversial reasons. The history begins when she had met a man known as ***Chief Senzangakhona kaJama*** (Shaka's father) and fell pregnant with his child. At the time, Senzangakhona already had two wives who had not yet bore him an heir. In spite of Nandi bearing a male child (the supposed heir), her pregnancy was received with shame as it was considered a disgrace to her family due to the out of wedlock status. It is also suspected that their relationship was considered illicit because Nandi and Senzangakhona were too closely related by blood. This familial connection made their union problematic, especially in the eyes of their respective clans. When she informed the elders  about the pregnancy they refuted her claims by stating that she had been infected by the *ishaka* beetle – an infection associated with stomach bloating - to shield the family from humiliation. In the years to follow, Nandi would be subjected to great humiliation and rejection because of her circumstances. It is also reported that she was given the title of third wife but without the customary rituals that would render such a marriage illegitimate. She bore *Senzangakhona* a second child (a girl called ***Nomcebo***) but life in their homestead was not pleasant and safe for them, which led to their departure due to the persisting ridicule and unsafe environment. During this time of seeking safety, Shaka himself was subjected to humiliation and bullying by older boys, who referred to him as, “the fatherless one”. 

Nandi and her children found refuge with the ***Mthethwa*** clan (led by chief ***Dingiswayo***) where Shaka as the eldest child had learnt and devised military tactics. Shaka proved to be a fearless warrior and rose through the ranks of the Mthethwa army, being named by Dingiswayo as his successor before Dingiswayo's assassination in 1817. When *Senzangakhona* passed away, Shaka became the *iNkosi* (a king) of the respective clan. He appointed *Nandi*, ***Mkabi*** (Senzangakhona’s principal wife), ***Mkabayi*** (Senzangakhona’s sister) and ***Nomcoba*** (Senzangakhona's daughter) as the reigning queens and princesses of his military homesteads. Despite being abandoned during pregnancy, humiliated, and her young life filled with sorrow, Nandi remained steadfast and confident in her son’s destiny. It is well known that Queen Nandi was rather a powerful force of moderation and exercised a great deal of influence over the affairs of the Zulu monarchy which had culminated in separate clans uniting to form a centralised state/kingdom. She, alongside the other women aforementioned, are a primary focus of maternal leadership that is honoured within profound traces of history and deemed as a story worth telling.

Queen Nandi is therefore particularly admired for her role in the unwavering support of her son's ambitions, the strength to overcome limitations, and the lasting impact of the women in the Zulu nation. The series pays homage to an important figure in African history, but overall a tribute to a beautiful and resilient culture. Season 2 of the series is said to premiere on June 15th in 2025 - picking up with Shaka and Nandi arriving at *KwaNobamba* where he begins his reign as the new Zulu king.",ruth_reddit.csv

156,Africa,Why Are Africans Still Religious?,211,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1kn4rfk/why_are_africans_still_religious/,2025-05-15 10:23:03,151,"I don’t ask this questions to mock anyone’s faith or belittle their religious journey. I just can’t truly wrap my head around how deeply we’ve committed ourselves to a belief system that was handed to us through unimaginable violence, exploitation, and dehumanization.

- One of the earliest slave ships that brought Africans to the Americas was literally named “Jesus.”  

Let that sink in. The name of the very symbol of salvation in Christianity was etched on the side of a vessel carrying shackled human beings across the Atlantic, torn from their homes, their culture and their families. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_of_Lübeck

- White Christians used bible verses and bible stories to justify slavery. 

- There was even a point in time where they debated whether to baptize enslaved Africans because they weren’t sure if it would make it “wrong” to keep a Christian as property. But eventually they quickly “resolved” the issue, not by freeing anyone but by changing their theology. 

They started baptizing Africans, called them “saved” only to sent them straight back into the fields to continue suffering in chains. That was their idea of spiritual enlightenment.

Fast forward to modern times and things aren’t much better. 

Prosperity preachers, both Black and white, across Africa and the Western world have discovered modern ways to manipulate and profit from African religious devotion.

They promise miracles, breakthroughs, and divine favor in exchange for tithes from people living in poverty and struggling to feed their families. 

It’s become a spiritual scam, millions of dollars siphoned from the desperate hopes of the faithful. These preachers live in mansions or are relatively wealthy while their followers return home to poverty and continue clinging to the promise that God will reward their sacrifice someday, if not in this life then in the next.

Despite all of this, Africans remain among the most devout religious in the world. Over 60% of Africans identify as religious and a vast majority are Christian. 

How? Why? 

After everything, how have we not questioned the spiritual systems that were imposed on us by those who enslaved, colonized and brutalized us?

Sometimes I genuinely believe that God hates Africans/Black people because if you look at how the world is structured in terms of how power, privilege, and protection are distributed, it’s pretty evident we are doing the worst. 

Nearly every country on every continent, darker skinned people are treated poorly by nearly every measurable standards. We are at the bottom of the social hierarchy everywhere so much so that a majority black like countries like Nigeria, skin lightening creams are very popular. Anything to get proximity to whiteness and some distance from blackness.

You’d think that if God were truly loving, compassionate and a Justice God, He would have done something by now. 

I mean after centuries of slavery, colonialism, apartheid, genocides, poverty, racism, wouldn’t we have earned some divine intervention? 

No other group on Earth has suffered this consistently, brutally and universally across time and space the way Africans and Black people have.

So where is God in all of this? 

What is the evidence that God is on the side of Africans? What historical moment shows us that God has stood with us, fought for us or elevated us? Because all I see is suffering and not just from the distant past but from the present ongoing reality.

Durinf the time of slavery, the major religions didn’t oppose it, they endorsed it. Christianity and Islam both either condoned or regulated slavery. 

They taught “kindness” to slaves not liberation. And if we’re being honest, the Arab slave trade was even more brutal and dehumanizing than the Trans-Atlantic one. Castrations, death marches, and the complete erasure of lineage were not uncommon. And yet somehow, we’ve embraced both religions as our spiritual identities while the Western world has thrived at our expense. Every ounce of their development came at the exploitation and suffering of Africans. 

Yes every group has suffered in some way. But our suffering has been disproportionate and sustained.


If God is truly loving, merciful, and all-powerful, and if Africa despite being the most religious continent on earth continues to suffer as one of the poorest, then what does that say about His concern for us? 

How can a just and compassionate God watch as an entire continent so faithful and devout, endures such relentless hardship, poverty, and pain?

And if God is omnipresent and omniscient, fully aware of everything and everywhere at once, why does He allow such deep-rooted hatred and inequality to persist especially against Black people across the globe? 

Why is it that no matter where we go, we are often at the bottom of the social ladder? Why is there never a version of the world where Africans rise and succeed, where we flourish while others struggle or even a world where everyone is on equal footing?

Sometimes I think it borders on Stockholm syndrome the way some of us have embraced the very religion used by those who dehumanized and oppressed us. 

Not only did we adopt their religion but we are even more holy than them. We once had our own rich cultures, spiritual systems and traditions but all of that was stripped away grom us. And now generations later, we cling to what was forced upon us as if it was always ours.

Lastly, I believe Religion is part of the problem. Aside from being exploited by the West, A lot of Africans believe religion is a substitute for hard work. 

If you pray hard, pay your tithes, go to church regularly and serve God with all your heart, then you will do a lot better than the person that have worked 10x harder than you. 

Religion is the main source of hope for a lot of Africans. In the face of bad governance, poverty, underdevelopment, people have little to look forward to asides from religion. 

Christianity and Islam promises a good life after death and possibly on earth. Do this and that and receive God's blessings. If we just keep praying and depending on God. He will save us from poverty and corrupt leaders which is not true but it’s what people believe. 

People in Sierra Leone and across Africa are especially guilty of this. When I visited Sierra Leone with my siblings, my grandma would wake us up every morning to go to church. She was a very devoted Christian despite her old age. 

My aunt was also in the country because she was supposed to get married. And during tithes, the church collected it. At the end of the service, they handed all the money to us, I guess to bless my aunt for getting married. 

I know they had good intentions but I hated it because I doubt they would’ve done the same for any local African family. They only did it for us because we were Westerners.

In the end, my family never accepted the money because we didn’t really need it but that incident did not sit well with me when they could’ve given that money to Africans who had nothing.

Another thing I hated was how this church didn’t provide any food or drinks for the guests. All their money went into the building, into lavish clothes/shoes, ceremony, repairments to fix the church but not buying food and water for their guests who came to church. Religion and the Church was always more important than feeding starving people. It's sick 

And poverty is so terrible in Sierra Leone that on the day of my aunt’s wedding, hundreds of uninvited guests showed up, not for the ceremony but because they heard there would be food. At the end of the night, children were literally fighting each other outside over food. 

It really makes me sad. 

And that’s why I stopped believing in Christianity. I used to think ignorance kept us sick and poor. But the more suffering I see, the more I experience, the more I read and reflect, the clearer it becomes.

If this God exists, He’s either cruel, indifferent, or completely powerless. None of those options are comforting. None of them deserve my worship because It’s very heartbreaking watching my people and Africans suffer for generations while being told that our prayers and our trust in God will save us yet it hasn’t. 

And at some point, we have to ask ourselves, if this religious system isn’t saving us, why are we still defending it? ",ruth_reddit.csv

I grew up in a former French African colony. Like many of us, I thought French civilization was the peak of human achievement. Why wouldn’t I? I was raised on French literature, those old black-and-white films with De Funès, Jean Gabin, Delon, Ventura. I even spoke the language with a generic Parisian accent—despite not being French or even living there.

Then came French schools, French book clubs, the French high school diploma, and finally the privilege of studying in France.

I wasn’t the best student, but I always had this urge to deeply understand things before accepting them. That’s when I began to regret brushing off philosophy. Turns out, it’s not just abstract fluff—it’s a rigorous method to structure thought. Even mathematics, I realized, is just philosophy dressed in symbols.

But once my studies were done, I was hit with something I didn’t expect: a deep, almost institutionalized self-loathing in the country I once revered.

Not the kind of introspection that makes people kinder or more open-minded. No, this was something more vicious. A culture that punishes effort and rewards inertia—all in the name of buzzwords like “inclusion,” “diversity,” “foreign aid,” and “subsidies.” Empty mantras the average person doesn’t really buy into but is too tired or scared to question.

How did a country that once symbolized reason, order, and rural richness become a machine that spits out nonsense—and punishes those who try to love it?

Eventually, I understood: the people had been sedated. Numbed into apathy while global elites used their taxes to fund influence-peddling in *our* countries and got rich off it. It only works if the French people are passive enough not to realize they’re footing the bill—and the ""returns"" won’t benefit them or us.

Sound familiar? Promises of rosy futures, calls for sacrifice, a little more patience… We’re all on the losing side of this global con. France just uses slogans and bureaucracy; we get tampered elections and outright censorship.

We’re told to “improve governance,” “be more transparent,” and then maybe, *maybe*, we’ll earn some IMF blessing. But it’s just chess, and we’re playing with a single black pawn while others hold the board.

But there *is* another path. Not sexy, not shiny. But real.

It starts with fiscal discipline. Real investment in education—paying teachers decently, teaching three languages, philosophy, and math. That’s it. Strip it all down. Fund it through reallocating existing budgets, not new loans or flashy “projects.” Make debt interest payments transparent and boring. No mega-projects. No empty hospitals. No grand highways mortgaging the future.

Just calm, disciplined, transparent stewardship of what little we *do* control.

It won’t impress anyone on LinkedIn. But it would build generations that *think*, who don’t blindly copy but question, root themselves, and act with independent minds.

Why are we so obsessed with the flashy? They were never meant for us. And the more we chase them, the more others will treat us like well-dressed beggars.

So yeah, a zebu-drawn chariot is no Tesla Cybertruck. But at least it’s made with *our* wood, *our* iron, and *our* hands.

We just need the courage to start from there—and believe it’s worth doing.

Me? I came home. Never bothered getting a French passport. Didn’t see the point. Too much bureaucracy, and honestly, I don’t recognize what that country’s become.

New Brunswick will look to negotiate an exemption to federal immigration targets, according to its intergovernmental affairs minister, as it looks to attract more newcomers from Africa. 

Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Jean-Claude D'Amours, who is also the minister responsible for immigration, unveiled a plan Thursday to increase the number of francophone immigrants from six African countries over the next five years. 

That plan specifically calls for more students and workers from Morocco, Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Cameroon, Senegal and Tunisia. 

….

New Brunswick could benefit from Prime Minister Mark Carney's campaign promise to increase francophone immigration outside Quebec by 12 per cent.

""I think we will be able to convince the federal government, hopefully, to make sure that we will be receiving an exception,"" D'Amours said. 

""Today we talk about the francophone countries. So as the only bilingual province in the country, we have a beautiful opportunity to convince the federal government.""

163,Africa,Polygamy Isn’t Fair,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1khlb2o/polygamy_isnt_fair/,2025-05-08 08:48:29,65,"I want to start by saying that I’m not trying to offend anyone with this post and If I do I apologize in advance. I don’t want to come across as or harsh or accusatory because that’s not my intention at all. But this is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time because growing up I’ve never been able to fully understand polygamy or why so many women even today are still okay with sharing their husbands with not just one but two or more other women. 

I know this isn’t a new concept that appeared out of nowhere. Polygamy has deep roots in African cultures and predates colonialism by centuries so it’s not a imported or exploitative custom that Europeans brought to Africa. And I don’t believe that it started because men were irredeemably greedy or lusty. I know that historically there were many different reasons polygamy made sense in African societies and sometimes it even served a beneficial and compassionate role in how communities were structured. 

For example in rural areas in Africa, when it came to subsistence farming, having multiple wives could mean having more hands to work the land, grow food and raise children. Other times, it acted as a form of social protection. If a woman’s husband died and she was left with children, polygamy offered a socially accepted way for her to remarry to a new man without shame or being ostracized for having had a previous husband or child. It made it easier for widows and single mothers to be reintegrated into a family structure. 

It also created shared responsibility where another woman could help raise her children and give her a break by providing a support system. Polygamy also helped women financially and emotionally. And as for men, they would marry multiple women to demonstrate their wealth, power, and social rank. So I absolutely do understand that polygamy historically came with certain benefits and I’m not blind to that. I’m not ignoring context or trying to reduce it to something shallow. I get that there were cultural, social, and economic reasons that made it make sense at one point. 

But what I don’t understand and what really confuses and sometimes upsets me is why this practice still continues today when so many of the original reasons no longer apply and when frankly, it’s being abused in ways that harm women and children more than it benefits anyone.

Take my own family as an example. I have an uncle on my father’s side who is Muslim and has three wives. Two years ago, he got a young woman in her twenties pregnant (even though he’s in his 50’s) and she gave birth to a daughter. This woman wasn’t one of his three wives. So now technically, he’s adding a fourth wife or maybe not even making her a wife, just someone else to add to his expanding list of partners and children. And when I heard this, I was angry. Because I couldn’t for the life of me understand how a man who already has three wives and several children could continue bringing more people into his family when he clearly wasn’t doing a good job providing for the ones he already had. He doesn’t even have a job, my dad sends him money to take care of his his multiple families and he’s taking advantage of my dad kindness by having more children that my dad will have to fund. And things like this are not rare, they’re very common in Africa. 

I see too many African men using polygamy as a free pass to chase their sexual desires, to indulge in fantasies of dominating multiple women, to gratify urges that go far beyond what religion or tradition ever intended. And it’s sad to watch because life in Africa today is not easy. It’s hard. From a financial standpoint alone, most men are struggling to support even one wife and her children. The nuclear family is barely holding itself together under economic pressure. One man trying to support multiple families without the resources or money to do so is just irresponsible and often the women and children suffer for it. 

Unless a man is truly and independently wealthy and committed to caring for all his wives and children equally, I don’t see how polygamy can function as anything other than a drain on everyone involved. And most men who engage in polygamy today are not independently wealthy. They’re not building empires that will take care of their families, they’re just multiplying their responsibilities while failing to meet the most basic ones.

What also bothers me very much about the whole thing is the gender inequality embedded in how polygamy is practiced and defended. Men are allowed to marry multiple women and have sex with all of them but women are never allowed to do the same. I’ve asked so many people; religious people, elders in my country and friends why is it okay for a man to have multiple wives but not okay for a woman to have multiple husbands? And every time, the answer I get is the same that men are capable of loving multiple women equally but women are not and that answer makes my blood boil especially when it comes from other women. I expected them to understand my side but they’ve also internalized this belief and now use it to defend a system that treats them unfairly. 

I remember when I was once interested in converting to Islam. I had a Somali friend who was passionate about Islam and she told me I could ask her questions I had about Islam since she was teaching me, and I remember learning that in Islam, men were promised to have 4 wives. It really shocked me so I asked her why Muslim men could marry four wives but Muslim women couldn’t do the same. She explained it to me in several ways and among her reasons, she said that men are capable of loving multiple women equally but women could not manage that same kind of love. That stuck with me and not in a good way. It felt like such a sexist and unfair double standard. 

Why is love gendered? Why is a man’s heart seen as wide and boundless but a woman’s heart seen as limited and untrustworthy? And even beyond love, people give all these other “logical” reasons why women can’t have multiple husbands. They say things like, “It would be too dangerous” or “She could be raped” or “How would we know who the father of the baby is?” But these are excuses to me. Technology can now determine paternity. Safety is a societal issue, not a reason to control women’s relationships. So it starts to sound less like genuine concern and more like control disguised as tradition. 

Men are never called “whores” for being with multiple women even when they abuse the privilege. But if a woman so much as implies she wants multiple husbands, it’s seen as immoral and impure. I believe If polygamy is going to exist in modern times, then it needs to be practiced with true equality. If men can have multiple wives, then women should be allowed to have multiple husbands; anything less than that is just selective privilege.

That being said, I personally disagree with polygamy overall even if it were made equal. While it does offer some structural or communal benefits in certain cases like shared responsibility in child-rearing or financial collaboration, I just don’t believe that it’s emotionally or psychologically sustainable for most people. The power imbalance, the divided attention, the constant comparison and competition between spouses takes a toll on both parties.  And I think we’re fooling ourselves when we pretend that everyone in that dynamic is okay. Because someone is always going to feel left out. Someone will feel less loved. Someone will notice the emotional favoritism, the unequal treatment, the subtle withdrawal of affection. 

No matter how much a man claims he can love all his wives equally, he cannot. He will always have a favorite. There’s always going to be one wife he loves more, who gets more attention, more affection, more time. And then there’s going to be another wife who’s basically neglected, who feels unwanted, unloved or only tolerated because the man is “obligated” to provide for her. I’ve seen it happen in real life when I went on vacation in my country. Women competing for the same man’s attention so much that it causes them stress and heartbreaks and I don’t think love is meant to be split like that. I don’t think we’re wired to thrive under those circumstances.

And on top of that, I feel very sick to my stomach knowing that in polygamous marriages, men can sleep with multiple women in the same week or even in the same day while each of those women is expected to remain exclusive to him. He gets variety, stimulation, attention and they get to wait their “turn.” It’s a paradise for him and purgatory for women. And yet women are always expected to be the loyal ones. They’re expected to be patient, understanding, and non-jealous. And if they complain, they’re seen as ungrateful or overly emotional. Meanwhile the man gets to enjoy all the benefits without ever being expected to show the same level of loyalty. 

I know a lot of these things has to do with consent and that women consent is needed in Polygamy and it matters very much. But again just because something is agreed upon doesn’t mean it’s fair. If one woman agrees to share her husband because she’s afraid of losing him if she doesn’t accept him getting another wife or because she’s been raised to believe she has no other choice, is that really enthusiastic consent? Is that really love? And if she is faithful to one man and she gives her entire self to him, shouldn’t he be expected to do the same?

167,Africa,Kenya proposes to South Africa.... 🇰🇪🇿🇦,509,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf99fq,2025-05-05 11:28:38,47,"In December of 2019, two strangers were among thousands of young people who had been invited to attend a prestigious program called World Youth Forum in the city of Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt. However, John Nyagaka from Kenya and Anathi Tshabe from South Africa were two worlds apart that were oblivious to their fate as they did not anticipate to be drawn into the embrace of a happy ending while pursuing their respective professional ambitions. 

As the days of the program progressed, and shortly after three days upon the inception, John states that he noticed Anathi wandering alone among other participants in an overwhelming crowd. He was in the company of a Nigerian friend when Anathi caught his attention and curiosity persuaded him to approach her. They engaged in a brief conversation while exchanging contact details. Anathi has expressed that John couldn't escape her eyes afterwards, and which is quite interesting as she had not identified him anywhere prior to their meeting. She disclosed that their love story is a testament to alignment - suggesting that John's appearance was not simply a coincidence, but rather a purposeful and divinely guided event in her life. John has equally expressed that their connection was a beautiful cliché of timing. They believe that they were in the right place at the right time. 

The conclusion of the program's duration in Egypt culminated in John and Anathi intending to keep in touch as they looked forward to a new year of uncertainty. They fostered a friendship to develop a foundation that would help them navigate compatibility. Anathi frequently visited Kenya to familiarize herself with John's immediate upbringing, and this involved following in the trails to his childhood in Kisii among other activities. On the other hand, John also extended the courtesy by embarking on trips to several parts of South Africa and particularly Anathi's home of Queenstown in the Eastern Cape province. John's heritage of Kisii alongside the Xhosa origins of Anathi present an intercultural affinity that has inspired a blend and balance of novelty in their love. The pair experienced the trust between their distance evolving into a stronger and closer intimacy. Without fail, they eventually transitioned into a genuine and enduring romantic relationship. 

In the near end of 2024, John set himself apart as a man with a sincere desire to commit to a lifetime with the start of a shared life. He carried a ring in his pocket and a promise in his heart as he gracefully walked into the sunset of Nungwi beach in Zanzibar to go down on one knee and ask for Anathi's hand in marriage. The successful outcome of the proposal had the couple jubilating in happiness and excitement for the beginning of a new life together. 

Anathi is an LLB graduate from the University of the Free State, and an admitted attorney of the High Court in South Africa. She recently completed a Masters of Management Science in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University in China on a Schwarzman scholarship. John's background encompasses interests in education, information technology and health. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the Ashesi University and is currently studying a Masters program of Health Informatics at the University of Toronto in Canada to catalyse his passion for harnessing technology in healthcare systems. 

In spite of the aforementioned prospects, the engaged couple has adamantly reassured a priority to tie the knot and strive for a prosperous union.

Just to be clear this is an excellent system and I believe in all the freedoms that come with being part of a liberal democracy. That being said, there are legitimate reasons for an individual to criticise this system and in time, offer something better. My concern comes in when your only argument against democracy is it being a foreign import. That’s the lousiest thing I’ve ever heard.

My proposal? A democratic technocracy.
1. Citizens retain the right to vote for parliamentary representatives and the Head of State. Ministers and their respective ministries remain fully technocratic, selected by a technocratic council of professionals for their success or knowledge in relevant topics.

2. The role of parliament is strictly to be the voice of the people, perhaps by contesting policies that would disadvantage their specific constituencies.

3. Media regulation. Non-partisan government organisations dedicated to fact-checking all traditional and social media and labelling misinformation promptly. This would encompass distorted facts, misrepresentation or distortion of statistics, etc.

4. Separation of powers. The checks and balances that keep the executive, judiciary, and legislature in line.

5. The technocratic council. A very key part of making this system work. Nominated by the Executive based on credentials, experience, peer recognition, and performance in simulated policy challenges. Preliminary checks for conflict of interest. Elected members of parliament or their respective ministries citizens themselves vote to approve or reject nominees. 
Comprises experts from key sectors (Economics, Law, Medicine, Armed forces, Education, etc) Strict term limits. Subject to judicial review.
The role of the council is to develop policies based on peer reviewed evidence to be debated by the parliament and implemented by the executive.

Benefits? Self explanatory
- The prioritisation of metrics like Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, or social progress indices over GDP.
- The elimination of politics from problems like climate change, vaccination,  fire arm regulation, and social service provision (food safety, 
health care, education)

Challenges?
-Issues like history, identity, and culture could potentially take a back seat especially if they lack representation on the technocratic council.
-like any other system, the potential for anarchy in case the people feel that their voices are unheard.

My argument is that this is an objectively better system than a liberal democracy, and somewhat original enough for us to call it ours (the continent’s).

176,Africa,Will Mogadishu Collapse in 2025?,80,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbo4x6,2025-04-30 18:47:33,58,"I genuinely don’t understand how Somalia is still functioning as a state right now. It might come down to sheer Somali resilience because from an outside perspective, it's hard to imagine the country holding together much longer. The Somali National Army appears seems sluggish and fearful, and from what I’ve seen, they're losing territory at an alarming rate.

Back during the Obama and Biden administrations, there seemed to be a clear American rationale for pushing back al-Shabaab. There was a belief that the group could potentially train terrorists who might later threaten American or Israeli interests, or destabilise the Horn of Africa more broadly. The horn is geopolitically crucial because of its proximity to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden which are major arteries of global trade.

But since Trump took office, al-Shabaab has gone on the offensive.They seem to be hoping to seize Mogadishu itself. I don’t see the U.S. maintaining the same level of commitment to Somalia’s defence as it did a decade ago, especiallt now that they cut USAID. Turkey seems to be stepping in, and while Turkey's isn't a military to sneeze at, it's not America.

I see parallels in Sudan, but the key difference is that the Sudanese military despite its flaws is better trained and armed than Somalia’s. From what I understand, Somali troops often retreat when faced with Islamist militants, or they simply refuse to engage unless they have backing from a local clan militia. The population is also deeply afraid of al-Shabaab, which makes sense. But fear doesn’t build a successful resistance movement.

Under these conditions, I can’t see a path to military victory for Somalia’s army. If al-Shabaab does manage to seize Mogadishu, I dread to see a future where the country collapses completely. Somaliland would probably be well positioned for global recognition if this happened. They might even engage in a brief conflict with the south over disputed territories. Somaliland has a significantly more organised military than Somalia. I could see Somaliland holding its own longer than Somalia.

Another major conflict worth following on the continent.",ruth_reddit.csv

179,Africa,The trail of legacy in the life of a beauty queen 🇿🇦,131,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kamtuf,2025-04-29 12:35:23,5,"Shudufhadzo Musida, affectionately known as Shudu, was crowned Miss South Africa in 2020. She proudly hails from the province of Limpopo in South Africa, and making her the second titleholder from this region since the reign of Bokang Montjane. 

Limpopo is a South African province that is bordering Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It's known for bushveld and wildlife reserves, including part of Kruger National Park. West of the Kruger are the craggy **Blouberg mountains** and **Makgabeng Plateau** with ancient rock art. Near the provincial capital Polokwane, the **Arend Dieperink Museum** and fossil-rich caves of **Makapansgat** explore history dating back to early hominids. Limpopo is also home to to the renowned *Limpopo River*, which is the second largest African river that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the *Zambezi River*. The Limpopo River rises in South Africa and flows generally eastward through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean. The term Limpopo is derived from *Rivombo*, a group of *Tsonga* settlers led by *Hosi Rivombo* who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. 

The ancient **Kingdom of Mapungubwe** was a historic Iron Age settlement and kingdom located in what is now the Limpopo province of South Africa. It thrived between the 11th and 13th centuries CE, primarily because of its location at the confluence of the *Limpopo and Shashe Rivers*, which facilitated trade and access to resources. Mapungubwe's location at the junction of the *Limpopo and Shashe Rivers* was crucial for its prosperity. The river provided access to the coast and facilitated trade, and the surrounding savannah was suitable for cattle herding. The river's strategic location allowed Mapungubwe to participate in long-distance trade, exchanging local resources like ivory and gold for goods from the East African coast and beyond. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe thrived in part due to its access to resources and trade routes along the *Limpopo River*. It is believed to have declined in the late 13th century due to factors like resource depletion and shifts in trade patterns, with Great Zimbabwe later emerging as a major power in the region. Mapungubwe is considered one of the earliest examples of a centralised state in Southern Africa, and it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site contains numerous archaeological remains, including evidence of trade, settlements, and royal burials, providing insights into the history and culture of the Kingdom of Mapungubwe.  

The predominant ethnic groups that reside in the Limpopo Province are namely the Pedi people (***Bapedi)***, the Venda people (***VhaVenda***), and the Tsonga people (***Vatsonga***). The Venda people in particular are known as ""composite people"" due to the tapestry of a rich lineage that incorporates elements from various groups, including East African, Central African or even the fellow Southern African influences of Nguni and Sotho people. They believe that ancestors are active in their daily lives and communicate with them through rituals, oral storytelling and ceremonies. Some of the traditional practices would encompass traditional dances (like *tshikona* and *malende*), music, and drumming. The Venda language, ***Tshivenda***, is an official language of both South Africa and Zimbabwe. The Venda are believed to be related to the inhabitants of the ancient Kingdom of Mapungubwe. 

Remarkably, Shudufhadzo Musida is the first winner whose first language is Venda (***Tshivenda****)* and went on to represent South Africa at Miss World 2022, finishing in the top 40. The name Shudufhadzo means ""*we are blessed*"" or ""*to be blessed*"" in her mother tongue. Shudu made history as the first bald woman to win the Miss South Africa title - embracing her unique beauty. As a dedicated advocate for mental health awareness, an author, and a humanitarian, her passion lies mainly in empowering marginalised communities.

Shudu's academic journey began with a Bachelor of Social Science degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Pretoria. She then earned an Honours degree in International Relations from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Currently, she is pursuing a Master of International Affairs at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) in New York, where she focuses on global development, human security, and policy innovation. Additionally, Shudu has been appointed as a Global Champion for Women and Girls by the UNFPA, advocating for universal access to sexual and reproductive health and mental health for women and girls. On the 9th of April 2025, she had the honour of moderating a high-level UN event on **Prioritising Sexual and Reproductive and Health and Rights (SRHR) and Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in Crisis Response** at the United Nations headquarters. She continues to balance her academic ambitions and social activism. 

Her impactful work has garnered attention from prominent media outlets, including Vogue Italia, British Vogue, and Glamour South Africa, where she has had the grace of appearing on dual magazine covers. Furthermore, she is the author of *""Shudu Finds Her Magic,""* a best-selling children’s book that addresses bullying, as well as *""I Am Shudu: Finding My Voice, Knowing My Strength,""* which inspires young girls to celebrate their strengths.

Shudufhadzo Musida embodies a well-rounded and inspiring individual whose contributions to society reflect not only her beauty but also her commitment to making a meaningful difference. She is remembered for her poise, heritage, intelligence and charm. ",ruth_reddit.csv

Could it be just a new form of neocolonialism with outside powers taking advantage of local people and resources? For example, in the DRC, we often hear about children working in dangerous conditions mining cobalt — a resource that's essential for things like electric car batteries and smartphones. Even though there’s huge international demand and profit, the local communities seem to suffer the most, while foreign companies and buyers benefit.

On the other hand, do you see any economic value or development opportunities when foreign investors come in to extract resources?

You had sex, a child came out of it, and now you're acting like you carried the whole world on your head for doing what you're supposed to do. 

Nobody is saying parenting is not hard. It is. But stop guilt-tripping your children because you paid school fees or bought food. That’s your responsibility, not a favor.

You didn't do extra. You did what was expected.  
You brought a life into this world, and it's your duty to cater for that life, not use that as a weapon later on.

Some of you will say “After everything I’ve done for you, this is how you repay me?”  
Yes, because you're not supposed to 'OWN' your child’s life.  
You’re supposed to raise them, not control them.  

This mindset of entitlement is the reason many adults are broken today.  
They can’t make decisions freely because they're scared of ""disrespecting"" their parents.  
They can't chase their dreams without fear of guilt.

Let your children live. Let them breathe.  
Stop holding your sacrifice over their head like a debt they must pay for life.  
You did your job. Do it with love and leave the rest.",ruth_reddit.csv

184,Africa,Motswana lady walks us through the elegance of Southern African traditional attire 🇧🇼🇿🇦🇱🇸,439,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7zv9z,2025-04-26 00:10:14,19,"Tyra Molosi hails from Botswana as a beauty and lifestyle content creator, as well as the Chief Executive Officer of Sahara Scents. Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa with a landscape defined by the Kalahari Desert and the Okavango Delta, which becomes a lush animal habitat during the seasonal floods. The massive Central Kalahari Game Reserve, with its fossilised river valleys and undulating grasslands, is home to numerous animals including giraffes, cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs. The predominant ethnic group in the country are Batswana - whom are also significantly found in the neighbouring country of South Africa. 

Batswana belong to the Sotho-Tswana ethnic branch comprising a large and diverse group of people, predominantly found in South Africa, Botswana, and Lesotho. They are considered a meta-ethnicity, meaning they are composed of several distinct groups with overlapping cultural and linguistic ties. There are a number of distinguishable dialects within each of the main Sotho-Tswana languages, but they remain largely mutually intelligible. The languages have a rich history and are closely tied to the cultural and social fabric of Southern Africa. The ethnicities are Batswana, Basotho and Bapedi whom speak the languages of Setswana, Sesotho and Sepedi. This connection can also be emphasised in other aspects such as the shared heritage of traditional attires. 

The dress worn in the pictures by Tyra is a traditional garment made from ***shweshwe*** fabric. She is commemorating the cultural pride of a printed dyed cotton fabric widely used for traditional Southern African clothing. Originally dyed indigo, the fabric is manufactured in a variety of colours and printing designs characterised by intricate geometric, and in this case, concentric circles and squares.

The local name *shweshwe* is derived from the fabric's association with Lesotho's **King Moshoeshoe I**, also spelled *""Moshweshwe""*. **Moshoeshoe I** is said to have been gifted with the fabric by French missionaries in the 1840s and subsequently popularised it. It is also known as ***sejeremane*** or ***seshoeshoe*** in Sotho as well as ***terantala*** (derived from Afrikaans ***tarentaal***). It's also important to note that in spite of it being a principal attire for Sotho-Tswana ethnicities, there are also other groups who had adopted the clothing in their own capacities. The fabric is known as ***ujamani*** in Xhosa culture (whom belong to the Nguni branch) after 19th century German and Swiss settlers who imported the *blaudruck -* meaning blueprint in German *-* fabric for their clothing and helped entrench it in Southern Africa. In Botswana, this traditional fabric is typically known as ***leteisi***. It is therefore interesting to observe the different contexts in which the fabric was introduced, and how it has evolved in distinct designs within the respective cultures. 

*Shweshwe* is traditionally used to make dresses, skirts, aprons and wraparound clothing. *Shweshwe* clothing is traditionally worn by newly married Xhosa women, known as *makoti,* and married Sotho women. Xhosa women have also incorporated the fabric into their traditional ochre-coloured blanket clothing. In Botswana, the fabric is also traditionally associated with brides and married women, but has recently moved into much wider popularity in casual settings. 

Aside from traditional wear, *shweshwe* is incorporated in contemporary Southern African fashion design for women and men from all ethnic groups, as well as for making accessories and upholstery.",ruth_reddit.csv

186,Africa,The story of wheels and smoke 🇿🇦,380,https://v.redd.it/iu687jjj6twe1,2025-04-24 18:04:52,13,"This is a motorsport culture called spinning - originating in the prominent township of Soweto in the 1980s. The quintessential car that is used to engage in the performance is the infamous BMW 325iS model, and what is locally acclaimed as ***gusheshe.*** It was one of the first BMWs to be assembled in South Africa, and thereafter making it a symbol of local automotive heritage. The car is honoured as a priceless luxury and referred to as a ""ghetto hero"" because of its popularity and association with the township culture. The term *gusheshe* essentially encompasses the car's overall cultural impact which represents an alignment of resilience, community, and a shared identity within the South African context. 

The history of car spinning - particularly its connection to gangsterism - is rooted in the sociopolitical landscape of South Africa. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was embraced as a flamboyant display that was often associated with stolen cars and commemoration of certain criminal activities. It was regularly performed as a funeral ritual in which a stolen car was spun around to honour the deceased in the black communities of South Africa, and mainly in Soweto. The motorsport emerged during the apartheid era and was therefore also used as a rebellious medium for marginalised groups to express frustration and dissent.

Over the years, it has evolved from a criminal act and transitioned into becoming a popular pastime that has been formalised as a legitimate and regulated sport with promoters such as Red Bull, talented performers, and cheerful spectators. **Red Bull** ***Shaya'iMoto*** is a massive spinning competition which was launched in 2019. The phrase ""shaya imoto"" is in the Zulu language and can be loosely translated as ""hit the brakes"" to allude to the anticipation of a car stunt. Spinning has culminated as an authentic performance art and cultural phenomenon throughout South Africa. 

Interesting fun fact is that spinning is also closely associated with the legendary ***Kwaito*** music. Kwaito is a South African music genre that was developed in the 90s by blending elements of house music and traditional South African rhythms. It is generally characterised by its fast-paced, often repetitive beats, heavy bassline, and lyrics frequently exploring the realities of township life. This is a genre that has also laid a foundation for subsequent music styles such as ***Amapiano***, and profusely celebrated for its timeless legacy. It plays a distinguishable role at sports events and symbolises the unique street culture in South African townships. The combination of the high-energy spinning activity with the music creates a special aesthetic and sensory experience. 

It is also important to note that spinning is not necessarily synonymous with what is conventionally known as drifting. Spinning and drifting, while both involve a loss of traction and sideways movement, are distinct techniques. The former emphasises controlled rotation and a complete turn in place, while the latter focuses on maintaining control and navigating a corner or turn while sliding sideways. Spinning is often associated with entertainment and stunts, whereas drifting is a motorsport governed by rules and formats. Spinning is uniquely South African. ",ruth_reddit.csv
187,Africa,African problems,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1k6th7d/african_problems/,2025-04-24 14:22:27,11,"The main challenge with Africa isn’t that there aren’t resources or that Africans are some how inferior to other places or peoples:

It’s that African elites don’t see the need to invest in their people. They find it more profitable to extort and exploit citizens and live as second class citizens in other people’s capitals in Europe and America. 

Countries don’t develop because the people are special or they run into some huge sum of money. Countries develop when the political elites and economic elites to decide to extend their power for purposes that improve the quality of life for fellow citizens. This hasn’t happened in Africa in general, and worse off in non democracies.

So the question is not whether Africa should pursue a Chinese model or an American model. It about a political culture and institutional culture that forces both the economic and political class to see the benefit of investing in their respective countries, so that they would good for themselves in the process. The cost of underdevelopment should hurt them first. 

Economic models like state led, free enterprise, or mixed methods often lead to the same outcome without a change in the political culture of the society. 

We have a culture problem. And it’s not a culture of being less than as Africans, it’s a culture of exploitation, arrogance, and limited faith in ourselves or our people.

Poverty is spiritual.  
Kidney disease is spiritual.  
Not getting married is spiritual.  
Exam failure is spiritual.  
Liver disease is from village people.  
HIV too? Village people.

How your village people infected you with HIV when you were the one that had five sex partners, raw, no protection, I don’t know. Did they follow you into the room? Or were they the ones pressing your phone when you ignored your test results?

At this point, you just have to ask: when will we, Africans stop blaming every other person but us for the poor choices we made? When will we begin to take responsibility and accountability for our choices?
 
You failed to submit your final year project on time, village people.  
You haven’t found a job, village people.  
Your child isn’t reading, village people.  


But can we pause and be honest for once?  
It is not your village people. It is you!

You didn’t study.  
You didn't take care of your health.  
You didn’t save money.  
You didn’t respect your body.  
You ignored signs.  
You skipped classes.  
You refused to plan.  
You kept postponing.  
You chose vibes over discipline.

But no, village people must collect.

This is not to say spiritual things do not exist. Of course, they do. But we have to stop using “village people” as a lazy excuse for everything. It is not only limiting, it is dangerous. It stops us from looking within, from growing, from learning.

This mindset exerts real effects on us in Africa, and there are consequences. Real consequences.

People delay seeking medical help because they are praying against spiritual arrows.
People stay in abusive situations thinking it’s a test of faith.
We do not learn from failure. We blame external forces.
We avoid therapy because we believe the problem is not mental, it’s spiritual.
We don’t hold ourselves aaccountable instead we spiritualize irresponsibility.
We demonize success so much that if someone succeeds, it must be jazz.
We hide behind religion while ignoring common sense and boundaries.
We mock logic and science, yet wonder why progress is slow.
We fear progress because we believe there's an invisible limit holding us back.

Let’s be honest with ourselves.

Every setback is not spiritual. Every failure is not from the village. Everything wrong with your life is not witchcraft.

192,Africa,"What do Africans living in Africa think about Abortion? Do you guys think Abortion is right or wrong? Good, bad or neither?",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1k43ie9/what_do_africans_living_in_africa_think_about/,2025-04-21 02:59:41,63,"I’m curious to hear African perspectives on abortion. This is purely out of curiosity because here in America, Abortion is a very polarized topic and people are extremely divided. 

Pro-Life people view abortion as the intentional ending of a human life (many say it's murder) even at the earliest stages of pregnancy. They say that just because the embryo isn’t fully developed doesn’t make it any less of a life. To them, killing an unborn child is no different from killing a born one since according to them, it’s still a person, just at a different stage of development.

There’s also a common belief among Pro-Life that many women push for legal abortion simply to avoid the consequences of sex: unplanned pregnancy. They see it as a way for people to escape responsibility. And honestly, I can understand that viewpoint to some extent based on what I’ve seen. 

Back when I was in high school, there were many girls in my class that were sexually active. I wasn’t because my parents are African and very strict and I valued my life too much to even try it. But many of the girls in my class didn’t come from strict households, plus didn’t take their education seriously. Men were mostly their priority and focus so they were much more free in that sense. 

There was one girl in particular, I didn’t know her personally but we had a mutual friend. She was part of the group of girls at school who were sexually active. My friend, who knew her well, would sometimes gossip about her to me and once told me that the girl had said “If I’m pregnant, I’ll just get an abortion.” And in the end, that’s exactly what happened. She disappeared from school for many months and I found out through that same friend she had gotten an abortion.

Now, seeing how normalized abortion has become in America especially among people in my generation, it really brought that memory to me in the present. It made me realize how quickly people my age tend to turn to abortion, with no hesitation, no emotion, it’s a quick decision for them like it’s nothing. It’s casual for them as getting out an appendix out. Abortion doesn’t feel like a moral dilemma anymore and many people actually encourage abortion even despite the women having unprotected sex with her own free will. 

On the other side of things, with Pro-Choice, there are people who believe abortion should remain legal and accessible and should be no reason to make the woman a slave by undermining her right to her own body. And that forcing a woman to have a child even though she doesn’t want it (and in some cases rape) can cause the baby to be born in a undesirable life of poverty, neglect, and instability. The mother may also feel deep resentment towards the baby since the child serves as a reminder of her actions. 

The baby could also virtually destroy the life of the mother because she won’t be able to go to college. She may have to drop out of school to get a job in order to provide for the child which could finically make the life harder for the mother and her family. 

So this begs the question: Should life be born even if they’re going to grow up in an unwanted sub-par living conditions that not even convicted criminals would want have to be born at all? Should life be forced upon women even if it’s cold, harsh, and unforgiving? Would you personally allow your kids to get one if she got pregnant young or from a situation like rape?

I’m not here to start a debate, just genuinely interested in hearing your personal thoughts on abortion. Growing up in the West, it’s easy to get influenced by the dominant narratives here so I’d really like to hear how older Africans especially those living on the continent see this issue. 

I’ve heard that in many African countries abortion is illegal or highly stigmatized but I also know opinions can vary based on religion, education and personal experience so not everyone is a monolith ",ruth_reddit.csv

What do you need to know is im a law graduatw currently finishing my masters degree in tunisia and so intrested im politics news

After the president took over the authority and took down the parliment order in 2021 i noticed our relation with our african nations is getting worst each year especially after him speaking publicly about some imaginary conspiracy of "" changing the demographic system od tunisia"" which putted us as a tunisian people who once were the sysmbol of democracy and culture now as a racist offendors 

Dont get me wrong im not trying to justify the action on the immigrants offenders i truly believe they need to be punished also cuz what theh did is a crime in our law , however due to this joke administration the agression rate towards immigrants keeps getting high and high everyday and let me try to tell you why from my humble prespective 

Imagine your ""leader"" keeps telling you everyday and on every single occation that there is some sort of schemes and attacks against our social security besides from the other not trying to find solution for the immigrants here who are stuck with us in this failed regime knowingly he took money from the EU to keep the in tunisia so logically he needs to organize their residency in here to avoid conflicts with locals and keep their dignity as human being , sadly what i talked about still not even on the disussion table because the administration still playing the easiest card to avoid its responsibilities which is the victim card and always trying to blame its faillures on the conspirances and sometimes on the poor immigrants themselves 

I wanted to say a big part of the tunisian people are against this policies and incase we try to protest we will be accused of treason ( thats why i want to hide my identity ) , but to our african brothers/sisters i want to say tunisia is not racist , it misguied by an insane president and people are afraid thats why we see those actions ( yes from a narrow scale there is racism like anyother place even between locals me as southern man would be discriminated in multiple occations but thats doesnt necessarily mean all people are racisit )  , just patience like we do here as locals cuz we are in this sht together we also as citizens not being able to access effciently to simple govermentale services such as police services ..etc 

We still have hope guys and everything wil be okay over time we as tunisians proved multiple times we overcome dictatorships and thats what we are going to do one more time to create a good living for all of us

Africa's leading gold producer is shifting away from a system in which local and foreign companies with export licenses can buy and export gold from artisanal or small-scale mining.

Under the new system, the newly created gold board known as GoldBod is the only entity allowed to buy, sell, assay and export artisanal gold, Monday's statement said, and older licences have ceased to be valid.

Foreigners must leave the local gold trading market by April 30 although they can apply ""to buy or take off gold directly from the GoldBod,"" the statement said.

Finance minister Cassiel Ato Forson said in January that the creation of GoldBod would allow Ghana to benefit more from gold sales while maintaining the national currency's stability.

Ghana's gold exports grew by 53.2% in 2024 to $11.64 billion, of which nearly $5 billion was from legal small-scale miners.

So the UK and EU just launched a new campaign to send million upon millions of dollars to Sudan (>120M notes). Not only does this raise huge questions for me about their intentions but it highlights the absolute insanity of this pointless conflict. 

1. It has been repeatedly shown that he RSF steals aid. If they are allowing aid in now, how did the UK accomplish this monumental feet...also why was is not all over the news? Also, why can't they just do this for the whole war! Like if they made negotiations with her RSF to lay off so they could deliver aid......why not do that same thing and END THE WAR? If they armed themselves and sent guys in? How did they manage to passify warring solders and why not passify ALL OF THEM? if we got in and out peacefully there has to be something to the magic we can use to fight the RSF? 

2. How do we know he RSF won't just take the Aid as they have done for 2 years? For months and months this has been an impossibly to send aid and suddenly we can bus in millions of notes in aid? The vast majority of last year the US was trying to send 3 trucks of aid and basically failed. You get me? 

3. Why hasn't the US or UK investigated the UAE when there have been several limes of very clear evidence from reputable sources hat he UAE is funding the RSF? Why not put millions into a formal investigation to where we can charge the UAE for war crimes thus ending the war. I think that's considerably more effective then pouring MONEY on a fire hoping it goes out soon?? Yet there is 0 mention of the UAE despite the US and EU having numerous talks with UAE leaders regarding Sudan in the recent past? On top of that, the UK DIDNT INVITE the Sudanese government to a peace talk regarding Sudan. In what way shape or form does that make any sense? 

4. The UAE and UK are close allies and 78% of the Gold leaving Sudan is going to the UAE.

The director of elections at the Independent National Elections Commission, said that Chadema had failed to sign a code of conduct document that was due on Saturday, meaning the party was disqualified from October's elections.

Last week, Chadema's leader Tundu Lissu was [arrested and charged with treason](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98gg7172ymo) following a rally in southern Tanzania at which he called for electoral reforms.

The CCM party, which has governed Tanzania in a grip since 1977 has been responsible for brutal torture, abductions, and killing opposition leaders. This is the first contested election since Vice-president Samia Suluhu ascended to president after the death of John P. Magufuli in 2021. Suluhu had earlier on rolled back some of the oppressive actions of Magufuli in what was seen as a promise towards more electoral reforms. Since then the government has regressed to targeting opposition as elections approach.

Dozens of opposition leaders and activists, including Lissu, were either arrested or assaulted by the police last year. Several prominent Chadema activists were murdered. Lissu had returned in 2023 from exile after surviving being shot 16 times in a 2017 attempted assassination.

Now they've banned their main opponent after calls for electoral reforms.
